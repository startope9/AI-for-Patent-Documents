DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION An exemplary embodiment of an inventive coffee filter roll is seen generally at 100 in FIG. 3. As shown in the perspective view of FIG. 3, the coffee filter roll 100 generally comprises a plurality of coffee filters 10 successively arranged in a roll configuration, each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 being detachably coupled to one another, and each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 including a plurality of fold lines configured to facilitate an insertion of each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 into a coffee filter basket of a coffee maker; and a plurality of lines of weakness 26 , each of the plurality of lines of weakness 26 being disposed between adjacent the coffee filters 10 in the coffee filter roll 100 . Each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 in FIG. 3 is configured to be separated from the coffee filter roll 100 by tearing the coffee filter 10 being removed from the adjacent coffee filter 10 in the coffee filter roll 100 along at least one of the plurality of lines of weakness 26 . For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the coffee filter 10 a at the end of the roll 100 is being separated from the coffee filter 10 thereabove along the line of weakness 26 (i.e., the coffee filter 10 a is shown partially severed from the coffee filter roll 100 in FIG. 3 to illustrate an exemplary manner in which a coffee filter 10 may be removed from the roll 100 ). In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 3, it can be seen the coffee filters 10 are rolled around a center cardboard tube 82 , which adds to the overall rigidity of the coffee filter roll 100 . In one or more embodiments, the coffee filters 10 that are rolled in close proximity to the center cardboard tube 82 (which will be dispensed when the roll is about finished) are provided with colored edges (e.g., pink edges) or a numbered countdown in order to signify that the roll 100 needs replaced soon. Referring again to FIG. 3, it can be seen that each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 in the roll 100 is generally octagonal in shape with a plurality of octagonal sides. Also, each interior one of the plurality of coffee filters 10 comprises the lines of weakness 26 on opposed octagonal sides thereof. In one or more embodiments, each line of weakness 26 comprises a plurality of spaced apart elongate perforations (i.e., elongate slits) that allow the coffee filter disposed at the end of the roll 100 (e.g., coffee filter 10 a in FIG. 3) to be easily separated from the remainder of the roll 100 . For example, the lines of weakness 26 may comprise ¼″ long slits spaced apart by ¼″ between slits, ⅛″ long slits spaced apart by ⅛″, 1/16″ long slits spaced apart by 1/16″, 1/32″ long slits spaced apart by 1/32″, etc. Now, turning to FIGS. 1 and 2, the structural features of a first exemplary embodiment of a coffee filter, which is utilized on the roll 100 of FIG. 3, will be described in detail. The coffee filter 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2 is primarily designed for use as a basket-type coffee filter, but can also be used as a cone-style coffee filter. Initially, as shown in the top view of FIG. 1, it can be seen that the coffee filter 10 comprises a generally octagonal coffee filter body 12 with eight (8) octagonal sides. The octagonal sides of the coffee filter 10 are spaced apart from one another by substantially V-shaped notches 15 (i.e., wide V-shaped notches 15 ). Also, it can be seen in FIG. 1 that the coffee filter 10 has a plurality of radially extending fold lines 18 , 20 that are grouped together in a plurality of generally V-shaped sectors 16 (i.e., eight (8) generally V-shaped sectors 16 ). Each of the plurality of generally V-shaped sectors 16 is circumferentially spaced apart from one another about a circumference of the coffee filter 10 (i.e., the generally V-shaped sectors 16 are substantially equally spaced apart from one another about the circumference of the coffee filter 10 so as to create an eight-pointed star shape in the middle of the filter 10 —see FIG. 1). Each generally V-shaped sector 16 comprises a plurality of inner fold lines 20 bounded by a pair of outer fold lines 18 . In addition, the octagonal coffee filter body 12 also includes a circular fold line 14 centrally located on the coffee filter 10 . As depicted in FIG. 1, the outer and inner fold lines 18 , 20 of each V-shaped sector 16 inwardly converge to a respective tip 22 located proximate to the circular fold line 14 (i.e., substantially disposed on the circular fold line 14 ). In one or more embodiments, each of the fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 comprises a line of weakness formed by a plurality of perforations or micro-perforations in the filter substrate or filter media material. The lines of weakness formed by the perforations or micro-perforations allow the coffee filter 10 to be easily inserted into a filter basket (e.g., filter basket 54 in FIGS. 4-7), as will be described hereinafter. For example, the lines of weakness may comprise a custom perforation pattern or a micro-perforation of 70 (i.e., a micro-perforation of 70 teeth per inch). Referring again to FIG. 1, it can be seen that the generally octagonal coffee filter body 12 of the coffee filter 10 comprises tear edges 24 on opposed sides thereof. These tear edges 24 correspond to the lines of weakness or tear perforations 26 described above in conjunction with the coffee filter roll 100 of FIG. 3. That is, each coffee filter 10 is separated from the other coffee filters 10 on the roll 100 by using the tear perforations 26 along the tear edge 24 of the coffee filter 10 . In FIG. 10, an enlarged, detailed view of the filter notches 15 , the tear perforations 26 , and the lines of weakness 18 , 20 (fold lines) for two adjacent coffee filters on the coffee filter roll 100 of FIG. 3 are illustrated. As shown in FIG. 10, the elongate slit perforations that form the tear perforations 26 between adjacent coffee filters 10 on the roll 100 are substantially larger in size than the micro-perforations that form the fold lines 18 , 20 of each coffee filter 10 . As such, the tear perforations 26 allow the coffee filters 10 disposed on the roll 100 to be easily separated from one another when a user pulls on the endmost one 10 a of the filters 10 in the roll 100 (see e.g., FIG. 3). The micro-perforations, which form the fold lines 18 , 20 of each coffee filter 10 , are designed to be sufficiently small so as to prevent coffee grounds from inadvertently passing through the filter 10 . In FIG. 8, the coffee filter 10 is illustrated in a folded state. As shown in this figure, the fold lines 18 , 20 on the side of the folded coffee filter 10 form pleats or crepes that enable the filter to generally conform to the geometry of a basket-style coffee filter basket (e.g., basket 54 , as shown in FIGS. 4-7, or basket 68 , as depicted in FIG. 9). The bottom circular fold line 14 generally conforms to the periphery of the circular bottom wall of the basket-style coffee filter basket. In an exemplary embodiment, with reference to the top view of FIG. 1, the coffee filter 10 has a first overall dimension D 1 of approximately 8.0 inches and a second overall dimension D 2 of approximately 8.0 inches. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the coffee filter 10 has an octagonal side width dimension D 3 of approximately 2.5 inches, a first notch dimension D 4 of approximately nine thirty-seconds ( 9/32) of an inch, and a second notch dimension D 5 of approximately twenty-one sixty-fourths ( 21/64) of an inch. The two sides of each substantially V-shaped notch 15 form an angle θ of approximately 125 degrees in the exemplary embodiment of the invention. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the circular fold line 14 has a radius R 1 of approximately 1.75 inches. Although, it is to be understood that the coffee filter 10 is in no way limited to these particular dimensions. Rather, other suitable dimensions may be used for the coffee filter 10 without departing from the spirit of the invention. Now, referring to FIGS. 4-7, an exemplary process by which the coffee filter 10 is inserted into a filter basket 54 of a residential-type coffee maker will be explained. The residential-type filter basket 54 includes a handle 55 for allowing a user to easily grasp the filter basket 54 . Initially, after generally aligning the coffee filter 10 above the filter basket 54 (see FIG. 4), a hand 84 of a user begins to insert the coffee filter 10 into the top of the filter basket 54 (as shown in FIG. 5), whereby the rim 53 of the filter basket 54 deforms the coffee filter 10 as a result of the fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 (e.g., micro-perforations) in the coffee filter body 12 . In FIG. 6, the coffee filter 10 has been inserted approximately halfway into the filter basket 54 by the hand 84 of the user such that the coffee filter 10 has assumed its substantially folded position, wherein the filter media contains a plurality of generally non-uniform pleats formed by the sector fold lines 18 , 20 . The circular fold line 14 is designed to substantially correspond to the circular bottom wall of the filter basket 54 . Finally, as depicted in FIG. 7, the coffee filter 10 is completely pushed down into the filter basket 54 by the hand 84 of the user until the inner circular portion of the coffee filter 10 , which is circumscribed by the circular fold line 14 , generally contacts the top surface of the circular bottom wall of the filter basket 54 . Once the coffee filter 10 has been fully inserted into the filter basket 54 , the sector fold lines 18 , 20 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 53 (refer to FIG. 7). The perspective view of FIG. 9 is similar to that of FIG. 7, except that the folded coffee filter 10 is disposed inside a commercial-type filter basket 68 (which is used with a commercial-type coffee maker), rather than in the residential-type filter basket 54 of FIGS. 4-7. Similar to the residential-type filter basket 54 described above, the commercial-type filter basket 68 includes a handle 70 and a rim 72 . It is to be understood that the process described above in conjunction with FIGS. 4-7 is equally applicable to commercial-type filter basket 68 of FIG. 9. Also, as explained above for the residential-type filter basket 54 , once the coffee filter 10 has been fully inserted into the commercial-type filter basket 68 , the sector fold lines 18 , 20 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 72 (refer to FIG. 9). The perspective view of FIG. 11 is similar to that of FIGS. 7 and 9, except that the folded coffee filter 10 is disposed inside a cone-shaped filter basket 74 , rather than in the basket-shaped filter baskets 54 , 68 of FIGS. 7 and 9. Similar to the basket-shaped filter baskets 54 , 68 described above, the cone-shaped filter basket 74 includes a rim 76 . It is to be understood that the process described above in conjunction with FIGS. 4-7 is equally applicable to cone-shaped filter basket 74 . When the coffee filter 10 is used with a cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the bottom wall of the filter 10 , which is circumscribed by circular fold line 14 , is simply pushed towards the tip 78 of the filter basket 74 until it generally deforms in accordance with the interior geometry of the cone-style filter basket 74 . Also, as explained above for basket-shaped filter baskets 54 , 68 , once the coffee filter 10 has been fully inserted into the cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the sector fold lines 18 , 20 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 76 (refer to FIG. 11). In accordance with another aspect of one or more embodiments of the present invention, the coffee filter roll 100 described above may be used in conjunction with a coffee filter dispensing system. In addition to the coffee filter roll 100 , the coffee filter dispensing system may further include a dispenser housing substantially enclosing the coffee filter roll 100 . For example, as illustrated in FIG. 12, the dispenser system may be in the form of a manual coffee filter dispenser 200 , wherein the coffee filter roll 100 is designed to be manually unrolled by a user thereof. In FIG. 12, it can be seen that the coffee filter roll 100 is contained within a dispensing housing in the form of a generally rectangular box 202 (i.e., the box 202 is generally in the form of a rectangular prism). The front of the box 202 includes an elongated aperture 204 (i.e., an elongated dispensing slot 204 ) for allowing the passage of one or more unrolled coffee filters 10 therethrough. As illustrated in FIG. 12, the width of the elongated dispensing slot 204 substantially corresponds to the width dimension of each coffee filter 10 (i.e., the elongated dispensing slot 204 is generally equal to the width dimension of each coffee filter 10 , but with an added clearance on each side of the coffee filter (e.g., ⅛ inch on each side) so that the roll outer edges do not contact the opposed ends of the slot 204 and oppose the unrolling of the coffee filter roll 100 . As additionally shown in FIG. 12, a surface of the box 202 , which houses the coffee filter roll 100 , may be provided with attachment means for attaching the dispenser box 202 to a structure in a room (e.g., the underside of kitchen cabinets, etc.). Specifically, in FIG. 12, the dispenser box 202 is provided with a plurality of adhesive strips 206 (e.g., three (3) adhesive strips 206 ) spaced apart along the top surface thereof for attaching the box 202 to a structure in a room, such as a cabinet, etc. For example, each of the adhesive strips 206 may comprise double-faced tape or another suitable type of adhesive means for removably securing the dispenser box 202 to a structure in the room. While the adhesive strips 206 are shown on the top surface of the box 202 in FIG. 12, it is to be understood that the adhesive strips 206 alternatively may be provided on other surfaces of the box 202 as well so as to accommodate a plurality of different mounting arrangements (e.g., on the bottom surface of the box 202 so that it may be adhered to a countertop or on one or more of the lateral surfaces of the box 202 ). Advantageously, the box 202 containing the coffee filter roll 100 can be stored in a drawer or cabinet, attached to the inside of a cabinet door, or mounted to the underside of a cabinet with the adhesive strips 206 . In exemplary embodiment, the box 202 has a length of approximately nine (9) inches and a cross-sectional area of approximately three (3) inches by three (3) inches. Although, it is to be understood that the box 202 is in no way limited to these particular dimensions, as the exact specifications may vary depending upon manufacturing. Other suitable dimensions may be used for the box 202 without departing from the spirit of the invention. Another example of a manual-type coffee filter dispensing system is illustrated in FIG. 13. In this figure, it can be seen that the coffee filter roll 100 is supported by a hanging device 62 attached to the underside of a cabinet 60 (e.g., a kitchen cabinet or kitchenette cabinet). As shown in FIG. 13, the hanging device 62 comprises a generally cylindrical rod 66 for accommodating the coffee filter roll 100 thereon (i.e., the cylindrical rod 66 is inserted into the central circular aperture in the coffee filter roll 100 in a similar manner in which a paper towel roll is supported). The opposed ends of the generally cylindrical rod 66 of the hanging device 62 are supported by respective end brackets 64 . The top surfaces of each end bracket 64 are attached to the bottom surface of the cabinet 60 . In order to permit an empty coffee filter roll 100 to be removed and replaced with a new coffee filter roll 100 , it is to be understood that one or more of the end brackets 64 may be detachably coupled to the rod 66 (e.g., one or more of the end brackets 64 may snap into engagement with the rod 66 , and may be designed to pivot upwardly about a rotational axis disposed proximate to its cabinet securement location so that it is capable of swinging out of the way when a new coffee filter roll 100 is being placed on the rod 66 ). As further illustrated in FIG. 13, the coffee filter roll 100 , which is rotatably supported on the hanging device 62 , is conveniently placed in close proximity to a coffee maker 50 , which utilizes the coffee filters 10 on roll 100 . The coffee maker 50 generally comprises a carafe or pot 52 for containing brewed coffee therein, a filter basket 54 that receives one of the coffee filters 10 therein, an on-off switch 56 for activating the coffee maker 50 , and a main body portion 58 that contains the primary components of the coffee maker 50 . When it is necessary to change or add a new coffee filter 10 to the coffee maker 50 , the filter basket 54 is designed to be slidingly removed from the remainder of the coffee maker 50 when a user pulls outwardly on the handle 55 of the filter basket 54 . Referring again to FIG. 13, it can be seen that a box 202 with a coffee filter roll 100 therein is disposed on the countertop next to the coffee maker 50 . Like the manual coffee filter dispenser 200 described above in conjunction with FIG. 12, the coffee filter box 202 comprises an elongated dispensing slot 204 in the lower front side thereof for allowing the passage of one or more unrolled coffee filters 10 therethrough. Although, unlike the coffee filter dispenser 200 of FIG. 12, a plurality of adhesive strips 208 (e.g., three (3) adhesive strips 208 ) are located on the bottom surface of the box 202 , rather than on the top surface of the box. In FIG. 13, the adhesive strips 208 , which are located on the bottom surface of the box 202 , allow the box to be removably attached to the top surface of the countertop so that coffee filters 10 may be easily dispensed, and torn from the roll 100 , without the box 202 undesirably sliding along the countertop surface. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the dispenser system also may be in the form of an automatic coffee filter dispenser 300 , wherein the coffee filter roll 100 is designed to be automatically unrolled by an actuator 306 disposed inside a dispensing housing 302 . Similar to the manual dispensing box 202 described above, the front of the automatic dispenser housing 302 includes an elongated aperture 304 (i.e., an elongated dispensing slot 304 ) for allowing the passage of one or more unrolled coffee filters 10 therethrough. The coffee filter roll 100 is supported on a support bracket 312 inside the dispenser housing 302 . The coffee filter roll 100 is rotatably coupled, and removably coupled to the support bracket 312 so that an empty coffee filter roll 100 is able to be removed, and replaced with a new coffee filter roll 100 . In FIG. 14, it can be seen that the automatic dispenser system 300 further includes a sensor device 308 for detecting a presence of a user (e.g., for detecting the presence of a hand of a user proximate thereto). The sensor device 308 may comprise an infrared sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, or any other suitable sensor or combination of sensors. The sensor device 308 is operatively coupled to the actuator 306 so that the coffee filter roll 100 is capable of being automatically advanced when the presence of the user is detected by the sensor device 308 (i.e., when the hand of the user is located proximate to the sensor 308 ). When the presence of the user is detected by the sensor device 308 on the front of the dispenser housing 302 , the coffee filter media on the coffee filter roll 100 is automatically advanced so that a coffee filter 10 is always accessible to a user. In particular, the coffee filter media is automatically advanced by the geared actuator rollers 306 , which are operatively coupled to a motive device inside the housing 302 , such as an electric motor. As shown in FIG. 14, the path of the coffee filter media inside the housing 302 is also regulated by the guide rollers 310 . The coffee filter media is unrolled within the housing 302 by means of its generally sandwiched arrangement between at least one of the geared actuator rollers 306 and the guide rollers 310 . Next, with reference to FIGS. 15 and 16, the structural features of a second exemplary embodiment of a coffee filter, which may be utilized on a coffee filter roll (e.g., on the coffee filter roll 100 of FIG. 3), will be explained in detail. Advantageously, the coffee filter 10 ′ of FIGS. 15 and 16 can readily be used as both a basket-type coffee filter and a cone-type coffee filter. As illustrated in the top view of FIG. 15, similar to the coffee filter 10 described above, the coffee filter 10 ′ comprises a generally octagonal coffee filter body 12 ′ with eight (8) octagonal sides. Also, like the coffee filter 10 , the octagonal sides of the coffee filter 10 ′ are spaced apart from one another by substantially V-shaped notches 15 . Although, unlike the coffee filter 10 , the coffee filter 10 ′ does not contain fold lines that are arranged together in sectors. Rather, the coffee filter 10 ′ comprises a plurality of radially extending fold lines 34 that are generally equally spaced apart from one another about a circumference of the coffee filter 10 ′. Also, it can be seen in FIG. 15 that the coffee filter 10 ′ has an inner circular fold line 28 centrally located on the coffee filter body 12 ′ thereof. In addition, the coffee filter 10 ′ further includes an outer circular fold line 30 disposed outside of the inner circular fold line 28 in a circumscribing relationship therewith. As shown in FIG. 15, the outer circular fold line 30 is generally concentric with the inner circular fold line 28 . Each of the radially extending fold lines 34 extends approximately from the outer circular fold line 30 to the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 ′. The radially extending fold lines 34 are disposed generally perpendicular to the outer circular fold line 30 . In addition, referring again to FIG. 15, it can be seen that the coffee filter body 12 ′ of the coffee filter 10 ′ also includes a middle fold line 32 extending the full width of the coffee filter 10 ′, and bisecting the coffee filter 10 ′ into two substantially equal halves. In particular, the middle fold line 32 of the coffee filter 10 ′ facilitates the insertion of the coffee filter 10 ′ into a cone-type filter basket of a coffee maker. In one or more embodiments, similar to that described above for the coffee filter 10 , each of the fold lines 28 , 30 , 32 , 34 of the coffee filter 10 ′ comprises a line of weakness formed by a plurality of perforations or micro-perforations in the filter substrate or filter media material. For example, the lines of weakness may comprise a custom perforation pattern or a micro-perforation of 70 (i.e., a micro-perforation of 70 teeth per inch). In FIG. 18, the coffee filter 10 ′ is illustrated in a folded state. As shown in this figure, the fold lines 34 on the side of the folded coffee filter 10 form pleats that enable the filter to generally conform to the geometry of either a basket-style coffee filter basket (e.g., basket 54 , as shown in FIGS. 4-7, or basket 68 , as depicted in FIG. 9) or a cone-style coffee filter basket (e.g., basket 74 , as shown in FIGS. 11 and 17). The outer circular fold line 30 generally conforms to the periphery of the circular bottom wall of the basket-style coffee filter basket. In an exemplary embodiment, with reference to the top view of FIG. 15, the coffee filter 10 ′ has a first overall dimension D 1 of approximately 8.0 inches and a second overall dimension D 2 of approximately 8.0 inches. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the coffee filter 10 ′ has an octagonal side width dimension D 3 of approximately 2.5 inches, a first notch dimension D 4 of approximately nine thirty-seconds ( 9/32) of an inch, and a second notch dimension D 5 of approximately twenty-one sixty-fourths ( 21/64) of an inch. The two sides of each substantially V-shaped notch 15 form an angle θ of approximately 125 degrees in the exemplary embodiment of the invention. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the inner circular fold line 28 has a radius R 2 of approximately 1.0 inches, while the outer circular fold line 30 has a radius R 3 of approximately 1.75 inches. Although, it is to be understood that the coffee filter 10 ′ is in no way limited to these particular dimensions. Rather, other suitable dimensions may be used for the coffee filter 10 ′ without departing from the spirit of the invention. The perspective view of FIG. 17 is similar to that of FIG. 11, except that the coffee filter 10 ′ of the second exemplary embodiment is disposed inside the cone-shaped filter basket 74 , rather than the coffee filter 10 of the first exemplary embodiment. As described above, the cone-shaped filter basket 74 includes a rim 76 and a tip 78 . It is to be understood that the process for inserting the coffee filter 10 ′ into the cone-shaped filter basket 74 of FIG. 17 is essentially the same as the process described above in conjunction with FIGS. 4-7. However, unlike the coffee filter 10 that was described in connection with FIGS. 4-7 above, the coffee filter 10 ′ includes the inner circular fold line 28 and the middle fold line 32 , which render it particularly suitable for use in a cone-shaped filter basket, such as the basket 74 depicted in FIG. 17 . When the coffee filter 10 ′ is used with a cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the generally concentric inner and outer circular fold lines 28 , 30 generally conform to the conical geometry of the basket 74 . Also, the middle fold line 32 of the coffee filter 10 ′ generally conforms to the flattened-style tip 78 of the cone-shaped basket 74 , as well as the opposed linear side portions 80 of the cone-shaped basket 74 . That is, when the coffee filter 10 ′ is in its folded-state in the cone-shaped basket 74 , the middle fold line 32 of the coffee filter 10 ′ is disposed along the interior of the flattened-style tip 78 and opposed linear side portions 80 (i.e., the middle fold line 32 is disposed within an imaginary plane bisecting the cone-shaped filter basket 74 in a longitudinal direction). Turning again to FIG. 17, similar to that explained above for the fold lines 18 , 20 of the coffee filter 10 , once the coffee filter 10 ′ has been fully inserted into the cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the radially extending fold lines 34 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 ′ is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 76 . In one or more embodiments, the filter media forming the coffee filter roll 100 , and the detachable coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ rolled therein, comprises a single-ply material. That is, the coffee filter roll 100 comprises a single, rolled layer of filter media, and each of the detachable coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ comprises a coffee filter that is completely flat when laid out in its unfolded state before being inserted into the filter basket. Unlike conventional cone-type coffee filters, the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ do not comprise adjacent, substantially parallel, multiple layers of material that form a collapsed pocket in their unfolded state. Also, unlike conventional basket-type coffee filters, the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ are not arranged in a stacked configuration when packaged. That is, each coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ is not stacked within another coffee filter in the packaged state. In one or more embodiments, the single-ply coffee filter media may comprise porous 17 pound (17#) paper with a density of approximately 64 grams per square meter (64 gsm), or 25 pound (25#) paper with a density of approximately 90 grams to 100 grams per square meter (between 90-100 gsm, inclusive). The single-ply coffee filter media may have moderate wet strength so that is does not easily tear when saturated with water after brewing the pot of coffee. Also, in one or more embodiments, the coffee filter media may be impregnated with a flavor-producing substance that adds a particular flavor to the coffee as it passes through the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ during the coffee brewing process. For example, the flavor-producing substance may comprise any flavor that is commonly used to flavor coffee, such as mocha, vanilla, French vanilla, caramel, cinnamon, Irish cream, cream and sugar, cappuccino, etc. Advantageously, when such a flavor-impregnated filter is used, the coffee will be automatically flavored during brewing process, thereby obviating the need to separately flavor the coffee after the brewing process. In addition, in one or more embodiments, the coffee filter fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 32 , 34 and tear perforations 26 are formed in the following manner. First, a continuous roll of filter material or filter media is fed between two rollers. The first roller (e.g., a top roller die or hard cylinder die) has a pattern of micro-perforation projections to form the fold lines of the filter, a pattern of slit-like projections to form the tear perforation lines 26 between filters, as well as edge cutting means to form the overall shape of the filters (e.g., octagonal shape). The second roller (e.g., a bottom roller) rotates at the same speed as the first roller die (e.g., a top roller die) and provides the firm backing/pressure that is required for the cutting die to cut into the filter media, and to form the fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 32 , 34 , tear perforations 26 , and the proper edge geometry. Then, the still continuous filter roll is fed onto cardboard rolls, where it is spun until a predetermined quantity of filters is disposed on each of the rolls. After the predetermined quantity of filters is disposed on each of the rolls, each roll is cut, and each roll is placed in its packaging (e.g., in its box). In some embodiments, the coffee filters initially may be pressed by the first and second rollers in an arrangement comprising 5-10 coffee filters in a width direction. After which, the roll comprising 5-10 coffee filters in the width direction may be sliced lengthwise so that the continuous sheets of coffee filters may be fed onto multiple rolls. In accordance with yet another aspect of one or more embodiments of the present invention, a method of dispensing rolled coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ will be described hereinafter while generally referring to the dispensing systems illustrated in FIGS. 12-14. Initially, the coffee filter roll 100 is advanced such that at least a portion of one of the plurality of coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ becomes unrolled from the coffee filter roll 100 . When a dispenser housing is provided that substantially encloses the coffee filter roll 100 , such as in the dispensing systems 200 , 300 , a portion of at least one of the plurality of coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ passes through the elongated aperture 204 , 304 in the dispenser housing 202 , 302 such that it is exposed outside the dispenser housing 202 , 302 . When the dispensing system is a manual-type dispenser, such as the dispensing system 200 in FIG. 12, the advancing of the coffee filter roll 100 is manually performed by a user pulling on the exposed end portion of the roll 100 . In contrast, when the dispensing system is a automatic-type dispenser, such as the dispensing system 300 in FIG. 14, the coffee filter roll 100 is automatically advanced by an actuating means, such as the geared actuator rollers 306 in the dispenser housing 302 . After the coffee filter roll 100 is sufficiently advanced either manually or automatically, the endmost coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ is separated from the remainder of the coffee filter roll 100 by tearing the coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ being removed from the adjacent coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ in the coffee filter roll 100 along at least one of the plurality of lines of weakness 26 (i.e., tear perforations 26 ). It is readily apparent that the aforedescribed coffee filter roll 100 , coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 , and method of dispensing rolled coffee filters offer numerous advantages. First, the coffee filter roll 100 and coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 using the same provide people with quick and convenient access to coffee filters, and ensure only one filter is used at a time. Moreover, the coffee filter roll 100 and coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 described herein protect the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ from contaminants while stored away, and they reduces the overall amount of time it takes to make coffee. Finally, the coffee filter roll 100 and coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 are ideal for use in both residential and commercial settings. Similar benefits are enjoyed by practicing the method of dispensing rolled coffee filters described herein. Any of the features or attributes of the above described embodiments and variations can be used in combination with any of the other features and attributes of the above described embodiments and variations as desired. Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to a certain embodiment or embodiments, it is apparent that this invention can be embodied in many different forms and that many other modifications and variations are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. Moreover, while exemplary embodiments have been described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the exemplary embodiments set forth above are merely illustrative in nature and should not be construed as to limit the claims in any manner. Rather, the scope of the invention is defined only by the appended claims and their equivalents, and not, by the preceding description.","9266663"

TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to the technical field of machine preparation of coffee drinks, in particular a coffee machine, a coffee bean container (coffee bean hopper) for use with said coffee machine, and a system comprising a coffee machine and a coffee bean container. BACKGROUND Coffee drinks have been consumed for a long time. The general principle is basically always the same: a coffee bean is roasted, then the roasted coffee bean is ground into ground coffee, then a liquid, usually hot water, is applied to the ground coffee. In this last step, the liquid absorbs flavors from the ground coffee and can be consumed as a coffee drink. There are various manual and machine options for preparing coffee drinks. In particular, the machines for the preparation of coffee drinks enjoy great popularity. Coffee machines can be designed according to different principles. Usually, a coffee machine contains a reservoir for ground coffee. Hot water is then fed through the ground coffee and subsequently collected in a drinking vessel. The ground coffee reservoir may be sized to hold ground coffee for one or more servings of the coffee drink. The ground coffee can either be introduced into the reservoir in ground state, or coffee beans can be ground first and immediately prior to brewing, and the resulting ground coffee is then introduced into the reservoir. The liquid is then either applied to the ground coffee under pressure or it flows through the ground coffee without pressure merely under the effect of gravity. Other coffee machines are designed to hold pre-portioned ground coffee in a variety of containers and feed hot water through these containers. A fundamental difference between the existing types of coffee machines is whether the roasted coffee beans are freshly ground before the brewing process or whether the ground coffee is already in the ground state. For a high-quality coffee drink, it can be advantageous and desirable to grind the coffee beans only immediately before the brewing process, because the ground coffee can lose flavor and aroma if left to stand for a long time. SUMMARY It can be considered an object to simplify and make more flexible the manufacturing process of coffee drinks including the grinding process of coffee beans, so that coffee drinks based on different coffee beans and with a different setting of the coffee machine can be produced in any and changing order with one coffee machine without much effort. One or more objects are solved by the embodiments described herein. According to a first aspect, a coffee machine is disclosed having a housing, a coffee bean container receiving arrangement, and a grinder. The coffee bean container receiving arrangement is configured to receive a coffee bean container. The grinder is configured to grind coffee beans. The coffee bean container receiving arrangement may include a container holder and an actuator. The container holder is configured to receive a coffee bean container. The actuator is arranged and configured to move a closing device from an open state to a closed state and vice versa. The closing device is arranged on the container holder or the coffee bean container, and the closing device is arranged to selectively close or open an inlet opening on the container holder or the coffee bean container. The actuator is further configured to move the closing device from the open state to the closed state after an adjustable period of time, thereby presetting a quantity of coffee beans to be fed to the grinder. The coffee machine further may include a detection device, which is designed to detect and read an identification of a coffee bean container. The coffee machine is designed to set the time period after which the closing device is moved from the open state to the closed state depending on the detected identification of the coffee bean container. This design allows the coffee machine to adjust the amount of coffee beans needed to make one serving of coffee. The coffee bean container is placed on or coupled to the inlet opening of the coffee bean container receiving arrangement so that coffee beans that fall out of the coffee bean container are fed to the grinder. The closing device opens and closes the inlet opening. Because the time period between the opening and closing of the inlet opening is fixed, the amount of coffee beans dropped out is predetermined or influenced thereby. In other words, the amount of coffee beans let through is determined by the length of time the inlet opening is open. The closing device can be, for example, a flap or a slide, which is guided into the inlet opening by a translatory or rotatory movement, thus preventing further coffee beans from entering the receiving space from the coffee bean container. The inlet opening can be arranged directly on the coffee bean container or on the container holder. It may be advantageous if the inlet opening together with the closing device is arranged directly on the coffee bean container. When the closing device is closed, the coffee bean container can be removed from the container holder without further coffee beans falling out of the coffee bean container towards the grinder, or generally into the coffee machine. The closing device can open the inlet opening (i.e., the opening through which coffee beans are fed from the coffee bean container into the coffee machine, i.e., the grinder or a feeder to the grinder) completely or only partially. I.e., the opening cross-section of the inlet opening is adjustable. The size of the opening cross-section can also influence the quantity of coffee beans fed in. Generally speaking, the actuator in interaction with the closing device allows to adjust the amount of coffee beans supplied per time. In addition to the time the closing device is in the open position, the size of the opening cross-section of the inlet opening can also be varied to determine the amount of coffee beans for the preparation of a coffee drink. The coffee machine has a detection device that detects and reads an identification of the coffee bean container inserted into the container holder. The identification can be a contactless readable element, for example an RFID chip. Alternatively, the identification can be an element that is read via one or more contact pins between the coffee bean container and the coffee machine. The identification contains, for example, identification data that enable the coffee machine to read out an identifier of the coffee bean container that has been inserted. Alternatively or additionally, other values can also be read from the identification. The coffee machine, for example a controller or a control unit of the coffee machine, can then be set based on the read-out identification or with the help of the read-out values. For this purpose, for example, a value for the open time of the closing device for the preparation of a coffee drink can be stored in the identification. Alternatively, the coffee machine can contain a memory which contains the values for setting the coffee machine for a specific identification value of a coffee bean container, for example a so-called look-up table. The operation of the coffee bean container identification and the reading of the identification is described here, for example, with reference to the open time of the closing device. The same principle can be applied to several other parameters of the coffee machine. Some of these parameters can be: grinding degree of the grinder, water pressure, water temperature, pressure curve, without being limited to these parameters. The coffee bean container identification is used to adjust the coffee machine to the coffee beans contained in a coffee bean container. In one embodiment, the container holder encloses a receiving space for coffee beans, and the actuator is further arranged to act on the container holder to change a size of the receiving space. The actuator is further configured, when the receiving space is filled with coffee beans, to place the closing device in the closed state and to feed the coffee beans from the receiving space to the grinder. Generally speaking, the size of the receiving space is a measure of the quantity of coffee beans used in a grinding process. The time period after which the closing device is moved from the open state to the closed state is also a measure of the quantity of coffee beans used in a grinding process. The mechanism of the variable size receiving space and the adjustable time period in which the closing device is held in the open state may alternatively and independently be implemented in a coffee machine described herein. The receiving space is located in the direction of flow of the coffee beans in the direction of the grinder downstream of the closing device. The opening and closing of the closing device controls when coffee beans are fed into the receiving space. By changing the size of the receiving space of the container holder, it is possible to determine how many coffee beans are released from the coffee bean container and used for the production of one service of coffee. By changing the size of the receiving space of the container holder, it is not necessary to close the closing device after a certain run-in time to prevent too many coffee beans from entering the receiving space. Rather, the receiving space is adjusted accordingly and then completely filled with coffee beans. An intrusion of coffee beans into the receiving space is thus automatically stopped when the receiving space is filled. Now the closing device is brought into the closed state and the coffee is ground in the correct portion. Further coffee beans can now no longer flow out of the coffee bean container. This design has another advantage. Several coffee bean containers with different coffee beans can be used with the same coffee machine. After a portion of coffee has been prepared, the closing device of the container holder is in the closed state, and there are no more coffee beans in the receiving space. The coffee bean container can now be detached from the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and another coffee bean container can be applied. Now that there are no beans from the previous operation in the coffee machine, a new operation can be started for making a portion of coffee with a different type of bean. In a coffee machine with grinder, which freshly grinds the ground coffee for a portion of coffee as needed, it is generally not possible or customary to change the coffee beans as long as there are still beans in a bean container. Changing to a different coffee bean type is thus limited to the time when the bean container has been emptied. This problem is solved in that only as many coffee beans as are needed to prepare a portion of coffee are discharged from the coffee bean container into the receiving space. The coffee bean container is then separated from the receiving space by the closing device. The coffee bean container can be detached from the coffee bean container receiving arrangement, closing the outlet opening of the coffee bean container, and another coffee bean container with a different type of coffee beans can be used. After another coffee bean container is inserted into the coffee bean container receiving arrangement, the size of the receiving space for coffee beans can be changed to use the appropriate amount of coffee beans for the desired coffee flavor or considering the characteristics of the coffee beans. In other words, the function of the coffee machine can be described as follows: the coffee machine is designed for the preparation of coffee drinks based on freshly ground coffee; the container holder with variable receiving space holds the appropriate amount of coffee beans for one serving of coffee at a time and further coffee beans are prevented from entering the receiving space; after preparation of one serving of coffee, the same coffee bean type can be used for another serving of coffee or the coffee bean container can be exchanged to prepare a coffee with a different flavor. A coffee drink can thus be prepared freshly and the same coffee machine can be operated alternately with different coffee bean types without mixing beans of different types in a significant ratio (apart from, for example, minor residues from previous operations in the grinder or other components of the coffee machine, which have no discernible influence on the coffee taste). The grinder is designed in such a way that usually no whole beans remain in the grinder after making a coffee drink. The receiving space is defined or limited by the outer wall of the container holder (lateral boundary), by a part of the coffee machine (lower boundary) and by the closing device (upper boundary). The closing device is connected to the container holder. When the actuator has transferred the closing device to the closed state, the coffee beans can be ground. Either the coffee beans are fed to the grinder separately or the coffee beans lie on the grinder and the grinder is simply activated. The actuator can also be connected to the grinder in order to adjust the grinding degree of the ground coffee by adjusting the grinding disks. For example, a distance between the grinding discs of the grinder is changed. Grinding can be performed by means of conventional disc or cone grinders. Other designs are possible, e.g., a roller grinder or a rotary piston grinder, in which the ground coffee is ground between the outer housing and an asynchronously rotating inner piston, whereby the asynchronously rotating piston can implement several grinding stages in one revolution. Nozzles for wetting the coffee beans with liquid can be arranged in the outlet volume. This can reduce or even avoid static charges during the grinding process. In addition, liquids can be used at this stage before the grinding process to influence the flavor profile. The coffee bean container may be configured in a particular manner for use with the coffee machine described herein. For example, the coffee bean container has an outlet with a closure that is opened when the coffee bean container is coupled to the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and that is automatically closed when the coffee bean container is released from the coffee bean container receiving arrangement. This keeps the beans in the coffee bean container fresh for a long period of time and prevents excessive reaction with the ambient air. Further properties and features of the coffee bean container are presented and explained in the course of this description. According to one embodiment, the actuator is arranged and configured to move the container holder translationally with respect to the housing of the coffee machine to change the size of the receiving space. Alternatively or additionally, the actuator is arranged to move a shell surface of the container holder to change the size of the receiving space. The actuator can be, for example, an electric motor, stepper motor, servomotor, which moves the container holder in or out with respect to the housing of the coffee machine, thereby changing the receiving space, i.e., the interior space of the container holder. Thus, the amount of coffee beans that can be accommodated in the receiving space can be varied. This movement of the container holder can, for example, also entrain the coffee bean container. Based on the above mentioned boundaries of the receiving space by the coffee machine, the lateral wall of the container holder and the closing device, the size of the receiving space in this example is varied in that the upper boundary of the receiving space (the container holder together with the closing device) moves with respect to the coffee machine, thus changing the size of the receiving space. Alternatively or in addition to this translational movement, a shell surface of the container holder can be manipulated, for example by an unwinding movement or a winding movement, to adjust the circumference of the container holder and thus the receiving space. The container holder can be cylindrical or sectionally funnel-shaped. In a funnel shape, a change in the diameter of one opening (the smaller opening, the larger opening, or both openings) can be made to change the size of the receiving space. A cylindrical container holder can be moved along its central axis to change the length of the cylinder, which also changes the size of the receiving space. It is conceivable that the container holder is only moved translationally in order to change the size of the receiving space. The change in the shape or geometry of the shell surface of the container holder can be made in addition to or as an alternative to the translatory movement. For example, the actuator is connected to the container holder via at least one mechanical coupling element (pressure or traction elements such as a linkage or ropes, etc.) and/or a gear so that a movement of the actuator can be transmitted to the container holder and/or the shell surface of the container holder. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a receiving cup, the receiving cup being movably connected to the container holder so that the receiving cup and the container holder can be moved relative to each other, and the receiving space for coffee beans is defined by the receiving cup, the container holder, and the closing device when in the closed state. The container holder and the receiving cup are telescopically interlocked, for example. Thus, the container holder can be moved translationally with respect to the receiving cup and thereby change the receiving space. When the coffee beans have entered the receiving space, the closing device is closed so that no further coffee beans can flow out of the coffee bean container and an outlet opening of the receiving cup is opened to guide the coffee beans out of the receiving space to the grinder. The receiving cup is optional and not mandatory to determine the amount of coffee beans. If the dead spaces in the grinder and the volume of the container holder below the closing device are known, then the receiving space can also be determined from the shape and/or position of the container holder, because the beans flowing into the receiving space are initially accumulated below by the grinding disks of the grinder. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a strainer and a tamper, and the strainer is arranged to collect ground coffee from the grinder and the tamper is arranged to apply a compressive force to the ground coffee in the strainer and to cause a homogeneous surface, distribution and thickness of the ground coffee in the strainer. The strainer can be arranged below the grinder so that the ground coffee falls directly into the strainer after grinding and is collected therein. Following the grinding process, the ground coffee is evenly distributed in the strainer by means of the tamper. The tamper may contain a plunger or a plate and is pressed onto the ground coffee in the strainer with a predetermined force. During the grinding process, the tamper is stowed in a parking position in the housing of the coffee machine. After the grinding process, the tamper is extended from the parking position and brought over the strainer. Now the tamper can be placed on the ground coffee in the strainer with a predefined force. The coffee machine can have an actuator that causes the movements of the tamper. The function of the tamper can alternatively also be fulfilled with an impeller. The impeller is located between the grinder and the sieve and rotates during the grinding process. This rotation distributes the ground coffee in the strainer. After the grinding process, the impeller is moved in the direction of the strainer and sits on the ground coffee, distributing it evenly in the strainer. It is also conceivable that the ground coffee is mixed and evenly distributed by air turbulence after the grinding process and during falling. To achieve this, however, vibrations can also be applied to the strainer as an alternative or in addition. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine is designed to be operated selectively with one coffee bean container of a plurality of exchangeable coffee bean containers. Basically, a coffee bean container placed in the container holder is in the closed state, i.e., no coffee beans fall into the grinder or the coffee machine. Coffee beans are released from the coffee bean container by opening the closing device only when required. The quantity of coffee beans released is then used to prepare a coffee drink. This means that no coffee beans remain in the grinder or in the feed to the grinder. Between the preparation of two coffee drinks, the coffee bean container can be changed, and the newly inserted coffee bean container can contain different coffee beans (different types, different degree of roasting, generally beans with a different odor and taste profile). However, it is ensured that the beans from different coffee bean containers do not mix in the coffee machine. Referring to the detection device described above, this can be an optical detection unit (e.g., a scanner) or a radio wave receiver (e.g., a so-called NFC or RFID receiver). The detection device detects either an optical identification of the coffee bean container or an electromagnetic identifier and, depending on the identifier, sets the coffee machine parameters, e.g., the time duration of the open state of the closing device or the size of the receiving space, for the coffee beans from the respective coffee bean container. If the coffee bean container is changed, the coffee machine adjusts to the new coffee bean container. For example, the detection device can read only one coffee bean container identifier and set the coffee machine parameters (size of the receiving space, flow profile of the water, temperature of the water, water pressure, etc., see also the description below) depending on this identifier, for example based on a table of setting values. The coffee bean container identifier may be, for example, a number, an alphanumeric string, or any other string that uniquely identifies a coffee bean container or the coffee beans contained in the coffee bean container to enable the coffee machine to apply the coffee machine parameter setting intended for those coffee beans. Alternatively, the coffee machine can be designed to read in a set of parameters for setting the coffee machine via the detection device. This second approach has the advantage that a separate table with setting values does not have to be kept available and that the setting values of the coffee machine can be specified completely anew with each coffee bean container, regardless of whether the existing table with setting values has an entry for a specific coffee bean container. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a water reservoir, the water reservoir comprising a housing and a piston movable therein, the piston being drivable by an actuator to move within the housing and, upon or through such movement, to force a fluid therein out of the housing through an outlet opening. The water reservoir may be designed to hold water for a single brew or portion of coffee drink. The actuator moves the piston in the water reservoir and pushes the water from the housing through the ground coffee in the strainer. Thereby the coffee drink is prepared. The actuator can cause a predetermined movement profile or flow profile of the water. For example, the flow rate per time can be specified in detail and the actuator moves the piston to achieve this flow rate. The housing can also have a water inlet for refilling the water reservoir with water after a coffee drink production process. The piston can be driven electromechanically or hydraulically. The flow rate and the flow volume of the water through the ground coffee can be specified via the path of the piston or its movement over time. The movement or position of the piston can be sensed by one or more sensors, which can be located on the piston or on the actuator. The water pressure can be determined from the mechanical load of the piston, for which a sensor can also be used. The mechanical load of the piston can be used as a manipulated variable for the pressure-flow profile, as described below. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include at least one heating element arranged at the water reservoir and configured to heat the fluid in the water reservoir to a predetermined temperature. The heating element is in particular an electrical heating element and is arranged, for example, on the walls of the housing. The heating element can also be arranged in the water reservoir, but care must be taken that the heating element does not impede the movement of the piston. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a first sensor and/or a second sensor, and the first sensor is configured to detect a flow profile of the fluid at the outlet opening of the housing of the water reservoir, and the second sensor is configured to detect a force applied by the actuator to the piston. The flow profile of the fluid forced out of the water reservoir allows conclusions to be drawn about how the fluid flows through the ground coffee in the strainer. The coffee machine has a closed fluid circuit, so that this conclusion is readily permissible. In any case, this flow profile detected by the first sensor can be compared with an expected flow profile. If the sensed flow profile deviates from the expected flow profile, a control unit can vary the actuator and the force applied to the fluid to arrive at a target flow profile of the fluid through the ground coffee. The reason for monitoring the flow profile of the fluid is that the flow profile of water through the ground coffee also affects the taste of the coffee drink. Thus, the taste of the coffee drink can be improved if the appropriate flow profile (corresponding in particular to the flow rate over time) is set. The second sensor monitors the force applied to the piston, which in turn corresponds to the water pressure. The values detected by this sensor can also be compared with a setpoint and the actuator can be controlled accordingly so that the water pressure corresponds to a pre-settable setpoint (which can be different for each type of coffee bean or for each coffee drink). The coffee machine has a control unit that is connected to the sensors and the detection device and can receive data from these sensors. Based on the data received from the sensors and the detection device for coffee bean containers, the control unit sends commands to the actuator to set the size of the receiving space (or the time period after which the closing device is moved from the open state to the closed state, i.e., in general terms, to set the amount of coffee beans or ground coffee for a single coffee drink preparation process), to the grinder to set the grind level for the coffee beans, to the water reservoir to set the temperature, the flow profile, and the water pressure. The parameters described herein can also be referred to as preparation parameters. The preparation parameters include, on the one hand, so-called brew parameters, which refer to the immediate brewing process of the coffee drink, and, on the other hand, the quantity and degree of grinding of the ground coffee. For example, the amount of ground coffee used refers to its weight, regardless of how this weight is adjusted, e.g., by the size of the receiving space for coffee beans before the grinding process or the weight of the beans or the period of time the closing device is open. The brew parameters refer to the temperature of the water or a temperature curve, the flow profile of the water (amount of water per time), and a pressure profile of the water (pressure curve over time) during the brewing process. In other words, the coffee machine is parameterized and set based on the identification of the coffee bean container. Manual adjustment of the coffee machine is no longer necessary, because the coffee machine is automatically adjusted to the parameters determined by the manufacturer or supplier of the coffee beans and recorded in the identification of the coffee bean container. A consistent taste and optimum extraction level (as the proportion of dissolved substances from the coffee bean) of the coffee drink produced in this way can thus be achieved. The control unit of the coffee machine can measure the brew parameters mentioned and record them for each individual preparation process. It may be that certain brew parameters deviate from the specification during the preparation process. If the actual prevailing brew parameters are measured (using the sensors referred to herein), a deviation from the predetermined brew parameters may be detected. For example, it may be the case that a flow profile and a pressure profile of the water deviate from the default. This may indicate that the water pressure is too high, which may result in a lower quality coffee drink as it affects the extraction of flavor. The control unit can be designed to compare the measured brew parameters with the predefined brew parameters (as specified by the identification element on the coffee bean container). In case of a deviation between measurement and default by a predetermined threshold value, the control unit can apply a correction value to the default in order to adjust the brew parameters. Such an adjustment can also be made when a user initiates an adjustment by an input at the coffee machine. In one embodiment, the coffee machine may be configured to record a pressure profile of the water during the brewing process according to a recipe. The recipe specifies, for example, a flow rate (amount of water per time). An expected pressure profile for the time during the brewing process is stored for this recipe and the specified flow rate. If the recorded pressure profile deviates from the expected pressure profile, this may indicate a need for adjustment of the specified brew parameters. In the example given here, the flow rate according to the recipe could then be increased or decreased. This adjustment can be made by the control unit of a coffee machine if the control unit detects a deviation between the recorded and expected values. In a recipe, for example, the flow rate can be specified and the pressure profile is measured and compared with an expected pressure profile. However, it is also conceivable that in a recipe the pressure profile is predetermined and the flow rate is measured and compared with an expected flow rate. The expected pressure profile or the expected flow rate from a recipe are, for example, predetermined values based on experience or based on taste sensory feedback. The expected pressure profile or flow rate are sized to correspond to a high quality coffee drink. In one embodiment, the control unit may be designed to vary the brew parameters depending on the measured pressure profile and/or flow profile. In one embodiment, the control unit may be configured to vary the brew parameters depending on coffee bean characteristics. The coffee bean properties in this sense include, for example, the origin, the roasting temperature and/or flavor attributes, which are stored on the identification element. The identification element can, for example, contain identification values for the respective coffee bean properties. The coffee machine can have an input/output unit or an operating element that enables a person to interact with the coffee machine and influence the brew parameters, among other things. The operating element can, for example, be attached to a housing of the coffee machine and be designed as a display with an input function. For example, inputs can be made via switches, buttons or rotary knobs. Alternatively, the display can be designed as a touch-sensitive display via which a person can make direct inputs. In this way, the quality of the coffee drink can be improved by training the control unit on the brew parameters and user inputs. For this purpose, the control unit uses data collected by the machine for each brewing process (the above-mentioned brew parameters, in particular the flow and pressure profiles, but possibly also the water quantity and/or temperature profiles, and optionally also the other preparation parameters such as degree of grind and coffee powder quantity). Preferably, at least the maximum brewing pressure and/or the pressure and flow rate curve (flow and pressure profiles) of the measured preparation process are used as parameters for evaluating a preparation process. In addition, the temperature curve can be determined and used. The data of the preparation process are used to readjust the initial parameters and to achieve an optimal preparation process in terms of pressure and flow curves. If, in addition, the bean properties (such as place of origin and roasting temperature, etc.) are linked to the measured brew parameters, new beans can be automatically adjusted to the best parameters by the control unit, for example by using the brew parameters of those beans whose bean properties most closely match the new beans. The sensor data determined by the machine serve as the basis for training the control unit. The control unit can be designed to output predictions of the flavor profiles of the brewed coffee based on the growing conditions, growing region and planned processing of the coffee beans. Feedback from the user about the taste of the coffee can be used to link the bean characteristics to specific taste sensory characteristics. An algorithm trained on this data can make a prediction about the taste of the coffee based only on the bean characteristics (growing region, roasting temperature, etc.). Input parameters for this function are at least one bean property (which can be read from the identification of the coffee bean container) and the necessary measurement parameter is the user input about the taste sensory perception. The control unit can adapt existing recipes (i.e., the preparation parameters) to a desired taste of a user. The control unit can also make a prediction or recommendation of coffee beans or their origin or processing, based on a taste profile of the user. For this purpose, the control unit compares the input about the taste sensory perception of the user with the bean characteristics of the beans used and estimates in which direction the user has changed the taste by the input. Through this estimation, the control unit can determine which beans have an appropriate flavor profile and then recommend those beans for consumption. Following a similar mechanism, the control unit can recommend beans of a particular growing region or processing. According to another aspect, an arrangement comprising a plurality of coffee machines described herein is disclosed. The plurality of coffee machines are communicatively connected to a central unit such that the coffee machines can transmit data to or receive data from the central unit. For example, the coffee machines are connected to the central unit via a data network or data link. A memory with recipes can be kept in the central unit, with the recipes each containing the preparation parameters for a specific type of bean. In this way, it is possible to supply the coffee machines centrally with the recipes. Conversely, it is also possible for the coffee machines to transmit the measured values recorded by the sensors and belonging to a specific bean type (in particular the brew parameters) to the central unit. In this way, the central unit can evaluate whether or not the specified brew parameters match the specific bean type. If it is determined that the specified brew parameters cause an undesirable behavior (an unsuitable flow profile or an unsuitable pressure curve), the recipe for the specific bean type can be changed and distributed to the coffee machines. The central unit can adjust the brew parameters in the same way as the local control unit, whereby the central unit uses measured values from a plurality of coffee machines. The measured values recorded by the sensors of the multiple coffee machines are transmitted to the central unit. In the central unit, the recorded measured values are then compared with the expected values for the respective parameter as assigned to a recipe (pressure profile of the water or flow rate of the water). If there is a discrepancy between the measured values and the expected values, the corresponding recipe can be adjusted in the central unit and communicated to the coffee machines, so that with the adjusted recipe the measured values correspond to the expected values. The basic idea here is that the control unit in the coffee machines regulates a manipulated variable as specified in the recipe (for example, the flow rate of the water in a first case or the pressure profile of the water in a second case) and that sensors in the coffee machines measure a test variable (for example, the pressure profile of the water in the first case or the flow rate of the water in the second case). The measured test variable is compared to an expected value for the test variable, and if there is a discrepancy, the recipe and its default manipulated variable are adjusted. This process may be implemented locally in each coffee machine using the locally measured values or the process may be implemented in the central unit using the measured values of a plurality of coffee machines. According to another aspect, a coffee bean container is disclosed. The coffee bean container may include a housing, an outlet and an identification element. The housing is configured to receive coffee beans. The outlet is arranged to discharge coffee beans from the housing. The identification element is machine readable and contains an instruction for setting parameters of a coffee machine for preparing a coffee drink with the coffee beans from the housing. The identification element is configured to preset a first parameter of the coffee machine, and the first parameter is configured to instruct an actuator to move a closing device on a container holder of the coffee machine or on the coffee bean container from an open state to a closed state and vice versa and to move the closing device from the open state to the closed state after an adjustable period of time, thereby presetting a quantity of coffee beans to be fed to the grinder. The coffee bean container is configured to interact with the coffee machine described herein. The identification element is optically or electromagnetically readable as described in connection with the coffee machine. The coffee bean container thus includes a prescription for setting the coffee machine to produce a coffee drink with the coffee beans contained therein. The identification element can be a character string, as described above, which acts as an identifier and enables the coffee machine to apply the setting parameters assigned to this character string. Alternatively, the identification element can contain the setting parameters. The outlet of the coffee bean container is configured to be coupled to the coffee bean container receiving arrangement or the container holder of the coffee machine. According to a further embodiment, the coffee bean container further may include a locking element arranged to releasably lock the outlet to a container holder of a coffee machine. The locking element can be designed as a pin, hook, or eye, for example. The locking element interacts with a counterpart on the container holder and serves to lock the coffee bean container to the container holder of the coffee machine. This locking can be made and released without tools, for example by placing the coffee bean container on the container holder in such a way that the locking element engages in a locking groove of the container holder. From this position, the coffee bean container can be rotated or locked into a locked position. According to a further embodiment, the coffee bean container further may include a closure, and the closure is arranged to selectively open or close the outlet of the coffee bean container, and the closure is arranged to transition from a closed state to an open state when the coffee bean container is connected to a container holder of a coffee machine. When the coffee bean container is not inserted in the coffee machine, the closure closes the housing and protects the coffee beans contained therein. When the coffee bean container is inserted into the coffee machine, the closure is moved to the open position and allows the coffee beans to enter the receiving space of the container holder when its closing device is also in the open state. When the coffee bean container is removed from the container holder, the closure of the coffee bean container is placed in the closed state. The closure can be designed, for example, as a central closure or lamella closure, in which closure plates are pushed radially in front of the outlet opening of the coffee bean container and thus close it. When the coffee bean container is inserted into the container holder of the coffee machine, the outlet opening of the coffee bean container is released by the closure opening during this insertion movement. In this state, no coffee beans enter the receiving space. After the coffee bean container has been inserted into the container holder, the coffee machine recognizes this and reads the identification of the coffee bean container. The coffee machine is then set according to the transferred parameters. Now, a coffee drink can be prepared. First, the closing device of the container holder opens, lets coffee beans into the receiving space, closes the receiving space with the locking device and then prepares the coffee drink as described above. Now, the coffee bean container can be changed (causing a new coffee machine setting procedure; in general, the parameters are applied to the coffee machine when a coffee bean container is inserted into the container holder) or another coffee drink can be prepared with the same coffee bean container. According to a further aspect, a system for preparing coffee drinks is disclosed. The system may include one or more coffee bean containers as described herein and a coffee machine as described herein. The system enables the coffee machine to be used for the fresh preparation of coffee drinks based on freshly ground coffee beans with several different coffee bean containers (and different coffee beans or types of coffee beans contained therein), whereby the coffee bean containers can be inserted selectively, and the coffee machine parameterizes itself depending on the parameterization specifications on the identification element of the coffee bean container. In general, it is conceivable in connection with the coffee machine and the system that a user of the coffee machine deviates from the predefined parameters for setting the coffee machine. Although the coffee machine sets these parameters, a user may permanently or temporarily change the predetermined parameters for a particular type of coffee and thus, for example, train (parameterize) for a new type of coffee bean. For this purpose, the coffee machine may include a data memory that stores the user-specific parameterization for a particular identifier of a coffee bean container. When the coffee machine reads this identifier from the identification element, the parameters from the data memory can then be applied directly. For this purpose, this data memory can optionally be arranged in a decentralized manner, in which case the data memory can be accessed via a data network. Such a central data memory can be updated from a central location, for example by centrally adjusting the parameters to a particular coffee bean variety, for example by changing existing parameters to a coffee bean variety or offering a parameter set to a new coffee bean variety. The central data memory can be contacted and read out each time the coffee machine parameters are adjusted, in order to apply the read-out parameters to the respective coffee machine in a decentralized manner, or the data memory can serve as a source for distributing updated parameters to the coffee machines, so that the parameters are kept in the coffee machines in a decentralized manner after the update process. Furthermore, the coffee bean container can be hermetically sealed with the container holder so that the coffee beans are kept in as inert an atmosphere as possible when the coffee bean container is inserted into the container holder. Of course, the coffee bean container can be detached from the container holder after each preparation of a coffee drink, whereby the closure closes the outlet opening of the coffee bean container and thus protects the coffee beans. Several such systems can be connected to each other via a data network (e.g., via the Internet or a private data network) and transmit information about the coffee machines' parameters to a central data repository. This allows alternative parameters for a coffee bean type to be transmitted, allowing other users to use the same parameter set. In the following, a coffee machine or parts thereof are described according to further aspects. Each aspect includes several variants, and references from one variant to another variant are to be understood as referring to variants of the same aspect. Aspect 2—Strainer for Coffee Machine and Coffee Machine with Strainer Aspect 2, initial variant (variant 0): a strainer for a coffee machine, for example a so-called portafilter machine, the strainer comprising a first coating arranged to provide thermal insulation between the strainer and a strainer support of the coffee machine. The coffee machine according to aspect 2, initial variant may be a coffee machine as described herein. However, the coffee machine may also be a machine that does not have, or only partially has, the other features described herein. In other words, such a strainer may be used in any portafilter machine for preparing hot beverages, such as coffee drinks. For example, the grinder, the closing device on the container holder or the coffee bean container along with associated actuator, and the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and the coffee bean container may be omitted for the functions described in aspect 2. In aspect 2, the detection device can also be omitted. The strainer support is an element that holds or supports the strainer in its predetermined position. Aspect 2, Variant 1: the strainer according to the initial variant, in which the first coating is disposed on an outer surface of the strainer. A strainer can be described in general terms as a container and has, for example, a substantially U-shaped profile. This container has a base area and an interior space as well as lateral walls. In the base area there are openings which allow the function of a strainer. In the case of coffee drink preparation, the strainer contains ground coffee through which hot water is forced. The water absorbs substances from the ground coffee and flows through the openings in the base area of the strainer into a vessel. Aspect 2, Variant 2: the strainer according to the initial variant or Variant 1, in which the first coating covers or overlies a portion or all of the outer surface of the strainer. The strainer is usually held by a support. The support can also be referred to as the strainer support. The first coating may be arranged on the strainer in such a way that the transfer of thermal energy from the strainer to the support is reduced. It is conceivable that the first coating is arranged on the strainer in such a way that the first coating on the outer surface is only arranged at those points or surfaces where the strainer is in contact (i.e., in mechanical contact) with the support. Then the first coating ensures that the flow of thermal energy (i.e., thermal conduction) between the strainer and the support is reduced at precisely these points. Alternatively, the entire outer surface of the strainer can be coated with the thermally insulating first coating. The outer surface of the strainer is in particular that surface which runs along one or more lateral walls and/or a shoulder of the strainer and faces away from the interior space of the strainer. The outer surface of the lateral walls and/or a shoulder, which holds the strainer on the support, are usually in mechanical contact with the support at least in sections. The thermally insulating first coating at these positions ensures that the outflow of thermal energy from the strainer to the support is reduced. In one variant, the strainer can also have a thermally insulating coating on the entire outer surface, i.e., also where the outer surface of the strainer is not in mechanical contact with the support or another element of the coffee machine. By thermally insulating the strainer also on those sections of the outer surface that are only in contact with the ambient air, a loss of thermal energy through convection can also be reduced. For example, the base area of the strainer on the side facing away from the interior space can also be coated with the first coating. The first coating on the entire or partial outer surface of the strainer helps to reduce the dissipation of thermal energy from the strainer. It is also conceivable that a ceramic coating is applied to an interior surface of the strainer, such as to the entire interior surface. The strainer may, for example, consist of a metallic base material provided with the first coating. This has the advantage of improving the energy efficiency of the coffee machine without negatively affecting the quality of the prepared beverage. An important point for the quality of prepared coffee drinks is, among other things, the temperature stability of the water during the preparation of the coffee drink, especially while the water is in contact with the ground coffee. This temperature stability can be realized on the one hand by a high thermal mass of the strainer and the support in contact with it, which are preheated to an appropriate temperature and kept at this temperature. In order to reduce the energy required for heating the strainer and the support, it is proposed in this aspect that the strainer is thermally isolated from the support to reduce the energy required while still maintaining a constant brewing temperature of the water. This thermal insulation can be realized, for example, by a ceramic first coating of the strainer. The insulation reduces the thermal mass, which should have a constant temperature, to that of the strainer. The support is thermally separated or isolated from the strainer. Aspect 2, Variant 3: the strainer according to any of the previous variants of aspect 2, in which the first coating is a ceramic coating. Ceramic is an inorganic non-metallic material and has low thermal conductivity combined with high mechanical strength. For example, aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) can be used. The thickness of the first coating can be varied depending on the application and expected temperature differences between the strainer and the support. For example, the first coating can be a few tenths of a millimeter up to one millimeter thick. Aspect 2, Variant 4: The strainer according to any of the preceding variants of aspect 2, further comprising a second coating, in which the second coating covers or overlays a portion or all of an interior surface of the screen. The second coating may have non-stick properties. This has the advantage that the ground coffee does not adhere to the strainer or its interior surface after preparation of a coffee drink or detaches more easily therefrom. The second coating may contain or consist of a fluoropolymer, for example polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). However, the second coating can also be based on ceramics (i.e., contain or consist of ceramics) and have a smooth surface, which also provides good anti-adhesion properties. Aspect 2, Variant 5: a coffee machine having a strainer support and having a strainer according to any of the previous variants of Aspect 2. The strainer is detachable from the strainer support. When the strainer is removed from the strainer support, the interior space of the strainer can be filled with ground coffee. After the ground coffee has been prepared for the preparation of a coffee drink, the strainer is inserted into the strainer support and the preparation process is started. For the purpose of this variant, strainer support means any holder for holding the strainer during a preparation process of a coffee drink or other hot beverage. Aspect 2, Variant 6: The coffee machine of Variant 5, in which a holding surface of the strainer support may include a thermally insulating coating. This thermally insulating coating can be of the same type as the coating on the outer surface of the strainer. The strainer support may be coated with the first coating on those surfaces that are in mechanical contact with the strainer. The strainer can contact the strainer support in the inserted state at one or more surfaces or punctually at several points. At these contact points or contact surfaces, the strainer and optionally the strainer support is coated with the thermally insulating first coating. The first coating on the strainer and optionally on the strainer support reduces the thermal flow from the strainer to the strainer support. Aspect 3—Networked Intelligent Coffee Machine Aspect 3, initial variant (variant 0): a coffee machine with a control unit and at least one sensor, in which the sensor is configured to detect a brew parameter during the preparation of a coffee drink and to transmit it to the control unit, and the control unit is configured to modify a recipe for the preparation of a coffee drink based on the detected brew parameter. With regard to the function of the control unit and the at least one sensor as well as the definition of the brew parameters, reference is made to the above description, in particular to the explanations regarding the manipulated variable and the test variable as well as to the adaptation of the recipe in case of deviations between a value of the measured test variable and a value of the expected test variable. The coffee machine may comprise more than one sensor. The control unit is designed to modify the parameters contained in the recipe for the preparation of a coffee drink based on the detected brew parameters (for example flow profile, pressure curve, etc.) if the detected brew parameters indicate a lower quality of the coffee drink. Aspect 3, Variant 1: the coffee machine according to the initial variant, the coffee machine may include an input/output unit configured to receive an input from a user. The user's input concerns, for example, taste sensory parameters of a prepared coffee drink. The taste sensory parameters are transmitted to the control unit. The control unit is designed to use the taste sensory parameters to vary the brew parameters of a recipe. Aspect 3, Variant 2: The coffee machine according to any one of the previous variants, further comprising an interface for establishing a connection to a data network, and the coffee machine is adapted to be communicatively connected to a central unit such that the coffee machine can send data to and/or receive data from the central unit. For example, the interface can be designed to establish a wireless connection (e.g., WiFi, IEEE 802.11 protocol family) to an access point of a data network. However, the interface can also be designed for a wired connection (Ethernet or other standards). The coffee machine is usually connected indirectly to the central unit via this interface, i.e., the connection between the coffee machine and the central unit is established via an intermediate data network. For the variants of aspect 3, reference is made to the corresponding description elsewhere in this document with respect to the sensors and the brew parameters. The brew parameters specified in a recipe and the brew parameters measured by the sensors are also used in aspect 3 as they are reproduced elsewhere in this description. Aspect 3, Variant 3: an arrangement comprising a plurality of coffee machines according to any one of the preceding variants and at least one central unit, in which each one of the plurality of coffee machines is connected to a central unit such that data can be exchanged between the respective coffee machine and the central unit in at least one direction. It is conceivable that some coffee machines only send data in the direction of the central unit, but do not receive any data. Conversely, it is also conceivable that some coffee machines do not send any data in the direction of the central unit, but only receive or retrieve data from the central unit. The data exchange between the coffee machine and the central unit can, for example, be a setting option specified by a user of the coffee machine. The data exchange between a coffee machine and the central unit can be based on a so-called push or pull mechanism, i.e., the data sink retrieves data (pull) or the data source sends data on its own (push). The input device of a coffee machine can be designed in such a way that a user can order accessories or coffee beans by means of the input device via a predefined input mask. For this purpose, the coffee machine may suggest to the user a bean type that corresponds to the taste sensory profiles preferred by this user. In the central unit, the transmitted measured brew parameters can be used to adjust a recipe of a specific bean type. This can be helpful, for example, if it is determined for a recipe that the specified brew parameters lead to an undesirable time curve of the measured brew parameters. In aspect 3, the coffee machine may be a coffee machine according to any of the other aspects described herein. However, it may also be a coffee machine with a different range of functions. For example, the grinder, the closing device on the container holder or the coffee bean container including the associated actuator, the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and the coffee bean container may be omitted for the functions described in aspect 3. Optionally, the detection device may also be omitted if a recipe with the predetermined brew parameters for the preparation of a coffee drink is selected in another way, for example via the input device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a system 10 comprising a coffee bean container 100 and a coffee machine 200 . The coffee bean container 100 may include a housing 110 , an outlet 120 with a closure 125 and a locking element 127 , and an identification element 130 . The coffee machine 200 may include a housing 210 , a control unit 220 , a grinder 230 and a coffee bean container receiving arrangement 240 . Furthermore, the coffee machine 200 may include a detection device 205 . In this example, the detection device 205 is arranged at the housing 210 . In particular, the detection device 205 is positioned to read the identification element 130 of the coffee bean container 100 when the coffee bean container 100 is coupled to the coffee bean container receiving arrangement 240 . The grinder 230 may include one or more grinding disks 232 . Between the grinding disks 232 there is a free space 234 into which the coffee beans are inserted before the grinding process begins. The grinder 230 is adjustable via an actuator, for example via the actuator 245 , by varying the distance between the grinding disks 232 . The coffee bean container receiving arrangement 240 includes a container holder 241 and a receiving cup 244 . The container holder 241 is movable relative to the receiving cup 244 , for example, by the actuator 245 moving the container holder 241 up or down. This movement varies the size of the receiving space 246 , which is the interior space of the container holder 241 and receiving cup 244 . The container holder 241 has a locking groove 242 . The coffee bean container 100 is placed on the container holder 241 with the outlet 120 so that the locking element 127 engages in the locking groove 242 . The coffee bean container 100 is then rotated to a locked position. During this rotational movement, the closure 125 of the outlet 120 is opened so that coffee beans can pass from the coffee bean container 100 into the receiving space 246 . With respect to the coffee bean container 100 , it is conceivable that the housing 110 is rotatable with respect to the outlet 120 to open the closure 125 upon this relative movement between the housing 110 and the outlet 120 . When the coffee bean container 100 is coupled to the container holder 241 , there is first a first rotational movement that locks the locking element 127 in the locking groove 242 . Subsequently, the housing 110 of the coffee bean container 100 may be rotated in the same direction, and during this subsequent rotational movement, a portion of the outlet 120 is no longer rotated, such that this second movement opens the closure 125 of the outlet 120 . However, the closure 125 can also be opened in other ways, for example by a lever or other opening element arranged on the housing 110 . Removing the coffee bean container 100 performs these steps in reverse order: first, the housing 110 is rotated with respect to the outlet 120 to close the outlet 120 with the closure 125 , then the locking element 127 in the locking groove 242 is released and the coffee bean container 100 can be removed. The container holder 241 may include a closing device 243 . The closing device 243 opens or closes the access to the receiving space 246 . The closing device 243 is actuated by the actuator 245 . The receiving space 246 is filled with coffee beans in a quantity that is intended for preparing a portion of a coffee drink. For this purpose, the actuator 245 adjusts the size of the receiving space 246 , in the example of FIG. 1 by moving the container holder 241 up or down. Then, the closing device 243 is moved, for example by a lateral sliding movement, and coffee beans enter the receiving space 246 . The amount of coffee beans in the receiving space 246 is limited by the receiving space 246 being full. Then, the closing device 243 is moved to the closed position. Subsequently, the coffee beans are fed from the receiving space 246 to the grinder 230 , for example, by releasing an outlet opening 247 of the receiving cup 244 . The outlet opening 247 can be selectively opened or closed with a closing device (not shown, similar to the closing device 243 at the inlet of the receiving space 246 ). Since the closing device 243 is in the closed position, no further coffee beans flow through the inlet opening 248 into the receiving space 246 or the grinder 230 and the coffee beans are portioned for this brewing operation as specified. Once all coffee beans have been ground, outlet opening 247 is closed again and the process for making a coffee drink can be repeated. The receiving cup 244 may also be omitted. Without the receiving cup 244 , the receiving space 246 of the container holder 241 is extended by a free space 234 in the grinder 230 . When the closing device 243 is opened, coffee beans flow into the receiving space 246 and the free space 234 . Provided that the free space 234 and its size are known, the size of the receiving space 246 can be adjusted by moving the container holder 241 . Before the next coffee drink is produced, the coffee bean container 100 can be changed. If a coffee bean container 100 with a different coffee bean type is used, the coffee machine 200 detects the identification element 130 of the new coffee bean container 100 by means of the detection device 205 and sets the coffee machine to the new coffee bean type. In summary, FIG. 1 describes a coffee machine 200 , a coffee bean container 100 , and a system 10 comprising a coffee machine 200 and a coffee bean container 100 . The coffee bean container 100 includes an identification element 130 that is read by the coffee machine 200 when the coffee bean container 100 is placed on the coffee machine 200 . Based on the information read out from the identification element 130 , a set of parameters (the so-called preparation parameters) is applied to the coffee machine and the coffee machine is individually set for the placed coffee bean container. Various actuators are provided which can set the following parameters: amount of coffee beans (by setting the size of the receiving space with a corresponding actuator), grinding degree (by setting the grinder), flow profile, pressure, amount of water (by controlling the actuator of the water reservoir), temperature of the water (controlling the heating element on the water reservoir). The settings are applied by the control unit 220 of the coffee machine by transmitting corresponding setting commands from the control unit 220 to the respective actuators or the heating elements. Although FIG. 1 shows a container holder 241 with a closing device 243 , the closing device 243 may also be part of the coffee bean container. The closing device can be a flap or a slider at the outlet opening of the coffee bean container. An actuator of the coffee machine including a lever or linkage may act on the closing device and thereby release said opening of the coffee bean container so that coffee beans fall by gravity from the coffee bean container into the grinder or a feed to the grinder. The design of the coffee bean container 100 and the coffee machine 200 described here is characterized in particular by the fact that the coffee bean container 100 can be changed after each preparation process of a portion of coffee drink and that no unground coffee beans of the previous coffee bean type are in the grinder. The coffee machine 200 makes it possible to prepare coffee drinks based on freshly ground coffee and still change the coffee bean type after each individual production process of a portion of coffee drink. The control unit 220 may be a programmed controller connected to the detection device 205 and the actuator 245 . The control unit 220 receives information from the detection device 205 about the identification 130 of the coffee bean container 100 and, based on this information, generates control commands that instruct the actuator 245 to adjust the coffee machine 200 accordingly. The actuator 245 is shown by way of example only. It is to be understood that the coffee machine may include one or more actuators 245 , each actuator arranged to set a parameter of the coffee machine or to perform a function. The functions to be performed are: moving the closing device 243 from the open state to the closed state and vice versa; the same function is also implemented for releasing or closing the outlet opening 247 ; adjusting the grinding degree of the grinder 230 ; varying the size of the receiving space 246 . Further functions are described with reference to the following figures and are mentioned here only for completeness: distributing and compacting ground coffee in a strainer; dispensing water from a water reservoir; heating water in the water reservoir. The control unit 220 is configured to instruct one or more actuators to execute the above functions according to a specification corresponding to the identification of a coffee bean container to adjust the coffee machine as specified. FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the coffee machine 200 with housing 210 , grinder 230 , tamper 250 and strainer 260 . When the coffee beans are ground in the grinder 230 , the resulting ground coffee falls onto the strainer 260 . In this state, the ground coffee may be unevenly distributed in the strainer. The tamper 250 is now used to evenly distribute and compact the ground coffee in the strainer. The tamper 250 may be positioned in a recess of the housing 210 during the grinding process, and is extended from this recess and returned to its position above the strainer 260 when the grinding process is complete. The tamper 260 may be a planar piston or an impeller. The tamper 260 exerts a force on and distributes ground coffee located in the strainer 270 . Now a heated fluid, for example water, can be forced through the ground coffee in the strainer 260 . FIG. 3 shows a water reservoir 270 with a housing 271 in which water 276 is stored. A piston 273 is arranged in the housing, which can be moved in the housing by an actuator 275 and a rod 274 . When the piston 273 is moved in the housing 271 , the water 276 is forced through the outlet opening 277 . A hose or pipe (not shown) is arranged at the outlet opening 277 and brings the water to the ground coffee in the strainer 260 (see FIG. 2 ). The actuator 275 is also controlled by the control unit 220 to cause a desired flow profile and pressure of the water 276 through the outlet opening 277 . The flow profile of the water and the pressure of the water is determined by the identification of the coffee bean container used. Heating elements 272 are arranged at the water reservoir 270 to bring the water 276 to a desired temperature. This temperature can also be specified by the identification of the coffee bean container used. For example, the water reservoir 270 has a holding capacity for water to make one serving of coffee drink. After the manufacturing process, the piston 273 is pulled away from the outlet opening 277 by the actuator 275 . At this point, new water is introduced into the water reservoir 270 , for example via an inlet opening (not shown separately) arranged in the wall of the housing 271 . FIG. 4 shows the control unit 220 and a first sensor 280 and a second sensor 290 associated therewith. The first sensor 280 may be arranged on the coffee machine 200 to sense a flow profile of water forced out of the water reservoir 270 . The second sensor 290 may be arranged on the piston 273 or the actuator 275 to sense a movement or resistance of the piston 273 or the actuator 275 , respectively. Both the flow profile of the water and the resistance to movement of the piston 273 or actuator 275 can be used by the control unit 220 to determine how the water flows through the ground coffee contained in the strainer 260 . The flow profile and the pressure of the water affect the taste of the coffee drink. Both may be predetermined for the particular coffee bean container 100 via the identification element 130 on the coffee bean container 100 . If the flow profile and/or the pressure of the water deviates from these specifications, the control unit 220 can control the actuator 275 at the water reservoir 270 in such a way that these values adapt to the specifications. FIG. 5 shows a coffee machine 200 A. This can be the coffee machine from the preceding embodiments or a coffee machine that does not implement or only partially implements the features described in FIGS. 1 to 4 . The coffee machine 200 A includes a support 252 . The support 252 has an opening configured to receive the strainer 260 to enable preparation of a coffee drink. In the state shown in FIG. 5 , the strainer at 160 is located in the support 252 . In this state, heated or hot water is forced through ground coffee (not shown) located in the interior space 262 . The water exits the interior space 262 through openings located in the base area 261 of the strainer 260 (not shown). The strainer 260 has a substantially U-shaped profile with a base area 261 , one or more lateral walls 265 , and one or more shoulders 266 . The lateral walls 265 together with the base area 261 form the interior space 262 . The shoulder 266 rests on the support 252 in the inserted state and holds the strainer 260 in position. In the example shown in FIG. 5 , various surfaces of the strainer 260 abut the support 252 . To reduce the amount of thermal energy transferred from the strainer to the support, an outer surface 263 of the lateral wall 265 is coated with a first coating 264 . The first coating 264 is configured to be thermally insulating. For example, the first coating 264 is disposed on the outer surface of the lateral wall and on the underside of the shoulder. Generally speaking, the first coating 264 is disposed at the contact surfaces or contact points between the strainer 260 and the support 252 . The interior surface 267 of the screen 260 is coated with a second coating 268 . The second coating serves to prevent adhesion of ground coffee after the preparation process of a coffee drink or to reduce the extent thereof. The second coating 267 is arranged, for example, on the interior surface of the lateral wall 265 and on the base area 261 , and in particular extends over the entire interior surface of the strainer 260 . The second coating 267 may also extend to the surface of the shoulder 266 . FIG. 6 shows an arrangement 1 with a plurality of coffee machines 200 B and a central unit 5 . The coffee machines 200 B are communicatively connected to the central unit 5 via a data network or a data link, so that data can be exchanged bidirectionally between each individual coffee machine and the central unit. For example, a coffee machine from a household may be connected wireless or in a wired manner to an access node to the Internet (or another data network). The Internet (or another data network) establishes the connection to the remotely located central unit 5 . The central unit 5 may provide selected individual or all coffee machines with information, such as new recipes or changes to existing recipes. The central unit 5 may, for example, be designed as a computer or a computer arrangement to have sufficient computing power and transmission capacity to handle a connection to a high number of coffee machines. Each coffee machine 200 B has a control unit 220 which, on the one hand, applies the preparation parameters for a coffee drink and, on the other hand, receives measured values from a plurality of sensors distributed in the coffee machine (for example, the first sensor 280 and the second sensor 290 as well as further sensors as described herein), and the measured values in particular relate to the brew parameters. In addition, each coffee machine 200 B includes an input/output unit or operating element 225 through which a user of the coffee machine can provide taste sensing input to a prepared coffee drink. The control unit 220 receives both the measured values and the taste sensor inputs and transmits them to the central unit 5 . The central unit 5 can also be configured to provide the preparation parameters to a coffee machine based on a read-out identification element 130 of the coffee bean container. For example, if a coffee bean container 100 is inserted into the coffee machine 200 B and the identification element is read out, the coffee machine can retrieve the recipe with preparation parameters belonging to this identification element from the central unit 5 . This means that it is not necessary for the recipe to be stored locally on the identification element or in the coffee machine. If the recipe is stored centrally and is retrieved as needed, a revision of the recipe will find its way to the individual coffee machines at an early stage. For example, the recipe can be retrieved by a coffee machine from the central unit whenever a coffee bean container is newly inserted or changed in said coffee machine. It is conceivable that the coffee machine has a memory which holds a fixed or variable number of most recently used recipes, whereby a recipe stored in this memory is provided with a time stamp, for example, and is deleted after a predeterminable period of time. However, a recipe can also be deleted from the memory if there is a need for storage space for more recently used recipes. Additionally, it should be noted that “comprising” or “consisting” does not exclude other elements or steps, and “one” or “a” does not exclude a plurality. It should further be noted that features or steps that have been described with reference to any of the above embodiments may also be used in combination with other features or steps of other embodiments described above. Reference signs in the claims are not to be regarded as a limitation.

The compositions of the invention comprise processed coffee grounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The art includes numerous methods directed toward enhancing the flavor of instant coffee, brewed coffee and coffee extracts. With respect to brewed coffee and coffee extracts, these methods typically attempt to achieve this goal without sacrificing the desirable yields and conveniences associated with conventional high temperature (generally at least about 65° C. (149° F.)) coffee extraction. It is generally recognized that high temperature coffee extraction is convenient and economical to the end user, but that flavor is often compromised. That is, end users (both at home consumers and those in an industrial setting) prefer the convenience of conventional brewing appliances, which use high temperature extraction. It follows, then, that to be of appeal to consumers or to industry, methods of enhancing flavor must do so without sacrificing convenience. Additionally, the methods must provide these attributes while being economical to the end user. Selective extraction is one general approach to improving the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extract. According to this approach, a preferred ratio of bad to good coffee flavors are extracted from roasted and ground coffee. Ideally, this selective extraction improves the overall flavor of brewed coffees or coffee extracts without compromising its flavor strength or extraction yield. Two well known selective extraction methods are low temperature extraction and selective extraction via adsorbents. Although both methods are known to improve coffee flavor, it is also recognized that each method has serious deficiencies. For example, low temperature extraction generally provides lower yields than high temperature extraction. Unlike low temperature extraction, adsorbents accommodate high temperature conditions and also preferably adsorb a favorable ratio of bad flavor components to good flavor components without sacrificing yield and convenience. Adsorbents used in roasted and ground coffee include activated carbons (i.e., activated charcoals), carbohydrates and carbohydrate polymers (e.g., alginic acid), synthetic polyamides, insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, certain mineral substances (e.g. aluminum oxides, silica gel), amidated cellulose materials (e.g., chitosan, chitan), and proteinaceous materials (e.g. gelatin, zein). These prior art adsorbents have been used in various ways to improve the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extracts. Some have been added to extraction columns in industry, to the extract from extraction columns, to packaged roasted and ground coffee marketed for consumer use, or to the structure of coffee filters used in conventional brewing devices. These adsorbents improve the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extract by either adsorbing (and therefore removing) a favorable ratio of bad flavor components to good flavor components, or by adsorbing good flavor components during storage and releasing them upon extraction. In spite of the flavor improvements, adsorbents described in the prior art are typically expensive and may pass into the final coffee beverage, thereby providing negative mouth feel character. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,708, Rizzi et al. describe a process for removing lipids from spent coffee grounds so they comprise less than 2% lipids, whereupon they are suitable for use as an adsorbent for bitter coffee flavors and burnt coffee aromas. The removal of lipids is accomplished via organic solvent extraction using lipophilic solvents, such as ethanol, methanol, chloroform, hexane and ethyl acetate. Although this method is known to improve coffee flavor, it is also recognized that the method has deficiencies. For example, it is well recognized in the industry that the use of organic solvent systems is not only very capital intensive, but can be problematic when dealing with solvent reclamation, safety, and environmental issues. These problems can be further compounded when dealing with multiple solvent systems. Not only are special precautions necessary when using these solvents, it is also recognized that volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from such solvents are tightly regulated by the U.S. government. Applicants have discovered that, surprisingly, spent coffee grounds can be rendered useful as adsorbents for improving flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extracts without the removal of lipids. The use of organic solvents is therefore unnecessary for providing the processed coffee grounds of the present invention. Because lipids are not removed from the starting spent coffee grounds to arrive at the improved processed coffee grounds, the processed grounds comprise greater than 2% lipids. The improved processed coffee grounds may allow lower usage levels in coffee compositions while achieving desirable removal of off coffee flavors. While prior art methods have utilized adsorbents to enhance the flavor of coffee, there is a continuing need for improved adsorbents to further enhance brewed coffee flavor. Applicants' use of spent grounds processed in accordance with the description below provides coffee flavor benefits, while also utilizing a material that is otherwise of limited, if any, value. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a composition for preparing fresh brewed coffee beverages wherein the composition comprises processed coffee grounds (PCGs) that are described herein. In particular, the composition comprises processed coffee grounds and roasted and ground coffee. The invention is further directed to a process for making a composition of the present invention, the process comprising combining roasted and ground coffee and PCGs in a ratio of from about 200:1 to about 10:1. The invention is still further directed to a process for making brewed coffee, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention with water to generate a brewed coffee; and (ii) collecting the brewed coffee for subsequent consumption. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a coffee concentrate, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention with water to generate a coffee concentrate; and (ii) collecting the concentrate for eventual packaging for sale to a consumer. The invention is still further directed to a process for making soluble coffee, comprising contacting a coffee extract with processed coffee grounds described herein. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION I. Definitions: The term “brewed coffee” means a coffee beverage obtained by aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee using conventional brewing devices (e.g., percolators, electric percolators, drip coffee makers, automatic drip coffee makers). Use herein of the term “brewed coffee beverage” refers to a liquid beverage that is intended for consumption without further processing, other than manipulation by the end consumer (e.g., addition of flavors, creams, sweeteners, or the like). The term “coffee concentrate” means a liquid coffee extract, or a dried product of the extract, obtained by aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, wherein such extract is further processed (e.g., diluted) prior to consumption. The term “coffee extract” means a liquid extract of roasted and ground coffee, or a dried product of the extract, obtained during the manufacture of soluble (i.e., instant) coffee. As used herein, the term “coffee extract” refers to an “intermediate” liquid or solid that is subsequently processed and eventually dried to provide soluble (instant) coffee particles. The term “comprising” means that the various components, ingredients, or steps can be conjointly employed in practicing the present invention. Accordingly, the term “comprising” encompasses the more restrictive terms “consisting essentially of” and “consisting of”. The term “high temperature extraction” means aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, the water temperature exceeding about 65° C. (149° F.). The term “instant coffee beverage” means a coffee beverage obtained by dissolving soluble (i.e., instant) coffee particles in a liquid medium, typically heated water. The terms “instant” and “soluble” are used interchangeably herein. The term “low temperature extraction” means aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, the water temperature being not more than about 65° C. (149° F.). The term or symbols for “percent” refers to weight-weight percent, unless otherwise indicated. The term “processed coffee grounds” or “PCGs” means the residue of coffee grounds remaining after an aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee. Because lipids are not removed from the starting spent coffee grounds to obtain the PCGs used herein, the PCGs will comprise greater than 2% lipids. Typically the PCGs will comprise at least about 5% lipids, more typically at least about 10% lipids and still more typically at least about 15% lipids. Reference herein to ratios is on a weight-weight basis, unless otherwise specified. II. PCGs, Compositions and Processes According to the present invention, it has now been found that the processed coffee grounds described herein function as an inexpensive adsorbent that selectively reduces burnt coffee flavors, bitter coffee flavors, or modulates the flavor characteristic of coffee (e.g., reduces acidity) without contaminating the coffee beverage or sacrificing coffee yield. When PCGs are added to roasted and ground coffee particles, the resulting composition can be extracted by conventional water (typically hot water) methods to produce an improved brewed coffee, coffee concentrate or coffee extract. The following describes in more detail the PCGs useful herein, compositions containing PCGs and processes for making the compositions, and processes for brewing coffee and making soluble coffee using the PCGs. A. PCGs As mentioned, Applicants have discovered that the functional adsorbent quality of spent coffee grounds is directly proportional to the extent to which they have been extracted with water, up to a point where they have reached their maximum potential. Spent coffee grounds taken directly from a coffee brewer and dried may not exhibit an adsorbent quality in a coffee composition to be sensorially perceptible. For these grounds to demonstrate functional absorbency (and to therefore function as PCGs per the present invention), they may need to be further processed with additional water extractions. This is because the extraction conditions don't allow for sufficient removal of the otherwise extractable components. In contrast, coffee grounds resulting from the manufacture of soluble coffee will typically require no additional extraction to function as PCGs, although some degree of additional processing (e.g., drying, as discussed below) may be necessary to optimize their functionality. It is well recognized to those skilled in the art that the extent the roasted and ground particles are extracted is contingent upon the method of extraction (e.g., batch or multiple batch versus continuous, static or mixed bed, co-current versus counter-current), specific equipment selection, extraction efficiencies, time, temperatures utilized, and the like. It would be easily recognized by those skilled in the art that the degree of extraction chosen will be based on the desired adsorbency effect and economics, realizing that at some point further extraction will eventually bring diminishing returns. It has been further discovered that these water extractions will induce the adsorbent functionality of the grounds in the presence of any lipids naturally present within or on the surface of the grounds. Further, it has been found that coffee grounds that have been first decaffeinated using known processes to those skilled in the art, prior to water extraction(s), will also exhibit adsorbent functionality. Surprisingly, it has been found that although there is a high lipid level within the spent coffee grounds, off flavors normally associated with lipid oxidation by-products, do not occur when the PCGs are dried under mild conditions and are then fresh packaged. Because the starting spent coffee grounds are not subjected to extraction by lipophilic solvents as described in the Rizzi patent, the PCGs will comprise greater than 2%, by total weight, lipids, and typically significantly higher lipid levels. The PCGs will typically comprise at least about 5% lipids, more typically at least about 10% lipids and still more typically at least about 15% lipids. Typically, the PCGs will comprise from about 5% to about 20% lipids. The lipid content of the PCGs is measured using Method Number 920.39 as described in “Official Methods of Analysis” of The Association of Official Analytical Chemists. This method is described in detail in the Test Methods section below. The average particle size of the PCG particles will preferably range from about 20 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Series to about 200 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Series, although particle sizes outside this range would also be acceptable. Within this range, particle size has little impact on the efficacy of the PCGs. When derived from a soluble coffee manufacturing process, the dried PCGs may be larger granules than a 20 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve. These larger granules can be further comminuted to granules consistent with typical roasted and ground products without affecting the adsorbent functionality of the PCGs. Various types of grinders known in the industry can be used for this purpose. As PCG particle size varies within the above range, surface area also varies but efficacy as an adsorbent for bad coffee flavors appears to remain substantially unchanged. PCGs are extracted (and typically dried) coffee grounds that are known to contain approximately 10-15% protein. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, since some prior art adsorbents used in coffee brewing contain a large protein component, it is believed that the processing of the PCGs removes components already adsorbed to these proteins within the grounds. Once removed, and placed in contact with an aqueous extraction medium, these proteins are available to re-adsorb negative flavored components, thus reducing/removing them from the resulting brewed coffee, coffee concentrate or coffee extract. PCGs can be derived from low, intermediate or high quality coffee beans, or blends thereof. In order to maximize the economic benefit of using “spent” grounds, preferred are low quality coffees or blends containing low quality coffee. Non-limiting examples of low quality beans include robustas, low grade naturals such as Haiti XXX, Peru Natural, Salvadors, low grade Brazils, and low grade unwashed Arabicas such as the Ugandas, Indonesians, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Equador, Resacas and Guatemalan TMS. PCGs can be derived from any coffee source, but for economic reasons are preferably derived as a by-product of soluble coffee manufacturing. PCGs contain less than about 1% soluble coffee solids. PCGs therefore make a plentiful, inexpensive material for inclusion in coffee compositions. Soluble coffees are usually produced by counter current extraction mechanisms well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, an aqueous extraction medium at temperatures from about 65° C. (149° F.) to about 175° C. (330° F.) passes through a series of extraction columns filled with roasted and ground coffee with fresh aqueous extraction medium starting at the column with the most extracted roasted and ground coffee, moving sequentially through the series of columns, and eventually through the last column of fresh roasted and ground coffee. The extract is then collected, a new column of fresh roasted and ground coffee is added to the end of the column sequence, and the first column is discarded as spent coffee grounds. The spent coffee grounds are released from the extraction column by opening the hot, pressurized column and blowing the pressurized grounds into a holding vessel. These grounds can subsequently be processed to provide PCGs as described herein. Many variations of the counter current method have been described, as well as non-counter current methods of manufacturing soluble coffee, all of which provide an acceptable source of PCGs for the present invention. PCGs contain a large lipid component that can be oxidized, increasing the likelihood of developing an adsorbent aftertaste on the eventual product of the invention. Accordingly, although PCGs may be functional in a wet state, it is desirable to avoid the oxidation of any lipids during further processing of the coffee grounds. It is also important that the PCGs be microbially stable. Accordingly, it may be preferable to dry the PCGs prior to further processing. For example, mild drying conditions can be employed in drying the PCGs to achieve this goal. In one preferred embodiment, for example where the PCGs are combined with roasted and ground coffee, the PCGs will have a moisture content of less than about 10%. The method for measuring moisture content is described in the Test Method section below. PCGs being porous granules can be dried in a variety of ways, including but not limited to convective drying, forced air drying, fluidized bed drying, vacuum drying, infrared drying, or microwave drying. Indeed, any conventional drying process that does not subject the PCGs to temperatures or for extended lengths of time that would degrade the PCG structure or the components making up the PCG structure or promote oxidation, or other chemical degradation, can be used. Fluidized bed drying is preferred due to its milder temperatures and speed of drying so as to minimize lipid oxidation, as well as its reduced complexity and economics. The newly manufactured and dried PCGs appear as a customary granular coffee, which is substantially odorless and tasteless. As mentioned, PCGs are derived from any source, but preferably are derived as a by-product of soluble coffee manufacturing. B. Compositions and Processes PCGs are added to roasted and ground coffee to form the composition of the current invention. The PCGs and roasted and ground coffee can be combined by conventional dry mixing methods. As a matter of convenience in manufacture, the PCGs can be added to whole bean roasted coffee prior to grinding and ground simultaneously. This is particularly useful when the PCGs are of larger particle size than is customary for retail roasted and ground products. (For example, when the PCGs are derived from a soluble coffee manufacturing process.) The simultaneous grinding has the further advantage of providing intermixing resulting in a more homogeneous coffee blend. The weight ratio of roasted and ground coffee to PCGs will typically be from about 10:1 to about 200:1, more typically from about 30:1 to about 170:1, still more typically from about 65:1 to about 133:1. A composition with a ratio greater than 200:1 typically will provide an insignificant benefit from the PCGs, and a composition with a ratio less than 10:1 typically will produce a weak coffee with some adsorbent aftertaste. Of course, these general parameters will be dictated by the relative adsorbent capacity of the PCGs utilized, which is impacted by various factors as discussed above. Accordingly, the ranges provided herein are not meant to limit the scope of the appended claims. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention will comprise roasted and ground coffee, PCGs and soluble coffee. In one such embodiment, this composition is useful in a product similar to the Folger's Singles® product (marketed by the Procter & Gamble Company), which provides an “instant”, one cup coffee preparation. The beverage is generated by steeping a water permeable packet containing the PCGs, the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee particles. Examples of coffee-containing packets are well known in the literature. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 1,454,739 to C. B. Holland et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,531,594 to L. H. Abrams et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,183,096 to E. F. Hiscock et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,640,727 to M. R. Heusinkveld, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In those embodiments where instant coffee is included with the PCGs and the roasted and ground coffee, the instant coffee particles can be prepared by any convenient process. A variety of such processes are known to those skilled in the art. Conventionally, instant coffee is prepared by roasting and grinding a blend of coffee beans, extracting the roasted and ground coffee with water to form an aqueous coffee extract, and drying the extract to form “instant coffee.” Typical roasting equipment and methods for roasting coffee beans are described, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 1, pp. 203-226. Typical oil expelling equipment is described, for example, in Sivetz, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 2, pp. 27-30; typical grinding equipment is described, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, supra, pp. 239-250. Typical disclosures of equipment and methods which can be used for extracting coffee include: U.S. Pat. No. 2,562,206 to Nutting et al., Sivetz & Foote, supra, pp. 261-378; and U.S. Pat. No. 2,515,730 to Omfelt et al. Typical disclosures of spray drying processes which can be used to prepare instant coffee particles can be found, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 1, pp. 382-513; U.S. Pat. No. 2,771,343 to Chase et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,750,998 to Moore, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,469,553 to Hall. The instant coffee component can be any one of the commercially available instant coffees sold on the market, or combinations thereof. These include spray dried instant coffee powders, agglomerates and freeze-dried chunks. Examples of instant coffees useful herein include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,436,227 to Bergeron et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,493,388 to Hair, U.S. Pat. No. 3,615,669 to Hair et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,620,756 to Strobel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,637,397 to Menzies et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,293 to Lombana et al. The instant coffee used may be any single variety of coffee or a blend of different varieties. The instant coffee component may be regular or decaffeinated. The instant coffee may optionally be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic such as expresso, French roast, or the like. The roasted and ground coffee can be derived from low, intermediate or high quality coffee beans, or blends thereof. The roasted and ground coffee can be either decaffeinated or non-decaffeinated. PCGs can be added to straight or blended coffees of various degrees of roast. PCG usage level is determined by the effect desired. For example, for a blend of coffees where one component is roasted darker for a requisite flavor but incurs an increase in bitterness, PCGs can be added at higher levels to offset or minimize the increased bitterness. Low quality roasted and ground coffee beans have an undesirable or excessive bitter flavor that can be reduced by PCGs. Some lower quality coffee beans may also have a rather strong characteristic flavor that can become a flavor negative when used at too high of levels within a blend of coffees, i.e., the characteristic flavor becomes too dominant. PCGs can be added at a level to achieve the desired effect of modulating this characteristic flavor. Non-limiting examples of low quality beans include robustas, low grade naturals such as Haiti XXX, Peru Natural, Salvadors, low grade Brazils, and low grade unwashed Arabicas, such as the Ugandas, Indonesians, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Equador, Resacas and Guatemalan TMS. Processes for making decaffeinated and non-decaffeinated roasted and ground coffee are well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,935 to Kirkpatrick et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,573 to Stefanucci et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,821 to Morrison et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,262 to Wolfson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,263 to Patel et al., the disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference. Likewise, the composition of the invention can also be used by consumers to make a brewed coffee having a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. The coffee composition can be packaged the same as a conventional roasted and ground coffee for the consumer market. The composition does not leave an unpleasant adsorbent aftertaste in the brewed coffee and, most importantly, consumers can obtain the flavor benefit of the invention by conventional brewing methods—hot water extraction using conventional consumer brewing devices (e.g., percolators, electric percolators, drip coffee makers, automatic drip coffee makers). In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for making a composition of the present invention, the process comprising combining roasted and ground coffee and PCGs in a ratio of from about 200:1 to about 10:1. As discussed above, the PCGs can be combined with the roasted and ground coffee particles either after the roasted particles are ground, or during the grinding process itself. The PCGs can be combined with the roasted and ground particles to form a relatively homogeneous blend. Such a homogeneous blend is preferred when the product is to be sold as a bulk brewed coffee product (e.g., sold in traditional cans). Alternatively, the PCGs and roasted and ground coffee can be combined in a heterogeneous manner (e.g., two distinct layers). Such a heterogeneous blend would be useful where the coffee components are to be sold in a packet for brewing in a drip coffee maker. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a coffee concentrate, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention (i.e., containing PCGs) with water to generate a coffee concentrate; and (ii) collecting the concentrate for eventual packaging for distribution to a consumer. In the water extraction step, the water is preferably heated to a temperature of at least about 65° C. (149° F.). According to this process, the resulting coffee concentrate is in either liquid or solid form. The concentrate is then packaged for eventual distribution, where some additional processing (e.g., dilution) is required to provide a consumable beverage. The invention is still further directed to a process for making soluble coffee comprising contacting a coffee extract with PCGs described herein. In one embodiment for making soluble coffee, the PCGs and roast and ground coffee are added to counter current extraction columns so as to produce a coffee extract with a modulated flavor having reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. In an alternative embodiment, a coffee extract (e.g., derived from roast and ground hot temperature extraction) containing from about 5% to about 25% soluble coffee solids is first devolatilized by stripping away the flavor compounds. Then it is concentrated, preferably to from about 30% to about 50% soluble coffee solids, using methods commonly known to those skilled in the art. This concentrated extract is then contacted with PCGs prior to adding back flavor compounds and spray drying. Alternatively, a soluble coffee extract (e.g., derived from roasted and ground hot temperature extraction) is contacted with PCGs after first removing the volatile components. Then the devolatilized PCG-treated coffee extract is subject to a concentration process, the volatile compounds are added back and then dried. Yet another alternative is to devolatilize the initial coffee extract, then concentrate it to from about 30% to about 50% coffee solids, then add back the volatiles and then contact the complete mixture with PCGs before spray drying. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a brewed coffee beverage, the process comprising (i) contacting a roasted and ground coffee and PCGs with water to generate a brewed coffee; and (ii) collecting the brewed coffee for subsequent consumption. This process is most typically carried out using conventional drip coffee makers. In this process, a preferred embodiment is where the composition is subjected to high temperature extraction in step (i). In one embodiment, the roasted and ground coffee and the PCGs are combined in a single composition prior to being contacted with water. Alternatively, the roasted and ground coffee and the PCGs may be separate when contacted by the water. (For example, the two may be in separate compartments of a single package.) III. Test Methods—Moisture Content; Water Activity; and Lipid Content The moisture content of the PCGs is determined by a gravimetric method similar to Method Number 931.04 as described in the Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15 th Edition, 1990. A 10 g sample of the wet processed grounds is accurately weighed in an aluminum pan and dried to constant weight at 100° C. in an oven with air circulation. The water activity (ratio of vapor pressure of water in product to vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature) of the PCGs is determined by a method similar to Method Number 978.18, ibid. Here a Rotronic hygroscop® water activity meter made by Rotronic AG, Grindelstrasse 6, CH-8303 Bassersdorf, Switzerland, equipped with a WA40-TH constant temperature measuring cell, is used. Crude lipid content of the PCGs is determined by exhaustive extraction of the lipids based on Method Number 920.39 as described in the Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15 th Edition, 1990. Any one of the solvents—petroleum ether, hexane, chloroform, diethylether and methanol, or a combination thereof—can be used as the extraction solvent. IV. EXAMPLES Example 1 Roasted and ground coffee is further processed to provide functional benefits in a coffee matrix by the following batch preparation. 40 g of Folgers® French-Roast roasted and ground coffee is added to a Bunn™ model OL-35 commercial coffee machine's filter basket containing a paper coffee filter. The brew button is depressed and the coffee is automatically extracted in the typical manner. Upon completion, the soluble portion is discarded and the insoluble coffee grounds are obtained and transferred to a 4 L beaker. For the first extraction, these coffee grounds are further processed by addition of 1700 mL of distilled and deionized water. The contents are stirred using a large spatula to suspend the grounds, and then allowed to stand for several minutes to allow the coffee grounds to settle. Approximately ⅓ of the bulk liquid is then decanted off to remove the fines that have remained in suspension. The remaining grounds are once again resuspended in the remaining liquid by stirring with a spatula, and are immediately poured into a coffee basket that is supported by a stand and that contains a fresh coffee filter. The filtrate is allowed to drain and is discarded. The coffee grounds are again transferred to a clean 4-liter beaker. For the second extraction, 1700 mL of water is added and the procedure is repeated for a total of six extractions. After the sixth extraction, these further processed grounds are transferred from the filter paper and spread out in a 1 O-inch aluminum pie pan, for drying. The pan is placed in a Blue M™ Stabil-Therm fan-forced laboratory convection oven Model ESP-401C, held at 60° C. for 18 hours, then allowed to cool to room temperature. These further processed coffee grounds remain physically, microbially, and chemically stable when packaged in accordance with customary roasted and ground coffee products. The water activity of these processed coffee grounds is less than 0.85a w @25° C. and the moisture content is less than 9.72%. Example 2 A 2.5 g (5%) sample of the processed coffee grounds from Example 1 is put into a quart-size glass jar followed by 50 g of Folgers® French-Roast roasted and ground coffee. The jar is capped and shaken to mix the contents. The admixed coffee is placed into a Bunn™ model OL-35 commercial coffee machine's filter basket containing a paper coffee filter. The brew button is depressed and the coffee is automatically brewed in the typical manner. The resulting brewed coffee is less bitter, and has less off-flavor than a control coffee made in the same manner but omitting the dried processed coffee grounds. Example 3 A small slit is cut into Folgers® Singles coffee bag (sold by The Procter & Gamble Company) using an X-acto knife and 0.25 g (nominally 5%) of the processed coffee grounds from Example 1 is introduced into the coffee bag, containing nominally 4.42 g of a blend of ground and concentrated coffees. The bag is re-sealed using a Sealboy™ thermal package sealer type 235 SA from Packaging Aids Corporation with a sealing time set to 10. The bag is added to an eight ounce Styrofoam™ cup, boiling water is added and the contents are allowed to brew for 60 seconds. The bag is then dunked up and down for 30 seconds whereupon the bag is withdrawn from the beverage and discarded. The resulting beverage is less bitter and has a reduced coffee concentrate flavor as compared to a Folgers® Singles control made in a similar manner but without the processed coffee grounds. Example 4 Roasted and ground coffee can be further processed on a commercial scale to provide the functional benefits in a coffee matrix, using known commercial processes. Roasted and ground coffee is added to a battery of commercial percolation extractors known and used in the industry for preparation of soluble coffee extract, as described in Coffee Technology, Vol. 2, Chapter 5, Edited by R. J. Clarke and R.Macrae© (Elsevier Applied Science Publishers LTD (1987). The number of extraction columns in such batteries typically ranges from five to eight. These grounds can be made functional by processing as described, following the industrial practice of using higher feed water temperatures, up to 180° C. in a countercurrent fashion with the roasted coffee, i.e., the most exhausted coffee being contacted first. Typically the temperature of the liquor and grounds is then reduced to around 100° C. by the time the freshest grounds are contacted. The soluble extract from such processing can be subsequently dried as instant coffee. The remaining processed coffee grounds are removed from their respective columns and conveyed to a screw-press, known and used in the industry to effectively remove bulk water. The mechanical forces imposed on the coffee grounds by the screw-press reduces the moisture content from about 98% to about a 56%. The damp grounds are conveyed to a fluidized bed drier, and dried to a final moisture level of less than 9.72% with a water activity of less than 0.85a w @25° C. Drying conditions for a 6-inch static bed height of coffee grounds and an 18 to 20 minute residence time can be accomplished with an air inlet temperature of 86.10° C. and an air flux of 1.25 kg/m 2 /s. These dried grounds are physically, microbially, and chemically stable and can be transferred to appropriate storage facilities such as a silo, or they can be immediately packaged. Coffee grounds processed in this manner provide the intended functional benefit, when added to and packaged with customary roasted and ground coffee products, or when used on a commercial scale in the manufacture of instant-coffee or liquid coffee concentrates. Example 5 A coffee blend is prepared by mixing 10 g (30%) roasted and ground Arabican variety coffee beans with 23.3 g (70%) roasted and ground Robusta variety coffee beans. To this mixture (33.3 g) is added an additional 0.17 g (0.5%) of the processed coffee grounds from Example 4, and the mixture is blended well. The coffee mix is added to a Mr. Coffee™ model PRX23 0898 retail coffee brewer's basket containing a paper coffee filter and is brewed with 1420 mL of distilled and deionized water and a coffee beverage (designated as Coffee Beverage A) is obtained. Another coffee beverage (designated as Coffee Beverage B) is prepared from a 33.3 g of coffee blend comprising 50% roasted and ground Arabican variety coffee beans with 50% roasted and ground Robusta variety coffee beans. Coffee Beverage A, brewed with the dried processed coffee grounds, has a less bitter aftertaste, is a little more balanced, with slightly less strength as compared to Coffee Beverage B. Example 6 An instant coffee or coffee concentrate is prepared on a commercial scale using known commercial processes, by the addition of PCGs in the coffee matrix. A blend comprising roasted and ground coffee and 1.5% PCGs from Example 4 are added to a battery of commercial percolation extractors known and used in the industry for preparation of soluble coffee extract, as described in Coffee Technology, Vol 2, Chapter 5, Edited by R. J. Clarke and R.Macrae©, Elsevier Applied Science Publishers LTD (1987). The number of extraction columns in such batteries typically range from five to eight. Following industrial practices, the columns are operated in a counter-current mode, i.e., the most exhausted coffee in the extraction battery is contacted first with higher feed water temperatures, up to 180° C. Typically the temperature of the liquor and grounds is then reduced to around 100° C. by the time the freshest grounds are contacted. The liquid coffee extract concentrate, resulting from such processing and the starting coffee blend, will have a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. This liquid extract can be further concentrated if desired using known processes to remove bulk water, to produce a liquid coffee concentrate for commerce. Alternatively, the liquid coffee concentrate can be subsequently dried as an improved instant coffee having a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors.","20030026883"

The compositions of the invention comprise processed coffee grounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The art includes numerous methods directed toward enhancing the flavor of instant coffee, brewed coffee and coffee extracts. With respect to brewed coffee and coffee extracts, these methods typically attempt to achieve this goal without sacrificing the desirable yields and conveniences associated with conventional high temperature (generally at least about 65° C. (149° F.)) coffee extraction. It is generally recognized that high temperature coffee extraction is convenient and economical to the end user, but that flavor is often compromised. That is, end users (both at home consumers and those in an industrial setting) prefer the convenience of conventional brewing appliances, which use high temperature extraction. It follows, then, that to be of appeal to consumers or to industry, methods of enhancing flavor must do so without sacrificing convenience. Additionally, the methods must provide these attributes while being economical to the end user. Selective extraction is one general approach to improving the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extract. According to this approach, a preferred ratio of bad to good coffee flavors are extracted from roasted and ground coffee. Ideally, this selective extraction improves the overall flavor of brewed coffees or coffee extracts without compromising its flavor strength or extraction yield. Two well known selective extraction methods are low temperature extraction and selective extraction via adsorbents. Although both methods are known to improve coffee flavor, it is also recognized that each method has serious deficiencies. For example, low temperature extraction generally provides lower yields than high temperature extraction. Unlike low temperature extraction, adsorbents accommodate high temperature conditions and also preferably adsorb a favorable ratio of bad flavor components to good flavor components without sacrificing yield and convenience. Adsorbents used in roasted and ground coffee include activated carbons (i.e., activated charcoals), carbohydrates and carbohydrate polymers (e.g., alginic acid), synthetic polyamides, insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, certain mineral substances (e.g. aluminum oxides, silica gel), amidated cellulose materials (e.g., chitosan, chitan), and proteinaceous materials (e.g. gelatin, zein). These prior art adsorbents have been used in various ways to improve the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extracts. Some have been added to extraction columns in industry, to the extract from extraction columns, to packaged roasted and ground coffee marketed for consumer use, or to the structure of coffee filters used in conventional brewing devices. These adsorbents improve the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extract by either adsorbing (and therefore removing) a favorable ratio of bad flavor components to good flavor components, or by adsorbing good flavor components during storage and releasing them upon extraction. In spite of the flavor improvements, adsorbents described in the prior art are typically expensive and may pass into the final coffee beverage, thereby providing negative mouth feel character. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,328,708, Rizzi et al. describe a process for removing lipids from spent coffee grounds so they comprise less than 2% lipids, whereupon they are suitable for use as an adsorbent for bitter coffee flavors and burnt coffee aromas. The removal of lipids is accomplished via organic solvent extraction using lipophilic solvents, such as ethanol, methanol, chloroform, hexane and ethyl acetate. Although this method is known to improve coffee flavor, it is also recognized that the method has deficiencies. For example, it is well recognized in the industry that the use of organic solvent systems is not only very capital intensive, but can be problematic when dealing with solvent reclamation, safety, and environmental issues. These problems can be further compounded when dealing with multiple solvent systems. Not only are special precautions necessary when using these solvents, it is also recognized that volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from such solvents are tightly regulated by the U.S. government. Applicants have discovered that, surprisingly, spent coffee grounds can be rendered useful as adsorbents for improving flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extracts without the removal of lipids. The use of organic solvents is therefore unnecessary for providing the processed coffee grounds of the present invention. Because lipids are not removed from the starting spent coffee grounds to arrive at the improved processed coffee grounds, the processed grounds comprise greater than 2% lipids. The improved processed coffee grounds may allow lower usage levels in coffee compositions while achieving desirable removal of off coffee flavors. While prior art methods have utilized adsorbents to enhance the flavor of coffee, there is a continuing need for improved adsorbents to further enhance brewed coffee flavor. Applicants' use of spent grounds processed in accordance with the description below provides coffee flavor benefits, while also utilizing a material that is otherwise of limited, if any, value. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a composition for preparing fresh brewed coffee beverages wherein the composition comprises processed coffee grounds (PCGs) that are described herein. In particular, the composition comprises processed coffee grounds and roasted and ground coffee. The invention is further directed to a process for making a composition of the present invention, the process comprising combining roasted and ground coffee and PCGs in a ratio of from about 200:1 to about 10:1. The invention is still further directed to a process for making brewed coffee, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention with water to generate a brewed coffee; and (ii) collecting the brewed coffee for subsequent consumption. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a coffee concentrate, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention with water to generate a coffee concentrate; and (ii) collecting the concentrate for eventual packaging for sale to a consumer. The invention is still further directed to a process for making soluble coffee, comprising contacting a coffee extract with processed coffee grounds described herein. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION I. Definitions: The term “brewed coffee” means a coffee beverage obtained by aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee using conventional brewing devices (e.g., percolators, electric percolators, drip coffee makers, automatic drip coffee makers). Use herein of the term “brewed coffee beverage” refers to a liquid beverage that is intended for consumption without further processing, other than manipulation by the end consumer (e.g., addition of flavors, creams, sweeteners, or the like). The term “coffee concentrate” means a liquid coffee extract, or a dried product of the extract, obtained by aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, wherein such extract is further processed (e.g., diluted) prior to consumption. The term “coffee extract” means a liquid extract of roasted and ground coffee, or a dried product of the extract, obtained during the manufacture of soluble (i.e., instant) coffee. As used herein, the term “coffee extract” refers to an “intermediate” liquid or solid that is subsequently processed and eventually dried to provide soluble (instant) coffee particles. The term “comprising” means that the various components, ingredients, or steps can be conjointly employed in practicing the present invention. Accordingly, the term “comprising” encompasses the more restrictive terms “consisting essentially of” and “consisting of”. The term “high temperature extraction” means aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, the water temperature exceeding about 65° C. (149° F.). The term “instant coffee beverage” means a coffee beverage obtained by dissolving soluble (i.e., instant) coffee particles in a liquid medium, typically heated water. The terms “instant” and “soluble” are used interchangeably herein. The term “low temperature extraction” means aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, the water temperature being not more than about 65° C. (149° F.). The term or symbols for “percent” refers to weight-weight percent, unless otherwise indicated. The term “processed coffee grounds” or “PCGs” means the residue of coffee grounds remaining after an aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee. Because lipids are not removed from the starting spent coffee grounds to obtain the PCGs used herein, the PCGs will comprise greater than 2% lipids. Typically the PCGs will comprise at least about 5% lipids, more typically at least about 10% lipids and still more typically at least about 15% lipids. Reference herein to ratios is on a weight-weight basis, unless otherwise specified. II. PCGs, Compositions and Processes According to the present invention, it has now been found that the processed coffee grounds described herein function as an inexpensive adsorbent that selectively reduces burnt coffee flavors, bitter coffee flavors, or modulates the flavor characteristic of coffee (e.g., reduces acidity) without contaminating the coffee beverage or sacrificing coffee yield. When PCGs are added to roasted and ground coffee particles, the resulting composition can be extracted by conventional water (typically hot water) methods to produce an improved brewed coffee, coffee concentrate or coffee extract. The following describes in more detail the PCGs useful herein, compositions containing PCGs and processes for making the compositions, and processes for brewing coffee and making soluble coffee using the PCGs. A. PCGs As mentioned, Applicants have discovered that the functional adsorbent quality of spent coffee grounds is directly proportional to the extent to which they have been extracted with water, up to a point where they have reached their maximum potential. Spent coffee grounds taken directly from a coffee brewer and dried may not exhibit an adsorbent quality in a coffee composition to be sensorially perceptible. For these grounds to demonstrate functional absorbency (and to therefore function as PCGs per the present invention), they may need to be further processed with additional water extractions. This is because the extraction conditions don't allow for sufficient removal of the otherwise extractable components. In contrast, coffee grounds resulting from the manufacture of soluble coffee will typically require no additional extraction to function as PCGs, although some degree of additional processing (e.g., drying, as discussed below) may be necessary to optimize their functionality. It is well recognized to those skilled in the art that the extent the roasted and ground particles are extracted is contingent upon the method of extraction (e.g., batch or multiple batch versus continuous, static or mixed bed, co-current versus counter-current), specific equipment selection, extraction efficiencies, time, temperatures utilized, and the like. It would be easily recognized by those skilled in the art that the degree of extraction chosen will be based on the desired adsorbency effect and economics, realizing that at some point further extraction will eventually bring diminishing returns. It has been further discovered that these water extractions will induce the adsorbent functionality of the grounds in the presence of any lipids naturally present within or on the surface of the grounds. Further, it has been found that coffee grounds that have been first decaffeinated using known processes to those skilled in the art, prior to water extraction(s), will also exhibit adsorbent functionality. Surprisingly, it has been found that although there is a high lipid level within the spent coffee grounds, off flavors normally associated with lipid oxidation by-products, do not occur when the PCGs are dried under mild conditions and are then fresh packaged. Because the starting spent coffee grounds are not subjected to extraction by lipophilic solvents as described in the Rizzi patent, the PCGs will comprise greater than 2%, by total weight, lipids, and typically significantly higher lipid levels. The PCGs will typically comprise at least about 5% lipids, more typically at least about 10% lipids and still more typically at least about 15% lipids. Typically, the PCGs will comprise from about 5% to about 20% lipids. The lipid content of the PCGs is measured using Method Number 920.39 as described in “Official Methods of Analysis” of The Association of Official Analytical Chemists. This method is described in detail in the Test Methods section below. The average particle size of the PCG particles will preferably range from about 20 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Series to about 200 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Series, although particle sizes outside this range would also be acceptable. Within this range, particle size has little impact on the efficacy of the PCGs. When derived from a soluble coffee manufacturing process, the dried PCGs may be larger granules than a 20 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve. These larger granules can be further comminuted to granules consistent with typical roasted and ground products without affecting the adsorbent functionality of the PCGs. Various types of grinders known in the industry can be used for this purpose. As PCG particle size varies within the above range, surface area also varies but efficacy as an adsorbent for bad coffee flavors appears to remain substantially unchanged. PCGs are extracted (and typically dried) coffee grounds that are known to contain approximately 10-15% protein. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, since some prior art adsorbents used in coffee brewing contain a large protein component, it is believed that the processing of the PCGs removes components already adsorbed to these proteins within the grounds. Once removed, and placed in contact with an aqueous extraction medium, these proteins are available to re-adsorb negative flavored components, thus reducing/removing them from the resulting brewed coffee, coffee concentrate or coffee extract. PCGs can be derived from low, intermediate or high quality coffee beans, or blends thereof. In order to maximize the economic benefit of using “spent” grounds, preferred are low quality coffees or blends containing low quality coffee. Non-limiting examples of low quality beans include robustas, low grade naturals such as Haiti XXX, Peru Natural, Salvadors, low grade Brazils, and low grade unwashed Arabicas such as the Ugandas, Indonesians, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Equador, Resacas and Guatemalan TMS. PCGs can be derived from any coffee source, but for economic reasons are preferably derived as a by-product of soluble coffee manufacturing. PCGs contain less than about 1% soluble coffee solids. PCGs therefore make a plentiful, inexpensive material for inclusion in coffee compositions. Soluble coffees are usually produced by counter current extraction mechanisms well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, an aqueous extraction medium at temperatures from about 65° C. (149° F.) to about 175° C. (330° F.) passes through a series of extraction columns filled with roasted and ground coffee with fresh aqueous extraction medium starting at the column with the most extracted roasted and ground coffee, moving sequentially through the series of columns, and eventually through the last column of fresh roasted and ground coffee. The extract is then collected, a new column of fresh roasted and ground coffee is added to the end of the column sequence, and the first column is discarded as spent coffee grounds. The spent coffee grounds are released from the extraction column by opening the hot, pressurized column and blowing the pressurized grounds into a holding vessel. These grounds can subsequently be processed to provide PCGs as described herein. Many variations of the counter current method have been described, as well as non-counter current methods of manufacturing soluble coffee, all of which provide an acceptable source of PCGs for the present invention. PCGs contain a large lipid component that can be oxidized, increasing the likelihood of developing an adsorbent aftertaste on the eventual product of the invention. Accordingly, although PCGs may be functional in a wet state, it is desirable to avoid the oxidation of any lipids during further processing of the coffee grounds. It is also important that the PCGs be microbially stable. Accordingly, it may be preferable to dry the PCGs prior to further processing. For example, mild drying conditions can be employed in drying the PCGs to achieve this goal. In one preferred embodiment, for example where the PCGs are combined with roasted and ground coffee, the PCGs will have a moisture content of less than about 10%. The method for measuring moisture content is described in the Test Method section below. PCGs being porous granules can be dried in a variety of ways, including but not limited to convective drying, forced air drying, fluidized bed drying, vacuum drying, infrared drying, or microwave drying. Indeed, any conventional drying process that does not subject the PCGs to temperatures or for extended lengths of time that would degrade the PCG structure or the components making up the PCG structure or promote oxidation, or other chemical degradation, can be used. Fluidized bed drying is preferred due to its milder temperatures and speed of drying so as to minimize lipid oxidation, as well as its reduced complexity and economics. The newly manufactured and dried PCGs appear as a customary granular coffee, which is substantially odorless and tasteless. As mentioned, PCGs are derived from any source, but preferably are derived as a by-product of soluble coffee manufacturing. B. Compositions and Processes PCGs are added to roasted and ground coffee to form the composition of the current invention. The PCGs and roasted and ground coffee can be combined by conventional dry mixing methods. As a matter of convenience in manufacture, the PCGs can be added to whole bean roasted coffee prior to grinding and ground simultaneously. This is particularly useful when the PCGs are of larger particle size than is customary for retail roasted and ground products. (For example, when the PCGs are derived from a soluble coffee manufacturing process.) The simultaneous grinding has the further advantage of providing intermixing resulting in a more homogeneous coffee blend. The weight ratio of roasted and ground coffee to PCGs will typically be from about 10:1 to about 200:1, more typically from about 30:1 to about 170:1, still more typically from about 65:1 to about 133:1. A composition with a ratio greater than 200:1 typically will provide an insignificant benefit from the PCGs, and a composition with a ratio less than 10:1 typically will produce a weak coffee with some adsorbent aftertaste. Of course, these general parameters will be dictated by the relative adsorbent capacity of the PCGs utilized, which is impacted by various factors as discussed above. Accordingly, the ranges provided herein are not meant to limit the scope of the appended claims. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention will comprise roasted and ground coffee, PCGs and soluble coffee. In one such embodiment, this composition is useful in a product similar to the Folger's Singles® product (marketed by the Procter & Gamble Company), which provides an “instant”, one cup coffee preparation. The beverage is generated by steeping a water permeable packet containing the PCGs, the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee particles. Examples of coffee-containing packets are well known in the literature. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 1,454,739 to C. B. Holland et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,531,594 to L. H. Abrams et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,183,096 to E. F. Hiscock et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,640,727 to M. R. Heusinkveld, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In those embodiments where instant coffee is included with the PCGs and the roasted and ground coffee, the instant coffee particles can be prepared by any convenient process. A variety of such processes are known to those skilled in the art. Conventionally, instant coffee is prepared by roasting and grinding a blend of coffee beans, extracting the roasted and ground coffee with water to form an aqueous coffee extract, and drying the extract to form “instant coffee.” Typical roasting equipment and methods for roasting coffee beans are described, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 1, pp. 203-226. Typical oil expelling equipment is described, for example, in Sivetz, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 2, pp. 27-30; typical grinding equipment is described, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, supra, pp. 239-250. Typical disclosures of equipment and methods which can be used for extracting coffee include: U.S. Pat. No. 2,562,206 to Nutting et al., Sivetz & Foote, supra, pp. 261-378; and U.S. Pat. No. 2,515,730 to Omfelt et al. Typical disclosures of spray drying processes which can be used to prepare instant coffee particles can be found, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 1, pp. 382-513; U.S. Pat. No. 2,771,343 to Chase et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,750,998 to Moore, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,469,553 to Hall. The instant coffee component can be any one of the commercially available instant coffees sold on the market, or combinations thereof. These include spray dried instant coffee powders, agglomerates and freeze-dried chunks. Examples of instant coffees useful herein include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,436,227 to Bergeron et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,493,388 to Hair, U.S. Pat. No. 3,615,669 to Hair et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,620,756 to Strobel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,637,397 to Menzies et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,293 to Lombana et al. The instant coffee used may be any single variety of coffee or a blend of different varieties. The instant coffee component may be regular or decaffeinated. The instant coffee may optionally be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic such as expresso, French roast, or the like. The roasted and ground coffee can be derived from low, intermediate or high quality coffee beans, or blends thereof. The roasted and ground coffee can be either decaffeinated or non-decaffeinated. PCGs can be added to straight or blended coffees of various degrees of roast. PCG usage level is determined by the effect desired. For example, for a blend of coffees where one component is roasted darker for a requisite flavor but incurs an increase in bitterness, PCGs can be added at higher levels to offset or minimize the increased bitterness. Low quality roasted and ground coffee beans have an undesirable or excessive bitter flavor that can be reduced by PCGs. Some lower quality coffee beans may also have a rather strong characteristic flavor that can become a flavor negative when used at too high of levels within a blend of coffees, i.e., the characteristic flavor becomes too dominant. PCGs can be added at a level to achieve the desired effect of modulating this characteristic flavor. Non-limiting examples of low quality beans include robustas, low grade naturals such as Haiti XXX, Peru Natural, Salvadors, low grade Brazils, and low grade unwashed Arabicas, such as the Ugandas, Indonesians, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Equador, Resacas and Guatemalan TMS. Processes for making decaffeinated and non-decaffeinated roasted and ground coffee are well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,935 to Kirkpatrick et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,573 to Stefanucci et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,821 to Morrison et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,262 to Wolfson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,263 to Patel et al., the disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference. Likewise, the composition of the invention can also be used by consumers to make a brewed coffee having a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. The coffee composition can be packaged the same as a conventional roasted and ground coffee for the consumer market. The composition does not leave an unpleasant adsorbent aftertaste in the brewed coffee and, most importantly, consumers can obtain the flavor benefit of the invention by conventional brewing methods—hot water extraction using conventional consumer brewing devices (e.g., percolators, electric percolators, drip coffee makers, automatic drip coffee makers). In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for making a composition of the present invention, the process comprising combining roasted and ground coffee and PCGs in a ratio of from about 200:1 to about 10:1. As discussed above, the PCGs can be combined with the roasted and ground coffee particles either after the roasted particles are ground, or during the grinding process itself. The PCGs can be combined with the roasted and ground particles to form a relatively homogeneous blend. Such a homogeneous blend is preferred when the product is to be sold as a bulk brewed coffee product (e.g., sold in traditional cans). Alternatively, the PCGs and roasted and ground coffee can be combined in a heterogeneous manner (e.g., two distinct layers). Such a heterogeneous blend would be useful where the coffee components are to be sold in a packet for brewing in a drip coffee maker. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a coffee concentrate, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention (i.e., containing PCGs) with water to generate a coffee concentrate; and (ii) collecting the concentrate for eventual packaging for distribution to a consumer. In the water extraction step, the water is preferably heated to a temperature of at least about 65° C. (149° F.). According to this process, the resulting coffee concentrate is in either liquid or solid form. The concentrate is then packaged for eventual distribution, where some additional processing (e.g., dilution) is required to provide a consumable beverage. The invention is still further directed to a process for making soluble coffee comprising contacting a coffee extract with PCGs described herein. In one embodiment for making soluble coffee, the PCGs and roast and ground coffee are added to counter current extraction columns so as to produce a coffee extract with a modulated flavor having reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. In an alternative embodiment, a coffee extract (e.g., derived from roast and ground hot temperature extraction) containing from about 5% to about 25% soluble coffee solids is first devolatilized by stripping away the flavor compounds. Then it is concentrated, preferably to from about 30% to about 50% soluble coffee solids, using methods commonly known to those skilled in the art. This concentrated extract is then contacted with PCGs prior to adding back flavor compounds and spray drying. Alternatively, a soluble coffee extract (e.g., derived from roasted and ground hot temperature extraction) is contacted with PCGs after first removing the volatile components. Then the devolatilized PCG-treated coffee extract is subject to a concentration process, the volatile compounds are added back and then dried. Yet another alternative is to devolatilize the initial coffee extract, then concentrate it to from about 30% to about 50% coffee solids, then add back the volatiles and then contact the complete mixture with PCGs before spray drying. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a brewed coffee beverage, the process comprising (i) contacting a roasted and ground coffee and PCGs with water to generate a brewed coffee; and (ii) collecting the brewed coffee for subsequent consumption. This process is most typically carried out using conventional drip coffee makers. In this process, a preferred embodiment is where the composition is subjected to high temperature extraction in step (i). In one embodiment, the roasted and ground coffee and the PCGs are combined in a single composition prior to being contacted with water. Alternatively, the roasted and ground coffee and the PCGs may be separate when contacted by the water. (For example, the two may be in separate compartments of a single package.) III. Test Methods—Moisture Content; Water Activity; and Lipid Content The moisture content of the PCGs is determined by a gravimetric method similar to Method Number 931.04 as described in the Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15 th Edition, 1990. A 10 g sample of the wet processed grounds is accurately weighed in an aluminum pan and dried to constant weight at 100° C. in an oven with air circulation. The water activity (ratio of vapor pressure of water in product to vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature) of the PCGs is determined by a method similar to Method Number 978.18, ibid. Here a Rotronic hygroscop® water activity meter made by Rotronic AG, Grindelstrasse 6, CH-8303 Bassersdorf, Switzerland, equipped with a WA40-TH constant temperature measuring cell, is used. Crude lipid content of the PCGs is determined by exhaustive extraction of the lipids based on Method Number 920.39 as described in the Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15 th Edition, 1990. Any one of the solvents—petroleum ether, hexane, chloroform, diethylether and methanol, or a combination thereof—can be used as the extraction solvent. IV. EXAMPLES Example 1 Roasted and ground coffee is further processed to provide functional benefits in a coffee matrix by the following batch preparation. 40 g of Folgers® French-Roast roasted and ground coffee is added to a Bunn™ model OL-35 commercial coffee machine's filter basket containing a paper coffee filter. The brew button is depressed and the coffee is automatically extracted in the typical manner. Upon completion, the soluble portion is discarded and the insoluble coffee grounds are obtained and transferred to a 4 L beaker. For the first extraction, these coffee grounds are further processed by addition of 1700 mL of distilled and deionized water. The contents are stirred using a large spatula to suspend the grounds, and then allowed to stand for several minutes to allow the coffee grounds to settle. Approximately ⅓ of the bulk liquid is then decanted off to remove the fines that have remained in suspension. The remaining grounds are once again resuspended in the remaining liquid by stirring with a spatula, and are immediately poured into a coffee basket that is supported by a stand and that contains a fresh coffee filter. The filtrate is allowed to drain and is discarded. The coffee grounds are again transferred to a clean 4-liter beaker. For the second extraction, 1700 mL of water is added and the procedure is repeated for a total of six extractions. After the sixth extraction, these further processed grounds are transferred from the filter paper and spread out in a 10-inch aluminum pie pan, for drying. The pan is placed in a Blue M™ Stabil-Therm fan-forced laboratory convection oven Model ESP-401C, held at 60° C. for 18 hours, then allowed to cool to room temperature. These further processed coffee grounds remain physically, microbially, and chemically stable when packaged in accordance with customary roasted and ground coffee products. The water activity of these processed coffee grounds is less than 0.85a w @25° C. and the moisture content is less than 9.72%. Example 2 A 2.5 g (5%) sample of the processed coffee grounds from Example 1 is put into a quart-size glass jar followed by 50 g of Folgers® French-Roast roasted and ground coffee. The jar is capped and shaken to mix the contents. The admixed coffee is placed into a Bunn™ model OL-35 commercial coffee machine's filter basket containing a paper coffee filter. The brew button is depressed and the coffee is automatically brewed in the typical manner. The resulting brewed coffee is less bitter, and has less off-flavor than a control coffee made in the same manner but omitting the dried processed coffee grounds. Example 3 A small slit is cut into Folgers® Singles coffee bag (sold by The Procter & Gamble Company) using an X-acto knife and 0.25 g (nominally 5%) of the processed coffee grounds from Example 1 is introduced into the coffee bag, containing nominally 4.42 g of a blend of ground and concentrated coffees. The bag is re-sealed using a Sealboy™ thermal package sealer type 235 SA from Packaging Aids Corporation with a sealing time set to 10. The bag is added to an eight ounce Styrofoam™ cup, boiling water is added and the contents are allowed to brew for 60 seconds. The bag is then dunked up and down for 30 seconds whereupon the bag is withdrawn from the beverage and discarded. The resulting beverage is less bitter and has a reduced coffee concentrate flavor as compared to a Folgers® Singles control made in a similar manner but without the processed coffee grounds. Example 4 Roasted and ground coffee can be further processed on a commercial scale to provide the functional benefits in a coffee matrix, using known commercial processes. Roasted and ground coffee is added to a battery of commercial percolation extractors known and used in the industry for preparation of soluble coffee extract, as described in Coffee Technology, Vol. 2, Chapter 5, Edited by R. J. Clarke and R.Macrae© (Elsevier Applied Science Publishers LTD (1987). The number of extraction columns in such batteries typically ranges from five to eight. These grounds can be made functional by processing as described, following the industrial practice of using higher feed water temperatures, up to 180° C. in a countercurrent fashion with the roasted coffee, i.e., the most exhausted coffee being contacted first. Typically the temperature of the liquor and grounds is then reduced to around 100° C. by the time the freshest grounds are contacted. The soluble extract from such processing can be subsequently dried as instant coffee. The remaining processed coffee grounds are removed from their respective columns and conveyed to a screw-press, known and used in the industry to effectively remove bulk water. The mechanical forces imposed on the coffee grounds by the screw-press reduces the moisture content from about 98% to about a 56%. The damp grounds are conveyed to a fluidized bed drier, and dried to a final moisture level of less than 9.72% with a water activity of less than 0.85a w @25° C. Drying conditions for a 6-inch static bed height of coffee grounds and an 18 to 20 minute residence time can be accomplished with an air inlet temperature of 86.10° C. and an air flux of 1.25 kg/m 2 /s. These dried grounds are physically, microbially, and chemically stable and can be transferred to appropriate storage facilities such as a silo, or they can be immediately packaged. Coffee grounds processed in this manner provide the intended functional benefit, when added to and packaged with customary roasted and ground coffee products, or when used on a commercial scale in the manufacture of instant-coffee or liquid coffee concentrates. Example 5 A coffee blend is prepared by mixing 10 g (30%) roasted and ground Arabican variety coffee beans with 23.3 g (70%) roasted and ground Robusta variety coffee beans. To this mixture (33.3 g) is added an additional 0.17 g (0.5%) of the processed coffee grounds from Example 4, and the mixture is blended well. The coffee mix is added to a Mr. Coffee™ model PRX23 0898 retail coffee brewer's basket containing a paper coffee filter and is brewed with 1420 mL of distilled and deionized water and a coffee beverage (designated as Coffee Beverage A) is obtained. Another coffee beverage (designated as Coffee Beverage B) is prepared from a 33.3 g of coffee blend comprising 50% roasted and ground Arabican variety coffee beans with 50% roasted and ground Robusta variety coffee beans. Coffee Beverage A, brewed with the dried processed coffee grounds, has a less bitter aftertaste, is a little more balanced, with slightly less strength as compared to Coffee Beverage B. Example 6 An instant coffee or coffee concentrate is prepared on a commercial scale using known commercial processes, by the addition of PCGs in the coffee matrix. A blend comprising roasted and ground coffee and 1.5% PCGs from Example 4 are added to a battery of commercial percolation extractors known and used in the industry for preparation of soluble coffee extract, as described in Coffee Technology, Vol 2, Chapter 5, Edited by R. J. Clarke and R.Macrae©, Elsevier Applied Science Publishers LTD (1987). The number of extraction columns in such batteries typically range from five to eight. Following industrial practices, the columns are operated in a counter-current mode, i.e., the most exhausted coffee in the extraction battery is contacted first with higher feed water temperatures, up to 180° C. Typically the temperature of the liquor and grounds is then reduced to around 100° C. by the time the freshest grounds are contacted. The liquid coffee extract concentrate, resulting from such processing and the starting coffee blend, will have a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. This liquid extract can be further concentrated if desired using known processes to remove bulk water, to produce a liquid coffee concentrate for commerce. Alternatively, the liquid coffee concentrate can be subsequently dried as an improved instant coffee having a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors.","6783791"

These applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a coffee roasting apparatus comprising a compartment for holding coffee beans; a roasting element for roasting the coffee beans in said compartment; and a controller for controlling the roasting element. The present invention further relates to a coffee brewing apparatus comprising such a coffee roasting apparatus. The present invention yet further relates to a method of roasting coffee beans, the method comprising heating the coffee beans to roast the coffee beans. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coffee has become one of the most popular beverages in modern society, with many different types and flavours of coffee being routinely available to a consumer, either in outlets such as coffee shops or in supermarkets for domestic use. The evolution of the popularity of coffee as a beverage has caused a shift in how coffee is being consumed, for instance in domestic settings. Whereas in the past coffee would be predominantly brewed from instant coffee granules or from packaged ground coffee powders, e.g. using domestic coffee makers such as espresso machines or filter machines, nowadays a greater emphasis is placed on the freshness of the brewed coffee, which has triggered a rise in popularity of coffee roasting apparatuses. In such an apparatus, fresh, i.e. green, coffee beans can be roasted by a thermal process, e.g. using hot gases or by physical contact with a hot surface. During roasting at temperatures above 170° C., water is redistributed, and complex chemical reactions such as Maillard reaction and pyrolysis are induced. A fresh coffee powder can then be formed by grinding the freshly roasted coffee beans, thereby facilitating the brewing of fresh coffee. Such coffee is typically considered to have a superior taste compared to coffee brewed from packaged ground coffee powders. The control of such a coffee roasting process is however far from trivial. Different users may require a different degree of roasting, e.g. a light roast or dark roast, of the coffee beans to cater for their personal taste. Moreover, different varieties of coffee beans will require different roasting times in order to achieve a certain roasting degree. Indeed, even different harvests of the same variety of coffee beans may exhibit variability in the required roasting times to achieve the desired degree of roasting. Therefore, one of the major challenges in providing a coffee roasting apparatus is to ensure that the roasted product meets customer expectation; e.g. has the desired degree of roasting. Existing coffee roasting apparatuses such as the Nesco® Model CR-1000 Series of coffee roasters allow the user to specify the roasting time of the coffee beans in order to achieve the desired roasting result. Other roasting apparatuses offer control over the roasting process by allowing the user to specify the roasting temperature. However, as indicated above, it has been found that the desired roasting degree cannot be consistently achieved by (only) controlling the roasting time and/or temperature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention seeks to provide a coffee roasting apparatus that may produce roasted coffee beans in a more consistent manner. The present invention further seeks to provide a coffee brewing apparatus comprising such a coffee roasting apparatus. The present invention yet further seeks to provide a method of roasting coffee beans in a more consistent manner. According to an aspect, there is provided a coffee roasting apparatus comprising a compartment for holding coffee beans; a roasting element for roasting the coffee beans in said compartment; and a controller for controlling the roasting element, wherein the controller is adapted to control the roasting element as a function of a rate of change in the total concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) residing in the compartment. The inventors have realized that in a coffee roasting process the variability in the time required to achieve the desired level of roasting is related to the variability in the time of first cracking of the coffee beans. This first cracking occurs as a result of heat-induced changes to the coffee bean structure including pore formation within the coffee bean, which is associated with a significant increase in the rate of release of VOCs from the coffee beans, leading to a rapid increase in the total concentration of VOCs within the compartment. After first cracking, the further roasting of the coffee bean has been found to be highly predictable using simple mathematical models. Therefore, by monitoring the rate changes in the concentration of VOCs and associating these changes with the first cracking of the coffee beans, improved control over the reproducibility of the coffee roasting process within the coffee roasting apparatus of the present invention is achieved. In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus further comprises a sensor for determining said total concentration, wherein the controller is adapted to control the roasting element in response to the sensor. The controller may be arranged to determine the rate of change of said total concentration from the sensor readings provided by this sensor. The controller may be responsive to said rate of change exceeding a predefined threshold. Such a rate of change exceeding the predefined threshold may be indicative of the start of a first cracking phase of said coffee beans. Alternatively or additionally, the rate of change exceeding a predefined threshold may be further indicative of the end of a first cracking phase of said coffee beans. Upon the completion of the first cracking phase, a negative rate of change in the total concentration of the VOCs is typically experienced as the total VOC concentration becomes more or less constant for a period of time between first and second cracking. Alternatively or additionally, the rate of change exceeding a predefined threshold may be further indicative of the start of a second cracking phase of said coffee beans, when a positive rate of change in the total concentration of the VOCs is typically experienced as the total VOC concentration increases again. This for instance may be used as a reference point if a deep roast of the coffee beans is required. The controller is typically adapted to control the roasting process in a predetermined manner after said rate of change exceeding the predefined threshold. Such a predetermined manner may include applying a predetermined roasting control profile to the heating element, e.g. based on the aforementioned simple mathematical models, to control the remainder of the roasting process in a predetermined manner. This for instance may include enabling the roasting element for a predefined time period. The coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a timer, wherein the controller is responsive to said timer for enabling the roasting element for the predefined time period. The timer may be separate to the controller or may form part of the controller. The coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a user interface for defining a degree of roasting of the coffee beans, the controller being responsive to the user interface. This allows a user of the coffee roasting apparatus to precisely define the desired degree of roasting of the coffee beans. In an embodiment, the compartment comprises an inlet; and the roasting element comprises a hot air source coupled to said inlet; the coffee roasting apparatus further comprising a stirring element mounted in said compartment for stirring the coffee beans during the roasting process. Such a hot air roasting process has been found particularly effective when combined with the VOC concentration rate change detection principle of the present invention. In accordance with another aspect, there is provided a coffee brewing apparatus including the coffee roasting apparatus according to one or more of the aforementioned embodiments. Such a coffee brewing apparatus benefits from the improved consistency of the coffee roasting apparatus, thereby providing a coffee brewing apparatus that can brew coffee with an improved consistency in taste. According to yet another aspect, there is provided a method of roasting coffee beans in a compartment of a coffee roasting apparatus, the method comprising heating the coffee beans to roast the coffee beans; monitoring a rate of change in the total concentration of volatile organic compounds in said compartment; and controlling said heating as a function of the monitored rate of change. Such a roasting method is capable of producing roasted coffee beans in a particularly consistent manner, providing excellent control over the level of roasting of the coffee beans. In an embodiment, said monitoring comprises detecting said rate of change exceeding a predefined threshold; and said controlling comprises controlling said heating for a predefined time period after detecting said rate of change exceeding the predefined threshold. The predefined threshold may be indicative of the start of a first cracking phase of said coffee beans; and/or the end of a first cracking phase of said coffee beans; and/or the start of a second cracking phase of said coffee beans. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Embodiments of the invention are described in more detail and by way of non-limiting examples with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIG. 1 schematically depicts a coffee roasting apparatus according to an embodiment; FIG. 2 schematically depicts an operating principle of the coffee roasting apparatus of FIG. 1; and FIG. 3 schematically depicts a flowchart of a coffee roasting method according to an embodiment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS It should be understood that the Figures are merely schematic and are not drawn to scale. It should also be understood that the same reference numerals are used throughout the Figures to indicate the same or similar parts. In the context of the present invention, VOCs are organic compounds, that have a defined minimum vapour pressure at room temperature (298K or 25° C.), e.g. organic compounds having a boiling point of less than or equal to 250° C., e.g. a boiling point in the range of 50-250° C. The total concentration of VOCs may be the total concentration of all VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 that can be detected by a VOC sensor or alternatively may be the total concentration of a selection of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 that can be detected by a VOC sensor, e.g. a VOC sensor capable of detecting said selection only. FIG. 1 schematically depicts a coffee roasting apparatus 100 according to an embodiment. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 typically comprises a compartment 110 for storing coffee beans 10 therein. The compartment 110 may further comprise a stirring arrangement including stirring members, e.g. agitating blades, 116 mounted on or otherwise affixed to a stirring bar 114 to stir the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process of the coffee beans. This stirring arrangement assists in ensuring a homogeneous roasting of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . The stirring arrangement may be controlled in any suitable manner, for instance by a controller 130 , which will be explained in further detail below. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 typically further comprises a roasting element (not shown) for roasting the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . The coffee roasting apparatus 100 further comprises a heating arrangement 140 for heating the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process. In an embodiment, the heating arrangement 140 may be controlled by the controller 130 . The heating arrangement 140 ensures that the coffee beans 10 are heated to an appropriate temperature at which the roasting of the coffee beans 10 takes place, i.e. an appropriate temperature at which the desired chemical reactions such as the Maillard reaction and pyrolytic reactions take place. In FIG. 1, the heating arrangement 140 is embodied by a hot air generator connected to an inlet 112 of the compartment 110 via a conduit 142 by way of non-limiting example only. In this embodiment, the inlet 112 is typically arranged such that the hot air is guided through the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process, e.g. when stirring the coffee beans 10 using the stirring arrangement. The inlet 112 may comprise a fine grid or the like to prevent coffee beans 10 from entering the conduit 142 . However, it should be understood that any suitable heating arrangement for heating the coffee beans 10 may be used, such as one or more heating elements attached to or integrated into the one or more walls of the compartment 110 , in which case the inlet 112 may be omitted. As such heating arrangements are well-known per se, they will not be explained in further detail for the sake of brevity only. The controller 130 is adapted to control the heating arrangement at least partially in response to a change in the rate at which the coffee beans 10 residing in the compartment 110 release VOCs during the roasting process, e.g. the rate at which the total concentration of VOCs in the compartment 110 changes. In an embodiment, in order to facilitate such a control mechanism, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may comprise a VOC sensor 120 for detecting such a total concentration of the VOCs in the compartment 110 . VOC sensors are well-known per se and are therefore not explained in further detail for the sake of brevity only. Any suitable VOC sensor may be used as the VOC sensor 120 . The controller 130 may be adapted to control the heating arrangement 140 in response to the total VOC levels detected in the compartment 110 by the VOC sensor 120 . In particular, the controller may be adapted to respond to an increase in the rate of change in concentration of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 signalling the occurrence of the first cracking phase. This will be explained in more detail with the aid of FIG. 2, which schematically depicts a typical VOC release curve during a roasting process of coffee beans 10 . The VOC release curve expresses the total concentration C of VOCs in the compartment 110 as a function of roasting time t. The curve can be divided into four distinct regions. The first region I is typically associated with the drying phase of the coffee beans 10 , during which the VOCs concentration in the compartment 110 is typically close to zero, and may increase only slightly if at all until the coffee beans enter the first cracking phase identified by region II, in which the VOC concentration in the compartment 110 rapidly increases as indicated by segment 11 of the VOC release curve, i.e. the rate of change of the total VOC concentration increases. Upon completion of the first cracking phase as indicated by point 12 in the VOC release curve, the rate of increase of the total VOC concentration in the compartment 110 is significantly reduced and may reach a zero or even slightly negative value during the third region as indicated by segment 13 of the VOC release curve. This steady state in the total VOC concentration is typically maintained until the coffee beans 10 enter the second cracking phase identified by point 14 in the VOC release curve, which second cracking phase as identified by region IV of the VOC release curve is typically characterized by a marked increase in the total VOC concentration in the compartment 110 . This predictable behaviour may be utilized to control the coffee roasting process in a predetermined manner upon the occurrence of one or more of these reference points in the VOC release curve in order to improve the consistency and/or quality of the roasting process. In an exemplary embodiment, the controller 130 is adapted to identify the start of the first cracking phase by monitoring the change in the total VOC concentration from the sensor readings provided by VOC sensor 120 in order to identify the start of the first cracking phase. The controller 130 may for instance compare the rate of change of the total VOC concentration against a defined threshold, and upon the rate of change of the total VOC concentration exceeding this defined threshold, the controller 130 may control the further roasting process in a predetermined manner, e.g. by controlling the heating arrangement 140 in a predetermined manner. This may for instance include controlling the heating temperature during the first cracking process of the coffee beans 10 ; during the first cracking process, the coffee beans 10 are subjected to exothermic reactions causing the internal temperature of the coffee beans 10 to rapidly increase, such that the amount of heat generated by the heating arrangement 140 may be reduced or otherwise controlled during the first cracking phase to avoid overheating, i.e. over roasting, of the coffee beans 10 during this phase. In an exemplary embodiment, the controller 130 is adapted to identify the end of the first cracking phase as identified by reference point 12 by monitoring the change in the total VOC concentration from the sensor readings provided by VOC sensor 120 in order to identify the end of the first cracking phase. The controller 130 may for instance compare the rate of change of the total VOC concentration against a defined further threshold, here a negative threshold as the end of the first cracking is signalled by the coffee beans 10 slowing the release of VOCs, and upon the rate of change of the total VOC concentration exceeding this defined further threshold, i.e. the rate of change dropping below this further threshold, the controller 130 may control the further roasting process in a predetermined manner, e.g. by controlling the heating arrangement 140 by a predetermined amount of time to complete the roasting process. The predetermined amount of time may depend of a desired degree of roasting as specified by the user of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 ; different roasting degrees may be associated with different amounts of time required to complete the roasting process from the end of the first cracking phase, as will be readily understood by a person skilled in the art. The controller 130 may be adapted to control the first cracking process in a predetermined manner as previously explained and subsequently control the remainder of the roasting process in a predetermined manner following the completion of the first cracking process as explained above. In an exemplary embodiment, the controller 130 is adapted to identify the start of the second cracking phase by monitoring the change in the total VOC concentration from the sensor readings provided by VOC sensor 120 in order to identify the start of the second cracking phase. The controller 130 may for instance compare the rate of change of the total VOC concentration against a defined threshold, and upon the rate of change of the total VOC concentration exceeding this defined threshold, the controller 130 may control the further roasting process in a predetermined manner, e.g. by controlling the heating arrangement 140 in a predetermined manner. The controller 130 may detect the start of the second cracking phase by first identifying the start of the first cracking phase and the end of the first cracking phase as previously explained, such that a subsequent increase in the rate at which the total concentration of the VOCs in the compartment 110 increases can be assigned to the start of the second cracking phase as indicated by point 14 in FIG. 2. For instance, the controller 130 may be adapted to continue the roasting process for a predetermined period of time and/or control the heating of the coffee beans 10 during the second cracking phase in a predetermined manner as previously explained in relation to the first cracking phase. The controller 130 of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be configured to control the roasting process in a predetermined manner as a function of the detection of the second cracking phase in scenarios in which a deep roast of the coffee beans 10 is required, as the second cracking phase is typically associated with such a deep roast. It is noted that the end of the second cracking phase is typically associated with a reduction in the rate of release of VOCs from the coffee beans 10 , such that the controller 130 may further be adapted to detect the end of the second cracking phase by detecting this reduction, e.g. by comparing the rate of reduction with a predefined threshold, and may be further adapted to complete the roasting process in a predetermined manner, e.g. by a predetermined amount of time, following the detection of the end of the second roasting phase. In an embodiment, the controller 130 may be adapted to select the appropriate reference point in the VOC release curve for controlling the roasting process in a predetermined manner from these reference point based on a user-specified desired roasting degree of the coffee beans 10 . For instance, where a user has indicated that the desired roasting degree is a light roast, the controller 130 may be adapted to control the remainder of the roasting process in a predetermined manner upon detecting the completion of the first cracking phase as previously explained. Alternatively, where a user has indicated that a desired roasting degree is a dark roast, the controller 130 may be adapted to control the remainder of the roasting process in a predetermined manner upon detecting the start and/or completion of the second cracking phase as previously explained. In an embodiment, the controller 130 may be adapted to engage the heating arrangement 140 for a set period of time upon completion of the first cracking process as detected by the aforementioned rate of total concentration changes in VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 . The set period of time may correspond to a user-defined degree of roasting of the coffee beans 10 , where a longer period of time typically corresponds to a darker roast of the coffee beans 10 . To this end, the controller 130 may include or may have access to a non-volatile data storage element such as a ROM or Flash memory, look-up table or the like (not shown) in which a time period is defined as a function of roasting degree. The controller 130 may further include a timer 135 for controlling the heating arrangement in accordance with the set period of time. Alternatively, the timer 135 may be separate to the controller 130 . As it is well-known per se to control a heating arrangement of coffee roasting apparatus 100 using time as a control parameter, this will not be explained in further detail for the sake of brevity only. It is simply noted that the time control aspect of the aforementioned embodiment may be implemented in any suitable manner. The controller 130 may be responsive to a user interface 150 , which for instance may facilitate a user specifying the desired roasting degree of the coffee beans 10 in any suitable manner, e.g. using a dial, a series of buttons, a programmable display, which may be a touch-screen display and so on. Any suitable type of user interface 150 may be used for this purpose. It will be understood that these embodiments are non-limiting examples of possible arrangements and that many other arrangements are equally suitable; for instance, even though the embodiment of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 as shown in FIG. 1 has been explained using a discrete controller 130 , it is equally feasible that at least some of the discrete components form part of a single arrangement. For instance, the controller 130 may form part of the VOC sensor 120 and so on. In an example embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be further adapted to control the roasting process by determining the color of the coffee beans 10 , for instance after completion of the first cracking phase of the coffee beans 10 as determined by the change in the aforementioned rate of total concentration changes in VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 . To this end, a further sensor (not shown) may be present in the compartment 110 , which further sensor is arranged to determine the colour of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . The further sensor is communicatively coupled to the controller 130 such that the controller 130 can further control the heating arrangement of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 in response to the further sensor. As the process of coffee bean colour determination is well-known per se, this will not be explained in any further detail for the sake of brevity only. It is simply noted that any suitable coffee bean colour determination sensing arrangement may be used. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be integrated in a coffee brewing apparatus further comprising a coffee bean grinder and a coffee brewing stage. For instance, the coffee brewing apparatus may be arranged to automatically transfer a portion of the roasted coffee beans into the coffee bean grinder for grinding, after which the ground coffee is automatically transported into the coffee brewing stage for brewing a fresh cup of coffee. As such coffee brewing apparatuses are well-known per se, this will not be explained in further detail for reasons of brevity only. It should be understood that the particular embodiment of such a coffee brewing apparatus is not critical to the present invention and that any suitable arrangement of such coffee brewing apparatus may be contemplated. An example embodiment of the coffee brewing method 800 according to the present invention will now be explained in further detail with the aid of FIG. 3, which depicts a flowchart of this example embodiment. The method starts in step 310 for instance with the switching on of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 and/or the filling of the compartment 110 with the coffee beans 10 to be roasted. The method then proceeds to step 320 in which a user defines the desired roasting level of the coffee beans 10 , for instance using the user interface 150 . In step 330 , the roasting process of the coffee beans 10 is engaged by enabling the heating arrangement 140 , during which roasting process the total concentration of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 is monitored by the VOC sensor 120 and interpreted by the controller 130 in step 340 in order to detect a reference point of interest during the roasting process, such as the beginning or end of the first cracking phase, the beginning or end of the second cracking phase and so on. It will be understood that although step 340 is shown as following step 330 , step 340 is typically executed in parallel with step 330 . The method then proceeds to step 350 in which the controller 130 checks if the rate of change in the total concentration of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 exceeds a predefined threshold as previously explained. If this is not the case, the method returns to step 340 and the monitoring is continued. However, if the controller determines that this rate of change has exceeded the predefined threshold, the method proceeds to step 360 in which the roasting process is continued in a predetermined manner, for instance by controlling the heat input into the coffee beans 10 during first cracking and/or by completing the roasting process in a predetermined amount of time, during which the heat input into the coffee beans 10 may be varied (in a predetermined manner) if necessary, which predetermined amount of time may be selected based on a user-specified desired roasting degree of the coffee beans 10 as previously explained. Once the coffee beans 10 have been roasted in this manner, the method terminates in step 370 . It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims. In the claims, any reference signs placed between parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claim. The word “comprising” does not exclude the presence of elements or steps other than those listed in a claim. The word “a” or “an” preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. The invention can be implemented by means of hardware comprising several distinct elements. In the device claim enumerating several means, several of these means can be embodied by one and the same item of hardware. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.","11019839"

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a coffee roasting apparatus comprising a compartment for holding coffee beans; a roasting element for roasting the coffee beans in said compartment; and a controller for controlling the roasting element. The present invention further relates to a coffee brewing apparatus comprising such a coffee roasting apparatus. The present invention yet further relates to a method of roasting coffee beans, the method comprising heating the coffee beans to roast the coffee beans. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coffee has become one of the most popular beverages in modern society, with many different types and flavours of coffee being routinely available to a consumer, either in outlets such as coffee shops or in supermarkets for domestic use. The evolution of the popularity of coffee as a beverage has caused a shift in how coffee is being consumed, for instance in domestic settings. Whereas in the past coffee would be predominantly brewed from instant coffee granules or from packaged ground coffee powders, e.g. using domestic coffee makers such as espresso machines or filter machines, nowadays a greater emphasis is placed on the freshness of the brewed coffee, which has triggered a rise in popularity of coffee roasting apparatuses. In such an apparatus, fresh, i.e. green, coffee beans can be roasted by a thermal process, e.g. using hot gases or by physical contact with a hot surface. During roasting at temperatures above 170° C., water is redistributed, and complex chemical reactions such as Maillard reaction and pyrolysis are induced. A fresh coffee powder can then be formed by grinding the freshly roasted coffee beans, thereby facilitating the brewing of fresh coffee. Such coffee is typically considered to have a superior taste compared to coffee brewed from packaged ground coffee powders. The control of such a coffee roasting process is however far from trivial. Different users may require a different degree of roasting, e.g. a light roast or dark roast, of the coffee beans to cater for their personal taste. Moreover, different varieties of coffee beans will require different roasting times in order to achieve a certain roasting degree. Indeed, even different harvests of the same variety of coffee beans may exhibit variability in the required roasting times to achieve the desired degree of roasting. Therefore, one of the major challenges in providing a coffee roasting apparatus is to ensure that the roasted product meets customer expectation; e.g. has the desired degree of roasting. Existing coffee roasting apparatuses such as the Nesco® Model CR-1000 Series of coffee roasters allow the user to specify the roasting time of the coffee beans in order to achieve the desired roasting result. Other roasting apparatuses offer control over the roasting process by allowing the user to specify the roasting temperature. However, as indicated above, it has been found that the desired roasting degree cannot be consistently achieved by (only) controlling the roasting time and/or temperature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention seeks to provide a coffee roasting apparatus that may produce roasted coffee beans in a more consistent manner. The present invention further seeks to provide a coffee brewing apparatus comprising such a coffee roasting apparatus. The present invention yet further seeks to provide a method of roasting coffee beans in a more consistent manner. According to an aspect, there is provided a coffee roasting apparatus comprising a compartment for holding coffee beans; a roasting element for roasting the coffee beans in said compartment; a controller for controlling the roasting element; and a sensor for monitoring a total amount of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) released by said coffee beans during roasting and providing the controller with an indication of said monitored amount; wherein the controller is adapted to receive an indication of the total weight of the coffee beans in the compartment and control the roasting element as a function of the indication of the monitored total amount of VOCs and an indication of the total weight of the coffee beans in the compartment, said function defining the total VOC release characteristics of said coffee beans during roasting. The present invention is based on the insight that the total amount of VOCs released per unit weight by the coffee beans varies in a consistent manner during roasting and as such can provide an accurate indication of the progress of the roasting process, such that the monitoring of this total amount, i.e. the sum of the amounts of various VOCs released by the coffee beans, can be used to accurately determine the degree of roasting of the coffee beans in the coffee roasting apparatus, such that the coffee roasting apparatus can be controlled using this parameter to produce consistent roasting results. The coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a user interface for specifying a desired degree of roasting, wherein the controller is responsive to the user interface and adapted to disable the roasting element if the received monitored amount corresponds to the total VOC release characteristics for the specified degree of roasting. This allows a user to specify the desired degree of roasting of coffee beans, which desired degree is typically related to the total amount of VOCs released per unit weight of the coffee beans, thus giving the coffee roasting apparatus greater flexibility as the apparatus can provide different degrees of roasting in a consistent manner. The coffee roasting apparatus may obtain the indication of the total weight of the coffee beans in a suitable manner. In an embodiment, the user interface is further arranged to provide the controller with a user-specified indication of said total weight. Alternatively, the indication of said total weight of the coffee beans in the compartment is provided by the sensor, and wherein the controller is adapted to derive the total weight from a point in time during roasting at which the rate of change of the total VOC concentration in the compartment exceeds a predefined threshold. The inventors have realised that the VOC release characteristics of the coffee beans can be used to identify certain points in the roasting process, such as the point of first cracking of the coffee beans. Moreover, the point in time during the roasting process at which such identifiable events in the roasting process occur, as indicated by the VOC released characteristics, is typically dependent of the total weight of the coffee beans in the compartment of the coffee roasting apparatus. Therefore, by monitoring the point in time at which a change in the rate at which the total amount of the VOCs are released by the coffee beans, the total weight of the coffee beans can be accurately estimated. Alternatively, the coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a weight sensor for providing the controller with the indication of the total weight of the coffee beans in the compartment. This provides an accurate determination of the total weight of the coffee beans in the coffee roasting apparatus, which enables particularly consistent roasting results. In an embodiment, the compartment further comprises a gas outlet conduit, and wherein the sensor is located in fluid connection with said conduit. This has the advantage that the sensor may operate on a relatively small volume in which the gases are concentrated, i.e. does not need to operate on the full volume of the compartment, thereby enhancing sensitivity. To further enhance the exposure of the sensor to the VOCs released by the coffee beans, the coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a pump arranged to force gases from the gas outlet conduit to the sensor. In an embodiment, the controller is adapted to calculate the cumulative amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans during roasting and to control the roasting element in accordance with cumulative amount, e.g. by calculating the area under the VOC release curve over time. It has been found by the inventors that this provides a particularly accurate indication of the progress of the roasting process as different batches of coffee beans may show some variation in the VOC release characteristics different points in time, but the overall amount of VOCs released during the roasting process is typically relatively constant. In a further embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus further comprises a timer for providing the controller with timing information during roasting, wherein the controller is adapted to determine a deviation of the measured total amount of VOCs from the expected total VOC release characteristics for a point in time during roasting; and control the roasting element in response to the determined deviation. This further increases the consistency of the roasting process as a particular roasting result may be obtained if the roasting process is controlled to ensure that the VOC release characteristics of the coffee beans during the roasting process exhibit a desired pattern, as such a pattern for instance is typically indicative of the rate at which the coffee beans are roasted. Therefore, by monitoring deviations of the intended pattern and adjusting the roasting process to counteract observed deviations, the accuracy of the roasting process is improved. The compartment of the coffee roasting apparatus may comprise an inlet; and the roasting element comprises a hot air source coupled to the inlet, wherein the coffee roasting apparatus further comprises a stirring element mounted in said compartment for stirring the coffee beans during roasting, wherein the controller is further adapted to control the stirring element. This may further improve the consistency of the roasting process as the controller may control the stirring element to control the heat transfer to the coffee beans. A further improvement of the consistency of the roasting process may be achieved if the coffee roasting apparatus further comprises a cooling element, wherein the controller is further adapted to control the cooling element in order to control the temperature of the coffee beans during the roasting process. According to another aspect, there is provided a coffee brewing apparatus including the coffee roasting apparatus of any of the above embodiments. Such a coffee brewing apparatus benefits from the improved consistency of the coffee roasting apparatus, thereby providing a coffee brewing apparatus that can brew coffee with an improved consistency in taste. According to yet another aspect, there is provided a method of roasting coffee beans in a compartment of a coffee roasting apparatus, the method comprising providing total VOC release characteristics for the coffee beans during roasting as a function of a total weight of the coffee beans; receiving an indication of the total weight of the coffee beans in said compartment; receiving an indication of a total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans during roasting; comparing the indication of the released total amount of VOCs against the provided total VOC release characteristics; and controlling the roasting of the coffee beans in accordance with said comparison. As explained above in more detail, by monitoring the total VOCs released characteristics of the coffee beans in the knowledge of the total weight of beans used in the roasting process, the degree of roasting of the coffee beans can be accurately controlled. The method may further comprise calculating the cumulative amount of VOCs released by said coffee beans during roasting; and wherein said comparing step comprises comparing the cumulative amount against the provided total VOC release characteristics in order to terminate the roasting process once the coffee beans have released a predetermined cumulative amount of VOCs during roasting. This provides a particularly accurate method of controlling the degree of roasting of the coffee beans. The method may further comprise controlling the roasting of the coffee beans in accordance with a deviation of the monitored total amount of VOC released by the coffee beans during roasting from the provided total VOC release characteristics. As explained above, as the time-dependent VOC release characteristics of an intended roasting process of the coffee beans tend to follow a consistent pattern, deviations from this pattern may be used to alter the roasting process such that it closely follows the intended roasting process, thereby further improving the consistency of the degree of roasting of the coffee beans.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS It should be understood that the Figures are merely schematic and are not drawn to scale. It should also be understood that the same reference numerals are used throughout the Figures to indicate the same or similar parts. In the context of the present invention, VOCs are organic compounds, that have a defined minimum vapour pressure at room temperature (298K or 25° C.), e.g. organic compounds having a boiling point of less than or equal to 250° C., e.g. a boiling point in the range of 50-250° C. The total concentration of VOCs may be the total concentration of all VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 that can be detected by a VOC sensor. FIG. 1 schematically depicts a coffee roasting apparatus 100 according to an embodiment. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 typically comprises a compartment 110 for storing coffee beans 10 therein. The compartment 110 may further comprise a stirring arrangement including stirring members, e.g. agitating blades 116 mounted on or otherwise affixed to a stirring bar 114 to stir the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process of the coffee beans. This stirring arrangement assists in ensuring a homogeneous roasting of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . The stirring arrangement may be controlled in any suitable manner, for instance by a controller 130 , which will be explained in further detail below. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 typically further comprises a heating arrangement for heating the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process. In an embodiment, the heating arrangement may be controlled by the controller 130 . The heating arrangement ensures that the coffee beans 10 are heated to an appropriate temperature at which the roasting of the coffee beans 10 takes place, i.e. an appropriate temperature at which the desired chemical reactions such as the Maillard reaction and pyrolytic reactions take place. In FIG. 1, the heating arrangement is embodied by a hot air generator 140 connected to an inlet 112 of the compartment 110 via a conduit 142 by way of non-limiting example only. In this embodiment, the inlet 112 is typically arranged such that the hot air is guided through the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process, e.g. when stirring the coffee beans 10 using the stirring arrangement. The inlet 112 may comprise a fine grid or the like to prevent coffee beans 10 from entering the conduit 142 . However, it should be understood that any suitable heating arrangement for heating the coffee beans 10 may be used, such as one or more heating elements attached to or integrated into the one or more walls of the compartment 110 , in which case the inlet 112 may be omitted. As such heating arrangements are well-known per se, they will not be explained in further detail for the sake of brevity only. The controller 130 is adapted to control the heating arrangement at least partially in response to a determined total amount of VOCs (C total ) released by the coffee beans 10 during roasting. This is based on the insight that the coffee beans 10 tend to release reproducible amounts of VOCs per unit weight of the coffee beans 10 during roasting (C unit ), with different amounts being released at different stages of the roasting process, such that the detection of a particular amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 at a particular point in time during the roasting process can be used as an indication of the progression of the roasting process if the total weight W of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 is (approximately) known, as indicated by equation 1: C total =C unit *W Equation 1 An example total amount of VOC release profile as exhibited by the coffee beans 10 during roasting is schematically depicted in FIG. 2. The VOC release curve expresses the total concentration C of VOCs in the compartment 110 as a function of roasting time t. The curve can be divided into four distinct regions. The first region I is typically associated with the drying phase of the coffee beans 10 , during which the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 into the compartment 110 is typically close to zero, as indicated by a close to zero total concentration, and may increase only slightly if at all until the coffee beans enter the first cracking phase identified by region II, in which the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 into the compartment 110 rapidly increases as indicated by segment 11 of the VOC release curve, leading to a rapid increase of the total concentration of the VOCs in the compartment 110 . It is noted that this sudden rate of change of the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 may also be correlated to the total weight of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 , as will be explained in further detail below. Upon completion of the first cracking phase as indicated by point 12 in the VOC release curve, the rate of release of VOCs by the coffee beans 10 rapidly decreases, such that the rate of increase of the total concentration of VOCs in the compartment 110 is significantly reduced and may reach a zero or even slightly negative value during the third region as indicated by segment 13 of the VOC release curve. This steady state in the total amount of VOCs concentration as caused by smaller amounts of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 during this stage is typically maintained until the coffee beans 10 enter the second cracking phase identified by point 14 in the VOC release curve, which second cracking phase as identified by region IV of the VOC release curve is typically characterized by a marked increase in the total VOC concentration in the compartment 110 due to an increase of the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 during this phase. As will be immediately understood by the skilled person, the above evaluation is based on a closed compartment 110 from which the VOCs cannot (rapidly) escape such that the total concentration of VOCs can be correlated to the total amount of VOCs present at any time in the compartment 110 . Obviously, where the VOCs are removed from the compartment 110 , e.g. by degassing the compartment 110 , the total concentration of VOCs in the compartment 110 is less relevant. However, the total amount of VOCs may still be accurately determined, for instance by monitoring the amount or concentration of VOCs in a degassing channel, such that the detected total amount of VOCs at a given point in time may be used to provide an estimate of the progress of the roasting process. In other words, the roasting process implemented by the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be controlled by determining an actual amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 at a certain point in time and by comparing the actual amount against an expected amount indicative of a particular point in the roasting process, e.g. a particular degree of roasting of the coffee beans 10 , such that the roasting process may be terminated upon the actual amount corresponding to the expected amount. In an embodiment, in order to facilitate such a control mechanism, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may comprise a VOC sensor 120 for detecting such a total concentration of the VOCs in the compartment 110 . VOC sensors are well-known per se and are therefore not explained in further detail for the sake of brevity only. Any suitable VOC sensor may be used as the VOC sensor 120 . In addition, the controller 130 is arranged to receive an indication of the total weight W of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 in order to determine the expected total amount of VOCs to be released by the coffee beans at a particular point of the roasting process, such that the controller 130 for instance may terminate the roasting process once the expected total amount of VOCs is actually released by the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 during roasting. For instance, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may further comprise a user interface 150 , which may be used by a user to provide the controller 130 with an indication of the total weight of coffee beans 10 inserted into the compartment 110 for roasting and/or a desired roasting degree of the coffee beans 10 . Any suitable type of user interface may be used for this purpose, such as one or more of a dial, a series of buttons, a programmable display, which may be a touch-screen display and so on. Alternatively, the controller 130 may retrieve an indication of the total weight of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 from the sensor signal received from the VOC sensor 120 . As explained above, the coffee beans 10 release the total amounts of VOCs, e.g. total concentration of VOCs, at different rates during different stages of the roasting process. As indicated in FIG. 2 for instance, a marked increase in the rate of release of VOCs is observed at the start of the first cracking phase of the coffee beans 10 . The point in time during the roasting process at which this marked increase occurs is a function of the total weight of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . This can be understood from the fact that the coffee beans 10 needs to absorb a certain amount of heat in order to crack, such that the total amount of heat absorbed by the coffee beans 10 before first cracking can occur is a function of their total weight. As the heating arrangement 140 produces heat at a fixed rate, the amount of heat absorbed by the coffee beans 10 at which first cracking occurs therefore equals the product of the heat output of the heating arrangement 140 per unit time and the amount of time at which the heating arrangement 140 has produced this heat output. Consequently, the controller 130 may monitor the point in time t during the roasting process at which the sudden increase in the rate of release of VOCs occurs, and may translate this point in time to an estimated total weight W est of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 as per equation 2: W est =W unit *t In equation 2, W unit is the unit coffee bean weight for which first cracking occurs after a unit time period. The value of W unit may be determined in any suitable way, e.g. empirically determined using suitable experiments. To this end, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may comprise a timer 132 to which the controller 130 is responsive in order to provide the controller 130 with the timing information required to estimate the total weight of the coffee beans 10 . In FIG. 1, the timer 132 is shown as a separate unit by way of non-limiting example; it will be understood by the skilled person that it is equally feasible that the timer 132 forms part of the controller 130 . In order to determine when to terminate the roasting process, the controller 130 typically has access to expected total VOC release characteristics per unit weight of the coffee beans 10 , which data may be incorporated into the controller 130 in the form of an algorithm or which data alternatively may be accessible in a data storage unit 135 , e.g. a non-volatile memory element or the like. Such data, i.e. the expected total VOC release characteristics per unit weight of the coffee beans 10 , typically expresses the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 at a particular point in time during the roasting process, e.g. the typical amounts of VOCs released by the coffee beans at a certain roasting degrees. The expected total VOC release characteristics during roasting of the coffee beans 10 may be obtained in any suitable manner, e.g. empirically obtained using suitable experiments. In an embodiment, the expected total VOC release characteristics are generally applicable, i.e. independent of a particular type of coffee bean. In an alternative embodiment, the expected total VOC release characteristics are specific to a particular type of coffee bean, in which case the user may indicate, e.g. using the user interface 150 , which type of coffee bean is to be roasted such that the controller 130 may accordingly select the appropriate expected total VOC release characteristics. Consequently, the controller 130 is typically arranged to compare the actual total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 as determined by the VOC sensor 120 against the data indicating the expected total VOC release characteristics such that the controller 130 may terminate the roasting process when the actual total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 matches the expected total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans for a particular roasting degree of the coffee beans. In an embodiment, the controller 130 may be arranged to detect an individual actual value of the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 and compare this detected individual actual value against an expected individual value in order to determine if the roasting process can be terminated. However, to avoid the premature determination of the roasting process, for instance because the coffee beans 10 may release the same total amount of VOCs at different points during the roasting process, the controller 130 may decide to terminate the roasting process only if certain waypoints during the roasting process as indicated by actual release characteristic of VOCs by the coffee beans 10 have occurred, such as the rapid rate increase in the release of VOCs during first cracking. This reduces the risk of premature termination of the roasting process. This risk may further be reduced if the controller 130 is arranged to determine the cumulative total amount of VOCs reduced by the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process, e.g. by determining the area under the total amount of VOCs release curve over time. As this yields a continuously increasing value as a function of time, every value is unique and a particular reference point in the roasting process such that premature termination of the roasting process may be avoided altogether. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 is adapted to obtain the estimated weight of the coffee beans 10 either from a user input or from the data provided by the VOC sensor 120 as previously explained. This has the advantage that no additional sensor is required, thereby reducing the cost of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 at the expense of potentially providing an approximate total weight only; for instance, the user may have provided an inaccurate total weight of the coffee beans 10 to be roasted or batch-dependent variations in the heat capacity of the coffee beans 10 may mean that the total weight of the coffee beans 10 as derived from the point in time of first cracking as explained above may also be approximate only. In order to achieve a guaranteed accurate determination of the total weight of the coffee beans 10 , the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may further comprise a weight sensor 125 , as schematically depicted in FIG. 3. The weight sensor 125 may cooperate with the floor 111 of the compartment 110 , e.g. the weight sensor 125 may include a resilient element, e.g. a spring or the like, which compression is a function of the load on the floor 111 . The degree of compression may be measured to determine this load, i.e. the weight of the coffee beans 10 . Other suitable embodiments of such a weight sensor will be apparent to the skilled person. As such weight sensors are well-known per se, this will not be explained in any further detail for the sake of brevity. It suffices to state that any suitable weight sensor may be used for this purpose. In the above embodiments, the VOC sensor 120 is located within the compartment 110 by way of non-limiting example as it should be understood that the VOC sensor 120 may be located in any suitable location in which the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 can be accurately determined. FIG. 4 schematically depicts a particularly suitable alternative arrangement in which the compartment 110 comprises a degassing channel 117 for removing gases from the compartment 110 , wherein the VOC sensor 120 may be in fluid connection with the degassing channel 117 , e.g. placed in the degassing channel 117 or in a chamber connected to the degassing chamber 117 as shown in FIG. 4. In order to force gases flowing through the degassing channel 117 towards the VOC sensor 120 , a pumping member 118 , e.g. a micro pump the like, may be placed in between the degassing chamber 117 and the VOC sensor 120 such that sufficient amounts of gases released from the compartment 110 through the degassing channel 117 can reach the VOC sensor 120 in order for the sensor to provide an accurate determination of the total amount of VOCs in the gases. Other arrangements are of course equally feasible, such as an arrangement in which the VOC sensor 120 is located in the degassing channel 117 and the pumping member 118 is located upstream or downstream from the VOC sensor 120 in the degassing channel 117 . In order to provide proof of concept, experiments were performed using Yirgacheffe and Guatemala Arabica coffee beans, in which different weights of coffee beans were roasted in accordance with the principles of the present invention, i.e. by terminating the roasting process upon the detection of a particular total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans. In these experiments, a medium roast of the coffee beans was targeted, which typically yields coffee beans having a bean surface colour of around 57 on the Agtron/SCAA coffee colour scale. TABLE 1 Roasting experiment details Terminating TVOC Bean Weight value Roasting Experiment Type (g) (ppm) colour 1 Yirgacheffe 50 2.4 57.4 2 Guatemala 50 2.4 56.7 3 Yirgacheffe 75 2.8 57.7 4 Guatemala 75 2.8 57.7 5 Yirgacheffe 100 3.4 56.4 6 Guatemala 100 3.4 57.9 As can be seen in Table 1, termination of the roasting process upon the total concentration of VOCs reaching the indicated expected amount yielded excellent consistency in the roasting results with all roasts achieving a roasting colour deviating less than 2% from their intended roasting colour, which is indicative of the different weights of different types of coffee beans all achieving very similar degrees of roasting. In the above embodiments, the controller 130 is adapted to terminate the heating arrangement 140 upon the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 reaching a certain expectation value, either by determining an individual total amount or a cumulative total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 as previously explained. However, in some embodiments, the controller 130 may further be adapted to track the total amounts of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 over time during the roasting process and to dynamically adjust the operation of the heating arrangement 140 in accordance with the tracked total amounts. More specifically, the expected VOC release characteristics of the coffee beans 10 over time, i.e. during the roasting process, may be indicative of the desired roasting profile to be applied to the coffee beans 10 , e.g. the rate at which the coffee beans 10 are heated in order to achieve the desired degree of roasting. To this end, the controller 130 may be adapted to compare the actual value of the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 at a certain point in time against the expected or desired value of the total amount of VOCs that this amount of coffee beans 10 at this point in time and to adjust the operation of the heating arrangement 140 if the actual value deviates from the expected or desired value. This is explained in more detail with the aid of FIG. 5, which schematically depicts an expected release curve 20 of the total amount of VOCs to be released by the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process and an actual release curve 30 of the coffee beans 10 during roasting. The total amount of VOCs is plotted on the y-axis and the amount of time lapsed during the roasting process is plotted on the x-axis. As can be seen, at the point in time around t=540 s, i.e. 9 minutes into the roasting process, the actual curve 30 significantly deviates from the expected curve 20 . This deviation may be used by the controller 130 to adjust the operation of the heating arrangement 140 accordingly. In the given example, as the actual amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 exceeds the expected amount, this is an indication of the coffee beans 10 being too hot, i.e. the roasting process is proceeding too quickly, such that the controller 130 may reduce the amount of heat produced by the heating arrangement 140 or at least the amount of heat transferred from the heating arrangement 140 to the coffee beans 10 , for instance by controlling the aforementioned stirring arrangement and/or by controlling a cooling element (not shown) for cooling the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . In the meantime, the controller 130 may continue the comparison between the actual value and the expected value of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 in order to monitor if the adjustments to the operation of the heating arrangement 140 have resulted in the actual value corresponding to the expected value, after which the operation of the heating arrangement 140 may be readjusted accordingly as will be understood by the skilled person. In an embodiment, the controller 130 is adapted to adjust the heating arrangement 140 if the aforementioned deviation exceeds a predetermined threshold to avoid the risk that the controller 130 constantly tries to adjust the operation of the heating arrangement 140 . In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may store a plurality of such expected release curves 20 , with different release curves corresponding to different degrees of roasting and/or different types of coffee beans, such that the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be accurately controlled by the controller 130 for a particular degree of roasting and/or a digital type of coffee bean in order to achieve particularly consistent roasting results. It will be understood that the aforementioned embodiments are non-limiting examples of possible arrangements and that many other arrangements are equally suitable; for instance, even though the embodiment of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 as shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4 has been explained using a discrete controller 130 , it is equally feasible that at least some of the discrete components form part of a single arrangement. For instance, the controller 130 may form part of the VOC sensor 120 and so on. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be integrated in a coffee brewing apparatus further comprising a coffee bean grinder and a coffee brewing stage. For instance, the coffee brewing apparatus may be arranged to automatically transfer a portion of the roasted coffee beans into the coffee bean grinder for grinding, after which the ground coffee is automatically transported into the coffee brewing stage for brewing a fresh cup of coffee. As such coffee brewing apparatuses are well-known per se, this will not be explained in further detail for reasons of brevity only. It should be understood that the particular embodiment of such a coffee brewing apparatus is not critical to the present invention and that any suitable arrangement of such coffee brewing apparatus may be contemplated. FIG. 6 depicts a flowchart of a method 200 of roasting coffee beans in a compartment 110 of a coffee roasting apparatus 100 according to an embodiment. The method starts in step 210 in which the coffee roasting apparatus 100 is initialized, e.g. by placing the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 , after which the method proceeds to step 220 in which the expected release curves of the total amount of VOCs to be released by the coffee beans 10 during roasting are provided; this step may be omitted if these release curves are already present in the coffee roasting apparatus 100 , for instance in the data storage element 135 or embedded in the controller 130 as previously explained. In an embodiment, step 220 may simply comprise the controller 130 accessing the appropriate release curve. The method 200 subsequently proceeds to step 230 in which an indication of the total weight of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 is provided, either by a user or by a sensor such as the VOC sensor 120 await sensor 125 as previously explained. Once the indication of the total weight of the coffee beans 10 is provided in this manner, the method proceeds to step 240 in which the roasting process of the coffee beans 10 is started under control of the controller 130 . During the roasting process, the total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 is monitored in step 250 , e.g. by using the VOC sensor 120 , and compared in step 260 against the expected total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 at a particular point in time as indicated in the release curve provided in step 220 , which step may further optionally comprise adjusting the operation of the heating arrangement 140 upon a deviation between actual VOC release value and expected VOC release value as previously explained. Next, it is checked in step 270 if the roasting process may be terminated, for instance because an individual or cumulative total amount of VOCs released by the coffee beans 10 has reached an expected value indicative of the coffee beans 10 having reached the desired degree of roasting. If this is not yet the case, the method reverts back to step 250 and continues to monitor the release of VOCs by the coffee beans 10 . If on the other hand it is determined in step 270 that the roasting of the coffee beans 10 has been completed, the method 200 proceeds to step 280 in which the roasting process is terminated. It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims. In the claims, any reference signs placed between parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claim. The word “comprising” does not exclude the presence of elements or steps other than those listed in a claim. The word “a” or “an” preceding an element does not exclude the presence of a plurality of such elements. The invention can be implemented by means of hardware comprising several distinct elements. In the device claim enumerating several means, several of these means can be embodied by one and the same item of hardware. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage.","10517422"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Historically, roast and ground coffee has been sold in one, two and three pound cans. One pound cans are considered the standard size. Coffee in a one pound can yields about 88 cups of brewed coffee. A one pound can has a volume of 1000 cc. Fast roasting processes reduce the density of roasted coffee and increase its extraction yield. Using fast roasting techniques, the industry standard for roast and ground coffee has become a 13-ounce coffee that yields about 88 cups of brewed coffee but has the same dry volume as traditional 16-ounce coffee. This new conventional 13-ounce coffee is marketed in cans having the same dimensions as the traditional one pound cans. The reduced density trend has been extended to 10.5- and 11.5-ounce coffee that has a dry volume and brew cup yield similar to 16-ounce coffee and 13-ounce coffee. Fewer coffee beans are required to make reduced density coffee. The reduced density coffee provides a cost savings to coffee manufacturers and consumers. Consumers get an equal number of cups of coffee from fewer coffee beans which the manufacturer can afford to sell for less than conventional roast and ground coffee. The density of roasted coffee beans and particulate coffee products is controlled by the roasting process. Reduced density coffee has increased extraction yields obtained by utilizing fast roasting processes. Higher density coffee, such as 16-ounce coffee, are obtained by utilizing slow roasting methods. Reduced density coffee technology has several drawbacks. There are limits below which roast and ground coffee can be easily packaged for sale. Coffee beans can be ""puffed up"" only so far to fill a 1000 cc container with a given weight of coffee. It is unlikely, for example, that a 6-ounce coffee (i.e., 6-ounces of coffee filling a 1000 cc volume can) could be produced using existing reduced density technology. Roasting conditions that are optimal for obtaining reduced density coffee are not necessarily optimal for flavor development. It is highly desirable to have a means for obtaining a particular coffee density which does not rely exclusively upon roasting parameters to achieve the that density. A means is required to optimize density which is independent of roasting conditions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides processes for making flowable compact coffee. Coffee granules and smaller coffee non-granules are admixed in critical weight ratios. The coffee granules include roasted and ground coffee. The coffee non-granules include flaked coffee, flaked coffee fines, ground coffee fines, coffee agglomerates, and mixtures thereof. The coffee granules and coffee non-granules are densified to form a flowable compact coffee. This invention is also directed to compact coffee. The compact coffee has a flowability, appearance, flavor and strength that is similar to that of conventional roast and ground coffee. The brew cup yield is from about 120 to about 200 cups per a 1000 cc dry volume of the compact coffee.

DEFINITIONS The terms used herein have the following definitions: A ""one pound can"" is a traditional coffee container having a 1000 cc holding capacity. ""10.5-ounce coffee"", ""11.5-ounce coffee"", ""13-ounce coffee"" and ""16-ounce coffee"" are roasted coffee products having densities such that 10.5, 11.5, 13 and 16 ounces (298, 327, 369 and 454 grams) of each product, respectively, has a dry volume of about 1000 cc. ""Density"" refers to ground tamped density unless otherwise specified. Ground tamped density is used to define densities of coffee granules and coffee non-granules. ""Brew cup yield"" is the volume of coffee brewed from 1000 cc of roasted coffee (cups of brewed coffee from a 1000 cc dry volume of roasted coffee). The brewed coffee contemplated by the term ""brew cup yield"" is one having a flavor, aroma and strength that is comparable to, or better than, that of conventionally brewed roast and ground coffee. ""Coffee granules"" are roast and ground coffee particles having an average particle diameter of from about 600 to about 3000 um (about 0.024 to about 0.118 inches). This includes conventional roasted coffee grinds such as regular, drip and fine grinds. ""Coffee non-granules"" are roasted coffee particles including coffee flakes, ground coffee fines, flaked coffee fines, coffee agglomerates and mixtures thereof. Flaked coffee fines and ground coffee fines have an average particle diameter less than about 600 um (about 0.024 inches). Flaked coffee has an average flake thickness of from about 102 to about 1016 um (about 0.004 to about 0.04 inches). Coffee agglomerates are agglomerated coffee particles including agglomerated ground coffee fines, agglomerated flaked coffee fines, agglomerated coffee flakes and agglomerated mixtures thereof. Coffee agglomerates have an average agglomerated particle diameter of less than about 600 um (about 0.024 inches). ""Flowable"" is the characteristic of particle compositions to be scooped or poured in a manner similar to that of conventional roast and ground coffee. All ratios and percentages as used herein are based on weight unless stated otherwise. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This process involves two procedures. One procedure is an admixing step in which coffee granules are combined with coffee non-granules in critical weight ratios. The other procedure is a densification step in which the combined particles are densified into a flowable compact coffee. The product and process of the invention, as well as preferred embodiments or elements, are described below. A) Admixing Coffee Granules with Coffee Non-granules Coffee granules are combined with coffee non-granules in the admixing step. The admixing step can occur before, after or concurrently with the densification step. The coffee non-granules are preferably coffee flakes, flaked coffee fines or ground coffee fines, most preferably coffee flakes or flaked coffee fines. The coffee flakes have an average flake thickness of from about 102 to about 1016 um (about 0.004 to about 0.04 inches), preferably from about 102 to about 508 um (about 0.004 to about 0.02 inches), most preferably from about 102 to about 254 um (about 0.004 to about 0.01 inches). In the admixing step, coffee granules are admixed with coffee non-granules in weight ratios (granules to non-granules) of from about 9:1 to about 0.67:1, preferably from about 3:1 to about 1:1. The weight ratios are critical to the flowability benefits and reduced densification times described hereinafter. At weight ratios less than about 0.67:1 the compact coffee lacks flowability. At weight ratios greater than about 9:1 the compact coffee requires excessive densification times. The admixing of coffee granules and coffee non-granules, when performed separately from the densification step described hereinafter, can be carried out by conventional processes used to admix dry solids. Non-limiting examples of suitable admixing devices include tumblers, ribbon mixers, Muller mixers, vertical screw mixers, turbine mixers or modified Muller mixers (i.e., mixers with rotating internal shells/devices). The admixing step also includes processes in which the coffee granules and coffee non-granules are generated and combined in a single operation. For example, admixing includes comminution processes in which roasted coffee beans or particles therefrom are reduced to a composition of coffee granules and coffee non-granules in the critical weight ratios received above. In the admixing step, some of the coffee non-granules will be reduced in size by shearing forces, however slight. Coffee flakes and coffee agglomerates are especially susceptible to this particle size reduction. The admixing step involves high shear admixing when performed concurrently with the densification step and low shear admixing when performed separately from the densification step. Coffee flakes remaining after low shear admixing will subsequently be reduced to flaked coffee fines during the densification step. Likewise, coffee agglomerates remaining after low shear mixing will subsequently be reduced in the densification step to an average particle diameter of substantially less than about 600 um (0.024 inches). The coffee granules and coffee non-granules are provided by conventional methods. B) Densification In the densification step, the coffee granules and coffee non-granules are densified into flowable compact coffee. The compact coffee has an increased brew cup yield of from about 120 to about 200 cups per 1000 cc. By densifying the coffee granules and coffee non-granules, less volume of the compacted coffee is needed to brew a cup of coffee. The weight of the compact coffee needed to make a cup of brewed coffee is unchanged by the densification step. Preferably, brew cup yields of the compact coffee are further increased to about 160 to about 200 cups per 1000 cc by using coffee granules or coffee non-granules having individually high extraction yields. In the densification step, coffee granules and coffee non-granules are densified to ground tamped densities of from about 0.41 to about 0.55 grams/cc, preferably from about 0.41 to about 0.51 grams/cc, most preferably from about 0.45 to about 0.51 grams/cc. This step increases ground tamped densities from about 0.03 to about 0.3 grams/cc, most typically from about 0.1 to about 0.2 grams/cc. Suitable densification devices include those typically used for intensive mixing, particle size modification or particle densification. These devices should provide high shear admixing in the form of high particle-particle interactions. Twin or single rotor mixers are two such devices. Single rotor mixers are preferred (i.e., Gump normalizer, BF Gump Co., Chicago, Ill.). These mixers consist of a shell with an internal, rotating shaft. The shaft has paddles which induce mixing. The shaft rotates at about 100 to 5000 revolutions per minutes. Single rotor mixers provide the maximum impact short of a grinding mill. Twin rotor mixers can be used. These mixers have two rotating shafts with attached paddles inside a shell. Twin rotating screws can be used in place of the rotating shafts and attached paddles. Preferably, the coffee granules and coffee non-granules being densified are maintained in a cool environment, preferably less than about room temperature. The cooler temperatures can be achieved by jacketing the densification device in a low temperature medium or operating the device in a low temperature environment. The time needed to densify the composition of coffee granules and coffee non-granules in the critical weight ratios recited herein is from about 1 second to about 5 minutes, more typically from about 1 second to about 2 minutes, most typically from about 1 second to about 1.5 minutes. The times will vary within each range among the different densification devices. The times for a particular device are easily determined by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. The time will also vary within each range depending on the ground tamped density desired (from about 0.41 to about 0.55 grams/cc). The time will also depend on the weight ratios of coffee granules and coffee non-granules being densified. 100% flaked coffee can be densified to between about 0.41 and about 0.55 grams/cc in about 1 second to about 2 minutes. 100% coffee granules require from about 3 to about 12 minutes to achieve densities of from 0.41 to about 0.47 grams/cc. Fast roasted coffee granules typically cannot be densified beyond about 0.47 grams/cc. The densification times were surprisingly short for the compact coffee containing coffee granules and coffee non-granules in the critical weight ratios recited herein. The FIGURE is a graph of ground tamped densities achieved over time for various coffee products in a Gump normalizer. Such products include flaked coffee having an average flake thickness of about 127 um (line A), roast and coarsely ground coffee having an average particle diameter of about 1000 um (line D), conventional roast and ground coffee having an average particle diameter of about 825 um (line C), and a blend of the coarsely ground coffee and the flaked coffee in a 1:1 weight ratio (line B). The time needed to reach a 0.465 grams/cc density, for example, was 20 seconds for the flaked coffee, 6 minutes for the conventional roast and ground coffee, 12 minutes for the coarsely ground coffee, and only about 30 seconds for the 1:1 blend. For a density of 0.465 grams/cc, the densification time for the 1:1 blend was 1/10th that of the conventional roast and ground coffee and 1/24th that of the coarsely ground coffee. Similar relationships can be seen for ground tamped densities from about 0.41 to about 0.55 grams/cc. Similar relationships can also be seen when other densification devices are used although absolute densification times will vary. These shorter densification times result in substantial benefits to the compact coffee. Manufacturing operations are more efficient; i.e., fewer densification devices are needed. Also, less heat is generated within the densification device. Less heat means less heat-induced aroma loss in the coffee being densified. There is also less heat-induced agglomeration. This agglomeration results in sticky coffee masses that hamper manufacturing operations. Less heat also reduces the need to provide a low temperature environment around the coffee being densified. Preferably, the coffee granules are derived from fast roasted coffee means having whole roast tamped densities of from about 0.28 to about 0.38 grams/cc. These coffee granules have ground tamped densities of from about 0.32 to about 0.41 grams/cc. It was found that these coffee granules have reduced densities due mostly to an expansion of inter-granule voids. This is contrary to the prior art which teaches that coffee granules from fast roasted beans have reduced densities due mostly to an expansion of intra-granule voids. In view of this finding, coffee non-granules can be filled into the inter-granule voids. It was also found that the fast roasted, low density coffee granules have a typically high extraction yield even after densification into a compact coffee. The fast roasted beans are obtained by conventional fast roasting processes. Coffee beans are roasted at temperatures of from about 350° to about 1200° F. (about 177° to about 649° C.) for less than about 5.5 minutes, preferably from about 400° to about 800° F. (about 204° to about 427° C.) for from about 10 seconds to about 5 minutes. The fast roasted beans have Hunter L-colors of from about 16 to about 24, preferably from about 16 to about 20. These beans are then cooled and ground into the reduced density coffee granules. Fast roasting processes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,590 to Price et al., issued Jan. 29, 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,376 to Brandlein et al., issued Apr. 12, 1988; U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,164 to Hubbard et al., issued Sep. 25, 1979; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,322,447 to Hubbard, issued Mar. 30, 1982, which patents are herein incorporated by reference. Roasting methods and equipment are disclosed in in Sivetz, Coffee Technology, AVI Publishing Company, Westport, Conn. 1979, pp. 226-246, which is incorporated herein by reference. It was also found that the compact coffee has an aroma level similar to that of roast and ground coffee. This aroma benefit was surprising since the compact coffee comprises from about 10 to about 60% densified coffee non-granules. It is known that these coffee non-granules have lower levels of aroma. Coffee aromas are measured by Gas Chromatography (GC) as total GC counts. Total GC counts for the compact coffee are from about 30,000 to about 75,000 counts, typically from about 40,000 to about 65,000 counts. Total GC counts for conventional roast and ground coffee are from about 25,000 to about 45,000 counts. Total GC counts for flaked coffee, flaked coffee fines, ground coffee fines, coffee agglomerates, and mixtures thereof are from about 10,000 to about 20,000 counts. The total GC counts recited above are for non-vacuum packed coffee. It was also found that the compact coffee has an aroma that is superior to that of either 100% densified coffee granules or 100% densified coffee non-granules. For example, when a coffee product is densified to 0.465 grams/cc, the total GC counts are about 20,000 counts for flaked coffee fines, about 40,000 counts for roast and coarsely ground coffee (average particle diameter of about 1000 um before densification), and about 55,000 counts for a 1:1 (weight ratio) blend of the flaked coffee fines and the roasted and coarsely ground coffee. Flaked coffee fines have lower GC counts even before densification. Coarsely ground coffee have lower GC counts due to longer densification times. The longer times result in more heat-induced aroma loss during densification. The 1:1 blend, however, has higher GC counts due to shorter densification times which result in less heat-induced aroma loss. The compact coffee is preferably packaged and sealed under non-vacuum conditions. Such conditions provide a compact coffee with about 10 to about 20% higher total GC counts. It was also found that the compact coffee has an appearance and flowability similar to that of conventional roast and ground coffee. This was was surprising since the compact coffee comprises from about 10 to about 60% densified coffee non-granules. It is known that coffee non-granules, especially when densified, have a powder-like appearance and poor flowability. C) Flowable, Compact Coffees A 1000 cc dry volume of the compact coffee weighs from about 426 to about 540 grams (about 15 to 19 ounces). The compact coffee can be packaged in one, two or three pound cans and marketed as 15- to 19-ounce coffee. The one pound can will deliver from about 120 to about 200 cups of brewed coffee. The three pound can will deliver from about 360 to about 600 cups of brewed coffee. The compact coffee can also be packaged in smaller containers. For example, 8 ounces (227 grams) of the compact coffee could be packaged in 500 cc containers. It would deliver the same brew cup yield as a 1000 cc dry volume of a conventional roast and ground coffee. The flavor, aroma and strength of coffee brewed from the 500 cc compact coffee would be comparable to, or better than, that of the 1000 cc conventional roast and ground coffee. The compact coffee can be combined with soluble coffees or admixed with non-coffee materials. It can be caffeinated or decaffeinated. It can also be added to filter packs or used to manufacture soluble coffee. Soluble coffee particles can be compacted with the coffee non-granules. F. Test Methods 1) Tamped Densities Whole roast tamped densities represent the densities of roasted coffee beans. Whole roasted coffee beans (200 grams) are vibrated by conventional means in a 1000 ml graduated cylinder for 30 seconds. The volume of beans are then measured to the nearest 5 ml graduation. The whole roast tamped density is determined by dividing the weight of the coffee (grams) by the volume (cc's) occupied by the beans in the cylinder after vibrating. Ground tamped densities represent the densities of roasted coffee particles including coffee granules and coffee non-granules. The method is the same as that for whole roast tamped densities except that 300 grams of the particles are vibrated in the graduated cylinder and the vibrating continues for 1 minute. 2) Coffee Aroma Levels As used herein, coffee aromas are measured via gas chromatography. The flame ionization gas chromatograph analytical measurement herein measures the total content of organic compounds in a gas headspace or voidspace sample from packaged coffee on a scale of relative intensity. The scale is graduated in microvolt-seconds (referred to herein as ""counts"") which is a measure of the area under the intensity curve, and the result is reported as an integration of the total area under the curve in total microvolt-seconds (""total counts""). The gas chromatograph comprises a 36 inch chromosorb WAW (acid washed) 60/80 mesh column of 1/4 in. diameter and is housed in an oven section for isothermal temperature control. A Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph (Model 700), electrometer (Model 5771A), integrator (Model 3370A), and recorder (Model 7127D), range 0-5 mv. and temperature controller (Model 220) were used. Each peak is measured in counts, the counts being first measured by the flame detector and then both integrated and recorded. The number of counts for a particular component is directly proportional to the number of milligrams of that component in the vapor sample. The coffee sample is packed under atmospheric pressure and held for 14 days at 75°±5° F. (24±3C) before sampling. The non-vacuum package, now under pressure after 14 days, is punctured and the package pressure allowed to fall to atmospheric pressure before resealing the non-vacuum package. The resealed package is allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour at 75°±5° F. (24±3C) to allow aroma phase equilibration. After equilibration, a 1.0 cc sample of the aromatic atmosphere of the canister headspace/voidspace is taken and injected into the inlet port of the gas chromatograph. Resulting GC counts are corrected for temperature and pressure. 3) Roast Colors of Coffee Beans The Hunter color scale system defines the color of coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. The Hunter color scale system is described in an article by R. S. Hunter, ""Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,"" Journal of the optical society of America, 48, 985-95 (1958), and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,003,388 to Hunter et al., issued Oct. 10, 1961. Both references are incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to improvements in devices and systems for brewing coffee or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved coffee brewer utilizing streams of heated water for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds, to yield brewed coffee having improved flavor and enhanced aroma and other characteristics. Drip-style coffee brewers are available in a wide range of different configurations and sizes for use in residential or commercial environments to produce brewed coffee. Such coffee brewers commonly include a water reservoir from which a controlled volume of water is heated and then dispensed downwardly by dripping or spraying onto coffee grounds contained within an underlying, upwardly open brew basket. The hot water intermixes with the coffee grounds to produce the desired brewed coffee beverage which is drained from the brew basket through a filter element into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In one common form, the brewer includes a refillable water reservoir from which the water is delivered through a heating element for drip-flow dispensing into the brew basket. Alternately, the brewer may be coupled directly to a tap water supply or the like. While drip-style coffee brewers of the above described type have been used extensively for many years, the flavor and other characteristics of the brewed coffee is inconsistent and, in many cases, can be of marginal or unacceptable quality. Such problems are believed to stem from inadequate and/or inconsistent intermixing of the hot water with the coffee grounds contained in the brew basket, resulting in brewed coffee exhibiting inconsistent flavor and body traits, often including unacceptable bitter taste attributes. In this regard, the downward dispensing of hot water onto the initially dry coffee grounds in the underlying brew basket can produce erosion-type channels through the coffee grounds, wherein such channels can permit a significant portion of the water volume to pass through the coffee grounds and drip from the brew basket without significantly wetting or otherwise adequately intermixing therewith. While this channeling problem can sometimes be mitigated by carefully pre-distributing the coffee grounds substantially uniformly within the brew basket, significant attention to this aspect of the coffee brewing process is seldom given. A variety of modified coffee brewers and related brewing processes have been provided in an attempt to overcome these problems and disadvantages by providing improved intermixing between the heated water and the coffee grounds within a filtered brew basket. In general, such concepts utilize mechanical stirring devices for improving thorough contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds. While such concepts may provide brewed coffee with enhanced and/or more consistent flavor characteristics, they inherently incorporate moving parts that increase the overall complexity and cost of the coffee brewer, and are susceptible to occasional break-down to require periodic repair or replacement. There exists, therefore, a continuing need for further improvements in and to coffee brewers and related coffee brewing processes for achieving significantly improved intermixing between heated water and coffee grounds, for providing brewed coffee of consistent high quality and improved flavor and other desirable attributes, without requiring mechanical stirring devices and their attendant disadvantages. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, an improved coffee brewer and brewing method are provided for producing brewed coffee with improved flavor. The coffee brewer includes a removably mounted brew basket having jet ports connected to a source of heated water and positioned to deliver hot water streams into the brew basket at a location for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds contained therein to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds for improved flavor extraction. This fluidized bed is directed against one or more mesh filter elements forming a wall portion of the brew basket for outward passage of the thus-produced coffee which is then directed into an underlying carafe or the like. In one preferred form, the coffee brewer includes a water reservoir coupled via a first check valve for flow in heat transfer relation with a heating unit. The heating unit elevates the temperature of the water substantially to the boiling point, whereupon the heated water flows through a second check valve to the brew basket. The heated waterflows to and through the jet ports into the interior of the brew basket, with at least some of the jet ports being disposed at a position beneath the level of coffee grounds contained therein. As a result, the heated water is jetted or sprayed into and thoroughly wets the coffee grounds with an agitating and stirring action that is effective to lift, suspend, and turbulently stir the grounds in a manner to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne grounds. In the preferred form, the jet ports are oriented for rotationally stirring the coffee grounds with a substantial spinning or orbital path of motion. The fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds provides improved and consistent intermixing of the heated water with the coffee grounds for enhanced flavor extraction with minimal bitter and/or other undesirable attributes. This spinning fluidized bed is directed by centrifugal action in a generally radially outward direction against an inboard side wall of the brew basket, a portion of which is defined by the mesh filter element or elements which permit outward flow-through passage of the brewed liquid coffee while substantially preventing outward passage of the coffee grounds. The brewed coffee passed through the filter element or elements is directed further as by gravity flow into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention, a frontal portion of the brew basket side wall comprises a substantially transparent window visible from the exterior of the coffee brewer, when the brew basket mounted is thereon. During a brewing cycle, the spinning fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket is thus externally observable. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As shown in the exemplary drawings, an improved coffee brewer referred to generally in FIGS. 1-6 by the reference numeral 10 is provided for rapid and consistent high quality brewing of coffee. The coffee brewer 10 includes a brew basket 12 (FIGS. 4-10) for receiving a selected quantity of ground coffee (not shown). In accordance with a primary aspect of the invention, the brew basket 12 is adapted for connection to a source of heated water, and includes at least one and preferably a plurality of jet ports 14 (FIGS. 7 and 9- 11 ) positioned for agitating and turbulently stirring the coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of suspended and water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket 12 . This fluidized bed results in substantially improved and intimately thorough wetting contact and intermixing between the hot water and the coffee grounds, for achieving enhanced flavor extraction to consistently produce a high quality, fuller-bodied and more robust coffee beverage. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention is shown generally in one preferred form in FIGS. 1-6. As depicted, the coffee brewer 10 comprises a relatively compact base 16 having a platen 18 formed or carried thereon with a size and shape suitable for secure rested support of a coffee pot 20 such as a carafe or decanter or the like. An on-off button 22 is exposed at a front side of the base 16 and may be depressed manually when brewing of a pot of coffee is desired, as will be described in more detail. A power cord 24 (FIG. 1) protrudes rearwardly from the base 16 for connecting the brewer 10 to a suitable electrical power source. A support post 26 extends upwardly from a rear side of the base 16 to support an upper brewer head 28 in a positioned generally cantilevered over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 supported on the base platen 18 . In general terms, the brewer head 28 comprises a relatively compact housing structure defining a water reservoir 30 (FIGS. 3-4) for receiving a selected volume of water for use in brewing a pot of coffee, in combination with an upwardly open cavity 32 (FIGS. 4-6) for removably supporting the brew basket 12 . Upon depression of the on-off button 22 , water within the reservoir 30 is delivered in heat exchange relation with a heating unit 34 shown mounted within the base 16 as viewed in FIG. 6, and further to the brewer basket jet ports 14 for delivery into the interior of the brew basket 12 in the form of a plurality of pressurized or jetted hot water streams. These hot water jets turbulently stir and intermix with coffee grounds contained within the brew basket 12 to produce the fluidized bed or suspension of coffee grounds within a spinning and swirling body of water within the brew basket, to produce the improved, high quality, and consistent coffee beverage in accordance with the invention. This coffee beverage is filtered and delivered from the brew basket to the underlying coffee pot or carafe 20 , ready for immediate use and enjoyment. More particularly, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 3-6, the illustrative brewer head 28 includes an upper housing bowl 29 with an internal, generally vertically oriented divider wall 36 subdividing the brewer head 28 into the upwardly open water reservoir 30 occupying a rearward region of the head 28 , and the brewer basket cavity 32 at a forward region of the head 28 . A rear hinged lid 38 is provided on the brewer head 28 for normally closing the water reservoir 30 , but this lid 38 is adapted for quick and easy pivoting movement to an open position (as viewed in FIGS. 34) to permit a selected volume of water to be poured into the reservoir 30 . In a typical residential coffee maker, the reservoir 30 may be sized for receiving a standardized volume of water, such as a water volume sufficient to brew a standardized volume of coffee, such as 8, 10 or 12 cups. Alternately, the brewer head 28 may include volumetric gradation marks (not shown) indicating the volume of water contained therein, to facilitate brewing of different selected volumes of coffee. As a further alternative, persons skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the coffee brewer 10 may be connected directly to a tap water source or the like, in lieu of the reservoir 30 for pour-in reception of a selected water volume. The upper housing bowl 29 defining the water reservoir 30 is mounted on a lower housing shell 39 (shown best in FIGS. 5-6) which is supported at an upper end of the support post 26 in cantilevered relation spaced above the base 16 . Water within the reservoir 30 is coupled through a port 40 formed in a bottom wall of the upper bowl 29 (FIG. 6) to an underlying receiver 44 which is mounted on the lower shell 39 within a compartment 46 defined cooperatively between the upper bowl 29 and lower shell 39 . This receiver 44 may include a spring-loaded valve positioned for engagement by the upper bowl 29 for movement to an open position permitting downward water flow from the reservoir 30 , when the upper bowl 29 is mounted on the lower shell 39 . Such downward water flow proceeds through the receiver 44 and further through a short supply conduit 48 (FIGS. 5-6) which couples the water downflow to a passage 50 formed in the support post 26 and further to the heating unit 34 . A first check valve 45 (FIG. 6) is mounted along this passage 50 within the support post 26 to permit water downflow, but to prevent upward backflow from the heating unit 34 toward the reservoir 30 . The heating unit 34 , although depicted generally in FIG. 6 by dofted lines, comprises a standard dual pathway device of the type known in the art for use in coffee brewers. In particular, the heating unit 34 incorporates an electrical resistance heating element mounted within one annular pathway and disposed in heat transfer relation with water flow through an adjacent annular pathway. One exemplary dual pathway heating unit of this general type is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,956, which is incorporated by reference herein. With this construction, the water downflow through the post passage 50 is circulated though the water pathway of the heating unit 34 which heats the water substantially to boiling. A downstream end of the water pathway through the heating unit 34 is coupled to a second flow passage 52 (FIG. 6) for upward or return flow to the brewer head 28 . The upward return flow passage 52 through the support post 26 delivers the heated water through a short transition conduit 54 to an inverted, generally U-shaped turn 56 positioned within the water reservoir 30 and disposed at least slightly above a maximum fill level of the reservoir. This inverted and elevated conduit turn 56 prevents water within the reservoir 30 from draining past the turn 56 when the reservoir is filled with water. A downstream end of the inverted conduit turn 56 is coupled by an additional supply conduit 58 to a second check valve 60 mounted at the underside of the upper bowl 29 to permit one-way flow-through passage of water from the supply conduit 58 to brew basket 12 , but prevents backflow of water to the conduit 58 . More particularly, the second check valve 60 is positioned in aligned relation with an inflow port 62 (FIGS. 3 and 6) formed in the bottom wall of the upper housing bowl 29 , at a location generally centered within the brew basket cavity 32 . In this regard, as shown best in FIGS. 8 and 10, the brew basket 12 includes a downwardly open feed port 64 having a size and shape for seated reception on the underlying inflow port 62 , when the brew basket 12 is positioned within the brew cavity 32 . This feed port 64 communicates water inflow from the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 of the brew basket 12 . The brew basket 12 may comprise a generally bowl-shaped component constructed primarily from lightweight molded plastic or the like, to provide a generally upwardly open geometry defined by a bottom wall 66 joined to an upstanding side wall 68 of generally cylindrical configuration. The bottom wall 68 is formed to include the downwardly open feed port 64 for communicating hot water inflow upwardly into a false bottom or plenum chamber 70 (FIG. 10) which distributes the hot water flow to at least one and preferably a plurality of hollow ribs 72 formed in the side wall 68 . In the preferred configuration as shown, three of said hollow ribs 72 are formed in the side wall 68 at approximate 120° intervals, and each of these ribs 72 includes a closed upper end and has at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed along the height thereof forjetting hot water streams into the interior of the brew basket 12 . FIGS. 6-7 and 9 - 10 illustrate each hollow rib 72 with a pair of vertically spaced jet ports 14 positioned and aimed for jetting water streams generally tangentially in a common swirling direction (clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 9) into the brew basket interior. At least the lower jet ports 14 on the hollow ribs 72 are positioned at a level below a normal level or upper surface of a bed of dry coffee grounds placed into the brew basket 12 for brewing coffee, as indicated approximately by the dotted line 74 in FIG. 10. Thus, when the hot water is jetted through the jet ports 14 , at least a portion of the hot water stirs and agitates the body of coffee grounds to initiate a swirling or spinning action to create the fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. That is, upon initial supply of hot water into the brew basket 12 , water passing through the lower jets 14 stirs and agitates the initially dry coffee grounds, whereas the upper jets may be disposed above the upper surface of the coffee grounds and thereby initially spray onto and wet that upper surface. As hot water flow continues, the brew basket 12 gradually fills substantially with water, while the agitating and stirring action of the lower jets continues. As the brew basket fills with water, the water level eventually increases to a point higher than the upper jets 14 , as indicated approximately by the dotted line 76 in FIG. 10, whereby the upper and lower jets 14 cooperatively stir and agitate the combined body of coffee grounds and water to suspend and swirl the coffee grounds in the form of a water-borne fluidized dispersion. Such action exposes the entire volume of the coffee grounds to the heated water thoroughly and substantially uniformly, and for substantially for the entire period of the brew cycle, to result in a significantly improved and consistently high quality brewed coffee beverage. A removable cap 77 is normally provided to close the top of the brew basket 12 and thereby prevent undesired spilling of water or coffee grounds therefrom during the brewing procedure. In one preferred form as illustrated in FIG. 11, the jets ports 14 formed along the hollow ribs 72 of the brew basket 12 may be designed for minimizing or eliminating undesirable inflow or ingestion of particle-laden coffee when the supply of hot water to the jet ports 14 terminates. As shown in FIG. 11, each jet port 14 can be shaped to define a tapered profile with a cross sectional size that reduces toward a downstream or discharge end thereof, in combination with a filter screen 15 which can be formed as by in-place plastic molding generally at an upstream or inlet end of the jet port 14 . Upon supply of hot water to the jet port, the water passes freely through the filter screen 15 and then outwardly through the jet port 14 at a substantial velocity for intermixing with the coffee grounds within the brew basket. Upon cessation of the hot water flow, any particulate grounds which may flow or be drawn into the jet port 14 are collected on the downstream side of the filter screen 15 , where they cannot clog internal flow passages of the coffee maker apparatus. Instead, such collected grounds are retained on the screen 15 where they are hydraulically delivered back into the brew basket 12 during a subsequent brew cycle. Alternative structures for capturing ingested coffee grounds and/or for preventing backflow of such coffee grounds into and/or through the jet ports 14 will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. The thus-produced fluidized bed is swirled by centrifugal action against the inboard side of the brew basket side wall 68 , a portion of which is defined by one or more mesh or mesh-like filter elements 78 . Such filter elements 78 are supported by the brew basket 12 in slightly spaced relation to the adjacent divider wall 36 to define a flow pathway for brewed coffee to pass therebetween to a drip outlet port 79 (FIG. 6) formed in the upper bowl 29 and an underlying drip outlet port 80 (FIGS. 5-6) formed in the lower shell 39 . This lafter outlet port 80 is positioned over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 , whereby the brewed coffee flows downwardly for collection within the pot 20 . As viewed in FIGS. 1-6, the brew basket cavity 32 formed in the upper housing bowl 29 may intersect and thereby interrupt a forward region of the bowl 29 , to form an arcuate recess 83 to expose a frontal portion or segment 82 of the brew basket 12 at a front side of the brewer head 28 . In this regard, this exposed frontal segment 82 of the brew basket 12 is desirably formed from a transparent or partially transparent material to permit visual observation of the swirling and spinning fluidized bed during the brewing procedure. A lower margin of the recess 83 in the upper bowl 29 is disposed above the drip outlet port 79 . The removable cap 77 may also be formed from a transparent or partially transparent material. In use, to brew a pot of coffee, a selected volume of water is poured into the water reservoir 30 , and the brew basket 12 containing a selected quantity of ground coffee is placed into the associated brew basket cavity 32 in the brewer head 28 . A portion of the water within the reservoir 30 will flow downwardly through the first check valve 45 to fill the associated pathway within the heating unit 34 . Then, upon depression of the on-off button 22 , the heating unit 34 is energized to raise the temperature of the water therein substantially to boiling, resulting in pressure-forced pumping the hot water upwardly through the inverted and elevated inverted conduit turn 56 and further through the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 within the brew basket 12 . This upwardly pumped water is replaced by continued water downflow from the reservoir 30 , for heating by the heating unit 34 , until the reservoir 30 reaches a substantially empty condition. The hot water is jetted into the interior of the brew basket 12 via the jet ports 14 , as described, to generate the swirling turbulent fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. The thus-brewed coffee is filtered through the mesh filter elements 78 for delivery into the underlying pot 20 , wherein the brewed coffee may be retained in a heated state by suitably controlling the heating unit 34 for heating the platen 18 . Alternately, the heating unit 34 may be designed to de-activate and the brewed coffee may be retained within an insulated decanter. Following this brew cycle, the brew basket 12 may be removed from the brewer head 28 for appropriate cleaning and discarding of the spent coffee grounds retained on the filter elements. Thereafter, the brew basket 12 may be refilled with coffee grounds for a subsequent brew cycle. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention thus produces brewed coffee by means of intimately thorough and consistent intermixing between the hot water and coffee grounds, to produce a coffee beverage of repeatable high quality taste and other characteristics. In addition, because the heated water passes directly into the coffee grounds, the resultant steam rising from the fluidized bed is believed to carry enhanced or intensified coffee aroma, thereby producing an enhanced of more enjoyable coffee brewing experience. A variety of further modifications and improvements in and to the coffee brewer 10 of the present invention will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art. Accordingly, no limitation on the invention is intended by way of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings, except as set forth in the appended claims.","20040231522"

No. 15/482,121, which was filed on 7 Apr. 2017, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/320,101, filed on 8 Apr. 2016. The entire disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Technical Field Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods for brewing coffee. Discussion of Art Coffee can be consumed as a hot or cold beverage. In order to produce cold coffee (e.g., coffee that is cooled below room temperature, such as to a temperature that is no greater than 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a variety of known techniques may be used. A cold brewing technique involves grinding coffee beans and placing the ground coffee beans into cold or room temperature water for a prolonged period of time. Typically, the coffee grounds are placed into the water for twelve hours or more. The coffee grounds are filtered out of the water and coffee that is either cool or at room temperature is produced. Because of the prolonged time needed for brewing the coffee using this technique, however, cold brewing may not be suitable for many applications. Additionally, because coffee beans include components such as caffeine, oils, and fatty acids that are more soluble at elevated temperatures but less soluble or insoluble at the temperatures at which the coffee is brewed using the cold brewing technique, the flavor profile of coffee produced using the cold brewing technique may not be desirable to many consumers. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then add ice to the hot coffee to cool the coffee to a lower temperature. This technique results in the coffee becoming diluted, which may not be desired by many consumers. Additionally, control over the flavor profile of the coffee can be difficult due to the inability to accurately control the amount of dilution of the coffee on a repeated basis. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then cool the coffee, such as by placing the coffee in a refrigerated container. One problem with this technique is that the time required to cool the coffee can be considerable. The longer the time period needed to cool the coffee, the more the coffee may oxidize. The oxidized coffee can provide a taste that is undesirable to many consumers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The subject matter described herein will be better understood from reading the following description of non-limiting embodiments, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein below: FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system for producing cold coffee; and FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for brewing cold coffee. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system 100 for producing cold coffee. The brewing system 100 is used to generate cold coffee within a relatively short time period without diluting the coffee or allowing the coffee to oxidize. As a result, the end product is cooled coffee produced in a short period of time and having a flavor profile that is the same as or closer to hot coffee than cold coffee brewed by other techniques. In one embodiment, the brewing system 100 can generate a large amount of cold coffee within a short time period, such as at least 35 gallons of cold coffee, at least 75 gallons of cold coffee, up to 150 gallons of cold coffee, up to 1,500 gallons of cold coffee, or another amount, within twenty minutes (or another period of time). Optionally (and as described below), the brewing system 100 may add a gas to the cold coffee, such as nitrogen, after brewing. The brewing system 100 includes a brewing tank 102 , such as a lauter tun or other container, that holds a filter body 104 . The brewing tank 102 forms an enclosure in which heated water is mixed with coffee grounds to brew hot coffee. In one embodiment, water is preheated in another tank and transferred to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, the water may be heated in the brewing tank 102 . For example, the brewing tank 102 may include one or more heating elements, or bodies that become heated and thereby heat the water in the tank 102 . The water may be heated to an elevated temperature suitable for brewing coffee. In one embodiment, the water is heated to a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit (or 93.3 degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the water may be heated to a temperature of 198 to 202 degrees Fahrenheit (or 92.2 to 94.4 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 198 and 202 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (or 90.6 to 96.1 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 190 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (or 87.8 to 98.9 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 190 and 210 degrees Fahrenheit. Optionally, another elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature) may be used. Some, but not all, of the heated water used for brewing coffee using the system 100 during the brewing of a single batch of coffee may be mixed with coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 . The amount of heated water that is equivalent to one third of the total amount of water used to brew coffee in a single batch may be added to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water may be added to the brewing tank 102 . For example, if seventy-five gallons of water are to be used in brewing coffee during a single batch, then twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water can be in the tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water can be added to the tank 102 , such as fifty gallons (or 190 liters) of water (e.g., when 150 gallons or 570 liters of water are used to brew coffee), 500 gallons (or 1900 liters) of water (e.g., when 1500 gallons or 5700 liters of water are used to brew coffee), or another amount can be added to the tank 102 . The coffee grounds may be relatively large size. For example, coffee beans may be ground such that, when the coffee grounds are passed through a ROTAP device, 69-75% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #20 and #30 sieves, 25-28% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #12 and #16 sieves, and 10-14% of the coffee grounds pass through a US Standard Size #30 sieve and into a pan or other collection device. Alternatively, the coffee grounds may be a smaller size. Coffee grounds are introduced into the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to begin brewing hot coffee. In one embodiment, sixty pounds (or twenty-seven kilograms) of ground coffee beans are mixed into twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water in the tank 102 . Alternatively, a greater or lesser amount of coffee grounds may be mixed with a greater or lesser amount of heated water. The amount of coffee grounds may be based on the amount of coffee to be brewed. For example, the amount of coffee grounds may increase with larger batches of coffee being brewed, and can decrease with smaller batches of coffee being brewed. The ratio of weight of heated water to coffee grounds used to brew the coffee may be a 10:1 ratio (e.g., seventy-five gallons of heated water and sixty pounds of ground coffee) in one embodiment. Alternatively, another ratio of heated water to may be used. For example, a ratio of at least 12:1 to no more than 8:1 may be used, a ratio of at least 11:1 to no more than 9:1 may be used, or another ratio may be used. The coffee grounds are agitated in the heated water in the tank 102 in one embodiment. This agitation may be performed manually, such as by an operator of the system 100 moving a paddle or other object in the tank 102 to agitate the coffee grounds. Alternatively, the agitation may be performed automatically or by machine implementation, such as by one or more motors moving one or more paddles within the tank 102 . Additional heated water is added to the tank 102 in one embodiment. The remaining amount of water used to brew the batch of coffee may be added. For example, if the amount of heated water that equals one third of the total amount of water to be used in brewing coffee is already in the tank 102 , then an amount of heated water that equals two thirds of the total amount of water to be used in brewing the coffee can be added to the tank 102 . Agitation of the coffee grounds in the water in the tank 102 can occur while the remaining heated water is introduced into the tank 102 . The coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a brewing time. This brewing time can vary to achieve different flavors of coffee, can vary based on the amount of coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 , and/or can vary based on the amount of heated water in the brewing tank 102 . In one embodiment, the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a time period of at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty minutes. Alternatively, a shorter or longer time period may be used. This time period may be referred to as a contact time. Once the brewing time is complete, a drain valve 106 opens. The drain valve 106 controls flow of the coffee brewed in the tank 102 (referred to as hot coffee or hot brewed coffee) through one or more conduits 108 in the system 100 . A first portion of the conduits 108 fluidly couples the brewing tank 102 with a filter 110 . Responsive to opening the drain valve 106 , the hot brewed coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 and flows through the first portion of the conduits 108 to the filter 110 . The filter 110 may be referred to as an in-line filter. The hot brewed coffee can flow through the filter body 104 , where at least some of the coffee grounds introduced into the brewing tank 102 are filtered or otherwise removed from the hot brewed coffee. The filter body 104 may be a metal filter or another type of filter. The coffee passing through the filter body 104 may include some additional coffee grounds, which are removed from the hot brewed coffee by the filter 110 . The hot brewed coffee flows through the filter 110 to remove remaining coffee grounds. The filter 110 may be a centrifugal filter or another type of filter. In one embodiment, the filter 110 is a twenty inch (or fifty-one centimeter) inline filter with a metal wedge wire micron 127 filter. Alternatively, another type of filter may be used. A pump 112 generates a suction force in the conduits 108 to draw the hot brewed coffee through the conduits 108 . The pump 112 can pull on the hot brewed coffee flowing out of the brewing tank 102 and through the filter 110 . The coffee exiting the filter 110 can be referred to as filtered coffee. The pump 112 can direct the filtered coffee (which may remain at an elevated temperature, such as the temperature at which the coffee was brewed or slightly less, such as five to ten degrees Fahrenheit less) through a second portion of the conduits 108 to a heat exchanger 114 . With the storage tank 102 and the pump 112 , a unique coffee brewing process is provided by the system 100 . This brewing process includes a first stage, immersion type of coffee brewing, where the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 (e.g., with the drain valve 106 remaining closed) for a first designated period of time. This first designated period of time may be approximately six minutes in one embodiment. Alternatively, a different period of time may be used, such as between five and seven minutes. The brewing process includes a subsequent, second stage of pressure assisted drip type of coffee brewing. This stage involves the coffee dripping out of a bed of coffee grounds formed on the filter body 104 in the storage tank 102 into the first portion of the conduits 108 . The coffee may be drawn through this bed of coffee grounds by the pressure or suction generated by the pump 112 . This second stage of the brewing process can last for a different, second designated period of time. This second designated period of time may be approximately nine to fourteen minutes. For example, the second designated period of time may be at least nine minutes and no more than fourteen minutes. Alternatively, the second designated period of time may be different, such as at least eight minutes and no more than fifteen minutes, at least seven minutes and no more than sixteen minutes, or another period of time. The heat exchanger 114 cools the filtered coffee to a designated reduced temperature. The heat exchanger 114 can be a plate-style heat exchanger that pumps water, glycol, or other fluids in channels that are separate from, but thermally coupled with, channels in the heat exchanger 114 through which the filtered coffee flows due to the pressure generated by the pump 112 . This allows the heat exchanger 114 to cool the hot and filtered coffee without diluting the coffee or changing the chemical constituents of the coffee. The heat exchanger 114 rapidly cools the filtered coffee in one embodiment. For example, the temperature of the filtered coffee may decrease by at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (or seventy-one degrees Celsius), by at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit (or sixty-six degrees Celsius), by at least 125 degrees Fahrenheit (or fifty-two degrees Celsius), by at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or thirty-eight degrees Celsius), or by another amount. In one embodiment, the filtered coffee is cooled during flow of the filtered coffee through the heat exchanger 114 to a temperature of forty degrees Fahrenheit (or four degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the filtered coffee may be cooled to another temperature, such as between thirty-eight and forty-two degrees Fahrenheit or three to six degrees Celsius, inclusive; between thirty-six and forty-four degrees Fahrenheit or two to seven degrees Celsius, inclusive; or another temperature. The filtered coffee is cooled rapidly and faster than the coffee would be cooled by storing the filtered coffee in a standard home refrigerator overnight or by pouring the coffee over ice. For example, filtered coffee may be cooled to the designated temperature in less than twenty minutes, less than fifteen minutes, less than ten minutes, or less than five minutes, depending on the heat exchanger 114 (e.g., the size of the heat exchanger 114 ). Keeping the total time for producing the cooled coffee relatively short can reduce the total contact time of the water and coffee with the coffee grounds. Allowing the water and coffee to remain in contact with the coffee grounds for longer time periods can significantly deteriorate the taste of the end result coffee, such as by producing a more bitter coffee than is achieved by shorter contact times between the coffee grounds and the water or coffee. Additionally, once the filtered coffee leaves the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may provide a sealed environment that does not expose the coffee to the ambient environment and/or oxygen until after the coffee is removed from the system 100 . This also can assist in producing a coffee having an improved flavor profile relative to coffee that is exposed to the ambient environment and/or oxygen during cooling or storage. The filtered coffee may be cooled without freezing or partially freezing the coffee, so that the cooled coffee exiting the heat exchanger 114 can continue to flow through a third portion of the conduits 108 to a storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the storage tank 116 can be referred to as a brite tank or bright tank. The cooled coffee is directed into the storage tank 116 by the pressure generated by the pump 112 . The time period between placing the coffee grounds into contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to placing or directing the cooled and filtered coffee into the storage tank 116 may be relatively short, such as twenty minutes or less, thirty minutes or less, or another amount of time. This short time period for brewing, filtering, and rapidly cooling the hot coffee may be used for large volumes of coffee, such as seventy-five gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, etc. The cold coffee may be brewed hot, filtered, and then cooled while not diluting the coffee or having the coffee stored in an environment that causes oxidation of the coffee for an extended period of time (e.g., more than twelve hours). Subsequent to the immersion brewing process in the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may reduce or prevent contact between the coffee and one or more constituents in the ambient environment (e.g., oxygen) by sealing the components of the system 100 from the external environment, as described above. This can assist in preventing the coffee from oxidizing or otherwise being chemically altered during the process described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the storage tank 116 is fluidly coupled with a gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can represent a tank of pressurized gas or a machine that generates the gas at an elevated pressure. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can store a gas that is introduced into the storage tank 116 to be mixed with the cooled coffee. For example, the gas source 118 may include nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas is held in the gas source 118 at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch (or at least 3.1 bar). A valve 120 is closed to prevent the gas in the gas source 118 from flowing into the storage tank 116 and is opened to allow the gas in the gas source 118 to flow into the storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the valve 120 is open prior to the coffee being introduced into the storage tank 116 in order to introduce the gas in the tank 116 . The storage tank 116 may be purged with the gas prior to transferring coffee into the tank 116 to achieve no less than 100 parts per billion of dissolved oxygen in the tank 116 at a pressure (or absence of pressure) of zero pounds per square inch. The gas can be introduced into the tank 116 at a pressure of at least fourteen pounds per square inch, at least 14.5 pounds per square inch, at least fifteen pounds per square inch, or another pressure. This introduction of the gas prior to entry of the coffee into the tank 116 can charge (or at least partially fill) the tank 116 with the gas and purge oxygen from the tank 116 . The gas and cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 together in order to mix the gas with the cooled coffee. For example, nitrogen may be mixed in with the cooled coffee. Once the coffee is in the tank 116 , the pressure of the gas is supplied into the storage tank 116 can be increased to an elevated pressure, such as at least forty-five pounds per square inch, in one embodiment. Alternatively, the gas can be supplied into the storage tank 116 at another pressure, such as at least fifty-five pounds per square inch, at least thirty pounds per square inch, and/or up to sixth pounds per square inch, or another pressure. The gas may be supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least a designated period of time. Exposure of the coffee to the gas for such as extended period of time can assist in the coffee absorbing at least some of the gas while in the tank 116 . In one embodiment, the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least twenty-four hours. Another time period alternatively may be used. In one embodiment, a carbonating or carbonation stone is placed inside the storage tank 116 while the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 . The carbonating or carbonation stone may be added to the storage tank 116 to decrease the time that the cooled coffee is held in the storage tank 116 before serving at least some of the cooled coffee to one or more consumers. For example, without the carbonating or carbonation stone, the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for twenty-four hours while the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for four hours. In the illustrated embodiment, the system 100 includes a controller 122 that operates to control various components of the system 100 . The controller 122 represents hardware circuitry that includes and/or is electrically connected with one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits, or other electronic logic-based devices). The controller 122 is communicatively coupled with various components of the system 100 to allow the controller 122 to generate and communicate control signals that direct the components to implement various actions. For example, the controller 122 can be coupled with the drain valve 106 , the pump 112 , the heat exchanger 114 , and/or the valve 120 by one or more wired and/or wireless connections over or through which the controller 122 can transmit and/or broadcast control signals to control operations of these components. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the controller 122 , or may include several controllers 122 that separately control operations of different components of the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the drain valve 106 to change a state of the drain valve 106 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the drain valve 106 (or a motor or other device coupled with the drain valve 106 ) to open the drain valve 106 or to close the drain valve 106 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the drain valve 106 is open or closed. The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the pump 112 to activate or deactivate the pump 112 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the pump 112 (or a motor or other device of the pump 112 ) to turn on the pump 112 and cause the pump 112 to begin generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 or to turn the pump 112 off and stop the pump 112 from generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the heat exchanger 114 to activate or deactivate the heat exchanger 114 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the heat exchanger (or a motor or other device of the heat exchanger 114 ) to turn on the heat exchanger 114 and cause the heat exchanger 114 to begin cooling the coffee or to turn the heat exchanger 114 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the valve 120 to change a state of the valve 120 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the valve 120 (or a motor or other device coupled with the valve 120 ) to open the valve 120 or to close the valve 120 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the valve 120 is open or closed to control the flow of gas in the gas source 118 into the storage tank 116 . FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 200 for brewing cold coffee. The method 200 can be performed by the system 100 described herein to brew cold coffee in large amounts within a short time period without diluting the coffee or changing flavor of the hot coffee that is initially brewed (e.g., through oxidation). Optionally, the method 200 can represent an algorithm that is a software program or that is used to program one or more of the components of the system 100 to brew the cold coffee. At 202 , water is heated to an elevated temperature. As one example, the water can be heated to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit, as described above. The water can be heated in the brewing tank 102 or in another location. At 204 , a portion (and less than all) of the heated water is placed into the brewing tank. For example, one third of the total water used to brew a single batch of coffee (e.g., the 75 gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, or other amount) may be adding to the brewing tank 102 . At 206 , coffee grounds are added to the heated water in the brewing tank 102 . At 208 , the remainder of the heated water is added to the brewing tank 102 . During and/or after addition of the coffee grounds and water to the brewing tank 102 , the mixture of the coffee grounds and the water may be agitated, as described above. At 210 , hot coffee is brewed in the brewing tank 102 using immersion brewing. During this brewing, the water and coffee grounds remain in the brewing tank 102 so that the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water. At 212 , a determination is made as to whether the immersion brewing of the coffee in the brewing tank 102 is complete. If the immersion brewing is complete (e.g., the coffee grounds have been in contact with the heated water for a designated time period, as described above), then flow of the method 200 can proceed toward 214 . Otherwise, flow of the method 200 can return toward 210 so that immersion brewing can continue until complete. At 214 , a drain valve is opened in order to drain the hot coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The coffee drained from the brewing tank 102 is heated. For example, the coffee may be at an elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature, above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, above 150 degrees Fahrenheit to 205 degrees Fahrenheit, or another range of acceptable brewing temperatures) as the coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 . At 216 , a pump is activated to force the heated coffee through one or more conduits. The pump may be activated to being pressure assisted drip brewing of the coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The pump may be activated at the same time that the drain valve is opened, after the drain valve is opened, or prior to opening the drain valve in different embodiments. At 218 , the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 is filtered using multiple stage filters. For example, the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 may be drained from the brewing tank 102 through the filter body 104 in the brewing tank 102 and then filtered again using the inline filter 110 . Alternatively, the hot coffee may be filtered using more than two filters or using a single filter. At 220 , the coffee is rapidly cooled. The coffee can be cooled after the coffee has been filtered, as described above. Alternatively, the coffee can be cooled prior to filtering the coffee or between filters of a multi-stage filtering process. The coffee may be cooled within a relatively short time period without diluting or chemically altering the coffee, in contrast to cooling techniques involving mixing the coffee with ice, allowing the coffee to slowly cool (thereby resulting in oxidation), etc. The coffee can be cooled by flowing the coffee through one or more heat exchangers. At 222 , the cooled and filtered coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The coffee can be stored in the storage tank 116 for at least a designated time period (e.g., twenty-four hours), or may be immediately available for consumption following completion of the brewing of the batch of coffee (where the batch is completed when the water mixed with the coffee in the brewing tank 102 has reached the storage tank 116 ). The storage tank 116 may be sealed to reduce or eliminate contact between the coffee and the external environment to reduce or eliminate oxidation or other chemical changes to the coffee. As described above, the tank 116 may be purged with the gas (e.g., nitrogen) to remove oxygen from the tank 116 , the coffee may then be introduced into the tank 116 , and the pressure of the gas can be increased to the head pressure to cause the gas to be absorbed in the coffee in the tank 116 . At 224 , the coffee optionally may be mixed with a gas. For example, nitrogen can be directed into the storage tank 116 to mix with the coffee while the coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The mixture of coffee and the gas can provide a pleasant or desired taste to at least some consumers. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes adding a first portion of a total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to a brewing tank, subsequently adding the coffee grounds to the brewing tank, and adding a remaining portion of the total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee, filtering the hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee produces a batch amount of cooled coffee, where the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least seventy-five gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 150 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 1,500 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a ratio of ten to one of the hot water to the coffee grounds by weight. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes a multiple stage brewing process that includes an immersion brewing stage of the hot coffee and a pressure assisted drip brewing stage of the hot coffee. In one example, the pressure assisted drip brewing stage occurs over a longer time period than the immersion brewing stage. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water in a brewing tank, and wherein filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes additionally passing the hot coffee through an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes agitating a mixture of the coffee grounds and the hot water. In one example, the method also includes mixing the cooled coffee with nitrogen gas. In one example, the nitrogen gas is mixed with the cooled coffee at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas for at least twenty-four hours. In one example, mixing the cooled coffee with the nitrogen gas occurs in presence of a carbonating stone. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas in the presence of the carbonating stone for no more than six hours. In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, the brewing tank is a Lauter tun. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least seventy-five gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 150 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 1,500 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the one or more filters include multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, the one or more filters include a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, the one or more filters also include an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, the system also includes a storage tank in which the cooled coffee is mixed with nitrogen gas. In one example, the storage tank includes a carbonating stone. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to improvements in devices and systems for brewing coffee or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved coffee brewer utilizing streams of heated water for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds, to yield brewed coffee having improved flavor and enhanced aroma and other characteristics. Drip-style coffee brewers are available in a wide range of different configurations and sizes for use in residential or commercial environments to produce brewed coffee. Such coffee brewers commonly include a water reservoir from which a controlled volume of water is heated and then dispensed downwardly by dripping or spraying onto coffee grounds contained within an underlying, upwardly open brew basket. The hot water intermixes with the coffee grounds to produce the desired brewed coffee beverage which is drained from the brew basket through a filter element into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In one common form, the brewer includes a refillable water reservoir from which the water is delivered through a heating element for drip-flow dispensing into the brew basket. Alternately, the brewer may be coupled directly to a tap water supply or the like. While drip-style coffee brewers of the above described type have been used extensively for many years, the flavor and other characteristics of the brewed coffee is inconsistent and, in many cases, can be of marginal or unacceptable quality. Such problems are believed to stem from inadequate and/or inconsistent intermixing of the hot water with the coffee grounds contained in the brew basket, resulting in brewed coffee exhibiting inconsistent flavor and body traits, often including unacceptable bitter taste attributes. In this regard, the downward dispensing of hot water onto the initially dry coffee grounds in the underlying brew basket can produce erosion-type channels through the coffee grounds, wherein such channels can permit a significant portion of the water volume to pass through the coffee grounds and drip from the brew basket without significantly wetting or otherwise adequately intermixing therewith. While this channeling problem can sometimes be mitigated by carefully pre-distributing the coffee grounds substantially uniformly within the brew basket, significant attention to this aspect of the coffee brewing process is seldom given. A variety of modified coffee brewers and related brewing processes have been provided in an attempt to overcome these problems and disadvantages by providing improved intermixing between the heated water and the coffee grounds within a filtered brew basket. In general, such concepts utilize mechanical stirring devices for improving thorough contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds. While such concepts may provide brewed coffee with enhanced and/or more consistent flavor characteristics, they inherently incorporate moving parts that increase the overall complexity and cost of the coffee brewer, and are susceptible to occasional break-down to require periodic repair or replacement. There exists, therefore, a continuing need for further improvements in and to coffee brewers and related coffee brewing processes for achieving significantly improved intermixing between heated water and coffee grounds, for providing brewed coffee of consistent high quality and improved flavor and other desirable attributes, without requiring mechanical stirring devices and their attendant disadvantages. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, an improved coffee brewer and brewing method are provided for producing brewed coffee with improved flavor. The coffee brewer includes a removably mounted brew basket having jet ports connected to a source of heated water and positioned to deliver hot water streams into the brew basket at a location for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds contained therein to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds for improved flavor extraction. This fluidized bed is directed against one or more mesh filter elements forming a wall portion of the brew basket for outward passage of the thus-produced coffee which is then directed into an underlying carafe or the like. In one preferred form, the coffee brewer includes a water reservoir coupled via a first check valve for flow in heat transfer relation with a heating unit. The heating unit elevates the temperature of the water substantially to the boiling point, whereupon the heated water flows through a second check valve to the brew basket. The heated water flows to and through the jet ports into the interior of the brew basket, with at least some of the jet ports being disposed at a position beneath the level of coffee grounds contained therein. As a result, the heated water is jetted or sprayed into and thoroughly wets the coffee grounds with an agitating and stirring action that is effective to lift, suspend, and turbulently stir the grounds in a manner to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne grounds. In the preferred form, the jet ports are oriented for rotationally stirring the coffee grounds with a substantial spinning or orbital path of motion. The fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds provides improved and consistent intermixing of the heated water with the coffee grounds for enhanced flavor extraction with minimal bitter and/or other undesirable attributes. This spinning fluidized bed is directed by centrifugal action in a generally radially outward direction against an inboard side wall of the brew basket, a portion of which is defined by the mesh filter element or elements which permit outward flow-through passage of the brewed liquid coffee while substantially preventing outward passage of the coffee grounds. The brewed coffee passed through the filter element or elements is directed further as by gravity flow into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention, a frontal portion of the brew basket side wall comprises a substantially transparent window visible from the exterior of the coffee brewer, when the brew basket mounted is thereon. During a brewing cycle, the spinning fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket is thus externally observable. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As shown in the exemplary drawings, an improved coffee brewer referred to generally in FIGS. 1-6 by the reference numeral 10 is provided for rapid and consistent high quality brewing of coffee. The coffee brewer 10 includes a brew basket 12 (FIGS. 4-10) for receiving a selected quantity of ground coffee (not shown). In accordance with a primary aspect of the invention, the brew basket 12 is adapted for connection to a source of heated water, and includes at least one and preferably a plurality of jet ports 14 (FIGS. 7 and 9 - 11 ) positioned for agitating and turbulently stirring the coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of suspended and water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket 12 . This fluidized bed results in substantially improved and intimately thorough wetting contact and intermixing between the hot water and the coffee grounds, for achieving enhanced flavor extraction to consistently produce a high quality, fuller-bodied and more robust coffee beverage. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention is shown generally in one preferred form in FIGS. 1-6. As depicted, the coffee brewer 10 comprises a relatively compact base 16 having a platen 18 formed or carried thereon with a size and shape suitable for secure rested support of a coffee pot 20 such as a carafe or decanter or the like. An on-off button 22 is exposed at a front side of the base 16 and may be depressed manually when brewing of a pot of coffee is desired, as will be described in more detail. A power cord 24 (FIG. 1) protrudes rearwardly from the base 16 for connecting the brewer 10 to a suitable electrical power source. A support post 26 extends upwardly from a rear side of the base 16 to support an upper brewer head 28 in a positioned generally cantilevered over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 supported on the base platen 18 . In general terms, the brewer head 28 comprises a relatively compact housing structure defining a water reservoir 30 (FIGS. 3-4) for receiving a selected volume of water for use in brewing a pot of coffee, in combination with an upwardly open cavity 32 (FIGS. 4-6) for removably supporting the brew basket 12 . Upon depression of the on-off button 22 , water within the reservoir 30 is delivered in heat exchange relation with a heating unit 34 shown mounted within the base 16 as viewed in FIG. 6, and further to the brewer basket jet ports 14 for delivery into the interior of the brew basket 12 in the form of a plurality of pressurized or jetted hot water streams. These hot water jets turbulently stir and intermix with coffee grounds contained within the brew basket 12 to produce the fluidized bed or suspension of coffee grounds within a spinning and swirling body of water within the brew basket, to produce the improved, high quality, and consistent coffee beverage in accordance with the invention. This coffee beverage is filtered and delivered from the brew basket to the underlying coffee pot or carafe 20 , ready for immediate use and enjoyment. More particularly, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 3-6, the illustrative brewer head 28 includes an upper housing bowl 29 with an internal, generally vertically oriented divider wall 36 subdividing the brewer head 28 into the upwardly open water reservoir 30 occupying a rearward region of the head 28 , and the brewer basket cavity 32 at a forward region of the head 28 . A rear hinged lid 38 is provided on the brewer head 28 for normally closing the water reservoir 30 , but this lid 38 is adapted for quick and easy pivoting movement to an open position (as viewed in FIGS. 3-4) to permit a selected volume of water to be poured into the reservoir 30 . In a typical residential coffee maker, the reservoir 30 may be sized for receiving a standardized volume of water, such as a water volume sufficient to brew a standardized volume of coffee, such as 8, 10 or 12 cups. Alternately, the brewer head 28 may include volumetric gradation marks (not shown) indicating the volume of water contained therein, to facilitate brewing of different selected volumes of coffee. As a further alternative, persons skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the coffee brewer 10 may be connected directly to a tap water source or the like, in lieu of the reservoir 30 for pour-in reception of a selected water volume. The upper housing bowl 29 defining the water reservoir 30 is mounted on a lower housing shell 39 (shown best in FIGS. 5-6) which is supported at an upper end of the support post 26 in cantilevered relation spaced above the base 16 . Water within the reservoir 30 is coupled through a port 40 formed in a bottom wall of the upper bowl 29 (FIG. 6) to an underlying receiver 44 which is mounted on the lower shell 39 within a compartment 46 defined cooperatively between the upper bowl 29 and lower shell 39 . This receiver 44 may include a spring-loaded valve positioned for engagement by the upper bowl 29 for movement to an open position permitting downward water flow from the reservoir 30 , when the upper bowl 29 is mounted on the lower shell 39 . Such downward water flow proceeds through the receiver 44 and further through a short supply conduit 48 (FIGS. 5-6) which couples the water downflow to a passage 50 formed in the support post 26 and further to the heating unit 34 . A first check valve 45 (FIG. 6) is mounted along this passage 50 within the support post 26 to permit water downflow, but to prevent upward backflow from the heating unit 34 toward the reservoir 30 . The heating unit 34 , although depicted generally in FIG. 6 by dotted lines, comprises a standard dual pathway device of the type known in the art for use in coffee brewers. In particular, the heating unit 34 incorporates an electrical resistance heating element mounted within one annular pathway and disposed in heat transfer relation with water flow through an adjacent annular pathway. One exemplary dual pathway heating unit of this general type is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,956, which is incorporated by reference herein. With this construction, the water downflow through the post passage 50 is circulated though the water pathway of the heating unit 34 which heats the water substantially to boiling. A downstream end of the water pathway through the heating unit 34 is coupled to a second flow passage 52 (FIG. 6) for upward or return flow to the brewer head 28 . The upward return flow passage 52 through the support post 26 delivers the heated water through a short transition conduit 54 to an inverted, generally U-shaped turn 56 positioned within the water reservoir 30 and disposed at least slightly above a maximum fill level of the reservoir. This inverted and elevated conduit turn 56 prevents water within the reservoir 30 from draining past the turn 56 when the reservoir is filled with water. A downstream end of the inverted conduit turn 56 is coupled by an additional supply conduit 58 to a second check valve 60 mounted at the underside of the upper bowl 29 to permit one-way flow-through passage of water from the supply conduit 58 to brew basket 12 , but prevents backflow of water to the conduit 58 . More particularly, the second check valve 60 is positioned in aligned relation with an inflow port 62 (FIGS. 3 and 6) formed in the bottom wall of the upper housing bowl 29 , at a location generally centered within the brew basket cavity 32 . In this regard, as shown best in FIGS. 8 and 10, the brew basket 12 includes a downwardly open feed port 64 having a size and shape for seated reception on the underlying inflow port 62 , when the brew basket 12 is positioned within the brew cavity 32 . This feed port 64 communicates water inflow from the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 of the brew basket 12 . The brew basket 12 may comprise a generally bowl-shaped component constructed primarily from lightweight molded plastic or the like, to provide a generally upwardly open geometry defined by a bottom wall 66 joined to an upstanding side wall 68 of generally cylindrical configuration. The bottom wall 68 is formed to include the downwardly open feed port 64 for communicating hot water inflow upwardly into a false bottom or plenum chamber 70 (FIG. 10) which distributes the hot water flow to at least one and preferably a plurality of hollow ribs 72 formed in the side wall 68 . In the preferred configuration as shown, three of said hollow ribs 72 are formed in the side wall 68 at approximate 120° intervals, and each of these ribs 72 includes a closed upper end and has at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed along the height thereof for jetting hot water streams into the interior of the brew basket 12 . FIGS. 6-7 and 9 - 10 illustrate each hollow rib 72 with a pair of vertically spaced jet ports 14 positioned and aimed for jetting water streams generally tangentially in a common swirling direction (clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 9) into the brew basket interior. At least the lower jet ports 14 on the hollow ribs 72 are positioned at a level below a normal level or upper surface of a bed of dry coffee grounds placed into the brew basket 12 for brewing coffee, as indicated approximately by the dotted line 74 in FIG. 10. Thus, when the hot water is jetted through the jet ports 14 , at least a portion of the hot water stirs and agitates the body of coffee grounds to initiate a swirling or spinning action to create the fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. That is, upon initial supply of hot water into the brew basket 12 , water passing through the lower jets 14 stirs and agitates the initially dry coffee grounds, whereas the upper jets may be disposed above the upper surface of the coffee grounds and thereby initially spray onto and wet that upper surface. As hot water flow continues, the brew basket 12 gradually fills substantially with water, while the agitating and stirring action of the lower jets continues. As the brew basket fills with water, the water level eventually increases to a point higher than the upper jets 14 , as indicated approximately by the dotted line 76 in FIG. 10, whereby the upper and lower jets 14 cooperatively stir and agitate the combined body of coffee grounds and water to suspend and swirl the coffee grounds in the form of a water-borne fluidized dispersion. Such action exposes the entire volume of the coffee grounds to the heated water thoroughly and substantially uniformly, and for substantially for the entire period of the brew cycle, to result in a significantly improved and consistently high quality brewed coffee beverage. A removable cap 77 is normally provided to close the top of the brew basket 12 and thereby prevent undesired spilling of water or coffee grounds therefrom during the brewing procedure. In one preferred form as illustrated in FIG. 11, the jets ports 14 formed along the hollow ribs 72 of the brew basket 12 may be designed for minimizing or eliminating undesirable inflow or ingestion of particle-laden coffee when the supply of hot water to the jet ports 14 terminates. As shown in FIG. 11, each jet port 14 can be shaped to define a tapered profile with a cross sectional size that reduces toward a downstream or discharge end thereof, in combination with a filter screen 15 which can be formed as by in-place plastic molding generally at an upstream or inlet end of the jet port 14 . Upon supply of hot water to the jet port, the water passes freely through the filter screen 15 and then outwardly through the jet port 14 at a substantial velocity for intermixing with the coffee grounds within the brew basket. Upon cessation of the hot water flow, any particulate grounds which may flow or be drawn into the jet port 14 are collected on the downstream side of the filter screen 15 , where they cannot clog internal flow passages of the coffee maker apparatus. Instead, such collected grounds are retained on the screen 15 where they are hydraulically delivered back into the brew basket 12 during a subsequent brew cycle. Alternative structures for capturing ingested coffee grounds and/or for preventing backflow of such coffee grounds into and/or through the jet ports 14 will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. The thus-produced fluidized bed is swirled by centrifugal action against the inboard side of the brew basket side wall 68 , a portion of which is defined by one or more mesh or mesh-like filter elements 78 . Such filter elements 78 are supported by the brew basket 12 in slightly spaced relation to the adjacent divider wall 36 to define a flow pathway for brewed coffee to pass therebetween to a drip outlet port 79 (FIG. 6) formed in the upper bowl 29 and an underlying drip outlet port 80 (FIGS. 5-6) formed in the lower shell 39 . This latter outlet port 80 is positioned over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 , whereby the brewed coffee flows downwardly for collection within the pot 20 . As viewed in FIGS. 1-6, the brew basket cavity 32 formed in the upper housing bowl 29 may intersect and thereby interrupt a forward region of the bowl 29 , to form an arcuate recess 83 to expose a frontal portion or segment 82 of the brew basket 12 at a front side of the brewer head 28 . In this regard, this exposed frontal segment 82 of the brew basket 12 is desirably formed from a transparent or partially transparent material to permit visual observation of the swirling and spinning fluidized bed during the brewing procedure. A lower margin of the recess 83 in the upper bowl 29 is disposed above the drip outlet port 79 . The removable cap 77 may also be formed from a transparent or partially transparent material. In use, to brew a pot of coffee, a selected volume of water is poured into the water reservoir 30 , and the brew basket 12 containing a selected quantity of ground coffee is placed into the associated brew basket cavity 32 in the brewer head 28 . A portion of the water within the reservoir 30 will flow downwardly through the first check valve 45 to fill the associated pathway within the heating unit 34 . Then, upon depression of the on-off button 22 , the heating unit 34 is energized to raise the temperature of the water therein substantially to boiling, resulting in pressure-forced pumping the hot water upwardly through the inverted and elevated inverted conduit turn 56 and further through the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 within the brew basket 12 . This upwardly pumped water is replaced by continued water downflow from the reservoir 30 , for heating by the heating unit 34 , until the reservoir 30 reaches a substantially empty condition. The hot water is jetted into the interior of the brew basket 12 via the jet ports 14 , as described, to generate the swirling turbulent fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. The thus-brewed coffee is filtered through the mesh filter elements 78 for delivery into the underlying pot 20 , wherein the brewed coffee may be retained in a heated state by suitably controlling the heating unit 34 for heating the platen 18 . Alternately, the heating unit 34 may be designed to de-activate and the brewed coffee may be retained within an insulated decanter. Following this brew cycle, the brew basket 12 may be removed from the brewer head 28 for appropriate cleaning and discarding of the spent coffee grounds retained on the filter elements. Thereafter, the brew basket 12 may be refilled with coffee grounds for a subsequent brew cycle. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention thus produces brewed coffee by means of intimately thorough and consistent intermixing between the hot water and coffee grounds, to produce a coffee beverage of repeatable high quality taste and other characteristics. In addition, because the heated water passes directly into the coffee grounds, the resultant steam rising from the fluidized bed is believed to carry enhanced or intensified coffee aroma, thereby producing an enhanced of more enjoyable coffee brewing experience. A variety of further modifications and improvements in and to the coffee brewer 10 of the present invention will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art. Accordingly, no limitation on the invention is intended by way of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings, except as set forth in the appended claims.","7240611"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to improvements in devices and systems for brewing coffee or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved coffee brewer utilizing streams of heated water for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds, to yield brewed coffee having improved flavor and enhanced aroma and other characteristics. Drip-style coffee brewers are available in a wide range of different configurations and sizes for use in residential or commercial environments to produce brewed coffee. Such coffee brewers commonly include a water reservoir from which a controlled volume of water is heated and then dispensed downwardly by dripping or spraying onto coffee grounds contained within an underlying, upwardly open brew basket. The hot water intermixes with the coffee grounds to produce the desired brewed coffee beverage which is drained from the brew basket through a filter element into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In one common form, the brewer includes a refillable water reservoir from which the water is delivered through a heating element for drip-flow dispensing into the brew basket. Alternately, the brewer may be coupled directly to a tap water supply or the like. While drip-style coffee brewers of the above described type have been used extensively for many years, the flavor and other characteristics of the brewed coffee is inconsistent and, in many cases, can be of marginal or unacceptable quality. Such problems are believed to stem from inadequate and/or inconsistent intermixing of the hot water with the coffee grounds contained in the brew basket, resulting in brewed coffee exhibiting inconsistent flavor and body traits, often including unacceptable bitter taste attributes. In this regard, the downward dispensing of hot water onto the initially dry coffee grounds in the underlying brew basket can produce erosion-type channels through the coffee grounds, wherein such channels can permit a significant portion of the water volume to pass through the coffee grounds and drip from the brew basket without significantly wetting or otherwise adequately intermixing therewith. While this channeling problem can sometimes be mitigated by carefully pre-distributing the coffee grounds substantially uniformly within the brew basket, significant attention to this aspect of the coffee brewing process is seldom given. A variety of modified coffee brewers and related brewing processes have been provided in an attempt to overcome these problems and disadvantages by providing improved intermixing between the heated water and the coffee grounds within a filtered brew basket. In general, such concepts utilize mechanical stirring devices for improving thorough contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds. While such concepts may provide brewed coffee with enhanced and/or more consistent flavor characteristics, they inherently incorporate moving parts that increase the overall complexity and cost of the coffee brewer, and are susceptible to occasional break-down to require periodic repair or replacement. There exists, therefore, a continuing need for further improvements in and to coffee brewers and related coffee brewing processes for achieving significantly improved intermixing between heated water and coffee grounds, for providing brewed coffee of consistent high quality and improved flavor and other desirable attributes, without requiring mechanical stirring devices and their attendant disadvantages. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, an improved coffee brewer and brewing method are provided for producing brewed coffee with improved flavor. The coffee brewer includes a removably mounted brew basket having jet ports connected to a source of heated water and positioned to deliver hot water streams into the brew basket at a location for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds contained therein to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds for improved flavor extraction. This fluidized bed is directed against one or more mesh filter elements forming a wall portion of the brew basket for outward passage of the thus-produced coffee which is then directed into an underlying carafe or the like. In one preferred form, the coffee brewer includes a water reservoir coupled via a first check valve for flow in heat transfer relation with a heating unit. The heating unit elevates the temperature of the water substantially to the boiling point, whereupon the heated water flows through a second check valve to the brew basket. The heated water flows to and through the jet ports into the interior of the brew basket, with at least some of the jet ports being disposed at a position beneath the level of coffee grounds contained therein. As a result, the heated water is jetted or sprayed into and thoroughly wets the coffee grounds with an agitating and stirring action that is effective to lift, suspend, and turbulently stir the grounds in a manner to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne grounds. In the preferred form, the jet ports are oriented for rotationally stirring the coffee grounds with a substantial spinning or orbital path of motion. The fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds provides improved and consistent intermixing of the heated water with the coffee grounds for enhanced flavor extraction with minimal bitter and/or other undesirable attributes. This spinning fluidized bed is directed by centrifugal action in a generally radially outward direction against an inboard side wall of the brew basket, a portion of which is defined by the mesh filter element or elements which permit outward flow-through passage of the brewed liquid coffee while substantially preventing outward passage of the coffee grounds. The brewed coffee passed through the filter element or elements is directed further as by gravity flow into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention, a frontal portion of the brew basket side wall comprises a substantially transparent window visible from the exterior of the coffee brewer, when the brew basket mounted is thereon. During a brewing cycle, the spinning fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket is thus externally observable. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying drawings illustrate the invention. In such drawings: FIG. 1 is a side perspective view illustrating a coffee brewer in accordance with the present invention, with a carafe positioned beneath an overlying head of the coffee brewer for drip-flow reception of brewed coffee; FIG. 2 is a front perspective view of the coffee brewer of FIG. 1, with the carafe removed; FIG. 3 is a top perspective view of the coffee brewer, with a hinged lid on the brewer head disposed in an open position to expose an underlying reservoir for pour-in reception of a volume of water for use in brewing coffee; FIG. 4 is another top perspective view similar to FIG. 3, but depicting additional removal of a brew basket and cap therefor, to expose an upwardly open cavity on the brewer head for removably supporting the brew basket; FIG. 5 is another top perspective view similar to FIG. 4, but showing further removal of an upper housing member of the brewer head, to exposed underlying water flow conduits; FIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view of the coffee brewer; FIG. 7 is a top perspective view of the brew basket; FIG. 8 is a bottom perspective view of the brew basket; FIG. 9 is a top plan view of the brew basket; FIG. 10 is a vertical sectional view taken generally on the line 10 - 10 of FIG. 9; and FIG. 11 is an enlarged fragmented sectional view showing a jet port in accordance with one preferred form of the invention, wherein heated water is jetted through the jet port into the brew basket. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As shown in the exemplary drawings, an improved coffee brewer referred to generally in FIGS. 1-6 by the reference numeral 10 is provided for rapid and consistent high quality brewing of coffee. The coffee brewer 10 includes a brew basket 12 (FIGS. 4-10) for receiving a selected quantity of ground coffee (not shown). In accordance with a primary aspect of the invention, the brew basket 12 is adapted for connection to a source of heated water, and includes at least one and preferably a plurality of jet ports 14 (FIGS. 7 and 9 - 11 ) positioned for agitating and turbulently stirring the coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of suspended and water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket 12 . This fluidized bed results in substantially improved and intimately thorough wetting contact and intermixing between the hot water and the coffee grounds, for achieving enhanced flavor extraction to consistently produce a high quality, fuller-bodied and more robust coffee beverage. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention is shown generally in one preferred form in FIGS. 1-6. As depicted, the coffee brewer 10 comprises a relatively compact base 16 having a platen 18 formed or carried thereon with a size and shape suitable for secure rested support of a coffee pot 20 such as a carafe or decanter or the like. An on-off button 22 is exposed at a front side of the base 16 and may be depressed manually when brewing of a pot of coffee is desired, as will be described in more detail. A power cord 24 (FIG. 1) protrudes rearwardly from the base 16 for connecting the brewer 10 to a suitable electrical power source. A support post 26 extends upwardly from a rear side of the base 16 to support an upper brewer head 28 in a positioned generally cantilevered over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 supported on the base platen 18 . In general terms, the brewer head 28 comprises a relatively compact housing structure defining a water reservoir 30 (FIGS. 3-4) for receiving a selected volume of water for use in brewing a pot of coffee, in combination with an upwardly open cavity 32 (FIGS. 4-6) for removably supporting the brew basket 12 . Upon depression of the on-off button 22 , water within the reservoir 30 is delivered in heat exchange relation with a heating unit 34 shown mounted within the base 16 as viewed in FIG. 6, and further to the brewer basket jet ports 14 for delivery into the interior of the brew basket 12 in the form of a plurality of pressurized or jetted hot water streams. These hot water jets turbulently stir and intermix with coffee grounds contained within the brew basket 12 to produce the fluidized bed or suspension of coffee grounds within a spinning and swirling body of water within the brew basket, to produce the improved, high quality, and consistent coffee beverage in accordance with the invention. This coffee beverage is filtered and delivered from the brew basket to the underlying coffee pot or carafe 20 , ready for immediate use and enjoyment. More particularly, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 3-6, the illustrative brewer head 28 includes an upper housing bowl 29 with an internal, generally vertically oriented divider wall 36 subdividing the brewer head 28 into the upwardly open water reservoir 30 occupying a rearward region of the head 28 , and the brewer basket cavity 32 at a forward region of the head 28 . A rear hinged lid 38 is provided on the brewer head 28 for normally closing the water reservoir 30 , but this lid 38 is adapted for quick and easy pivoting movement to an open position (as viewed in FIGS. 3-4) to permit a selected volume of water to be poured into the reservoir 30 . In a typical residential coffee maker, the reservoir 30 may be sized for receiving a standardized volume of water, such as a water volume sufficient to brew a standardized volume of coffee, such as 8, 10 or 12 cups. Alternately, the brewer head 28 may include volumetric gradation marks (not shown) indicating the volume of water contained therein, to facilitate brewing of different selected volumes of coffee. As a further alternative, persons skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the coffee brewer 10 may be connected directly to a tap water source or the like, in lieu of the reservoir 30 for pour-in reception of a selected water volume. The upper housing bowl 29 defining the water reservoir 30 is mounted on a lower housing shell 39 (shown best in FIGS. 5-6) which is supported at an upper end of the support post 26 in cantilevered relation spaced above the base 16 . Water within the reservoir 30 is coupled through a port 40 formed in a bottom wall of the upper bowl 29 (FIG. 6) to an underlying receiver 44 which is mounted on the lower shell 39 within a compartment 46 defined cooperatively between the upper bowl 29 and lower shell 39 . This receiver 44 may include a spring-loaded valve positioned for engagement by the upper bowl 29 for movement to an open position permitting downward water flow from the reservoir 30 , when the upper bowl 29 is mounted on the lower shell 39 . Such downward water flow proceeds through the receiver 44 and further through a short supply conduit 48 (FIGS. 5-6) which couples the water downflow to a passage 50 formed in the support post 26 and further to the heating unit 34 . A first check valve 45 (FIG. 6) is mounted along this passage 50 within the support post 26 to permit water downflow, but to prevent upward backflow from the heating unit 34 toward the reservoir 30 . The heating unit 34 , although depicted generally in FIG. 6 by dotted lines, comprises a standard dual pathway device of the type known in the art for use in coffee brewers. In particular, the heating unit 34 incorporates an electrical resistance heating element mounted within one annular pathway and disposed in heat transfer relation with water flow through an adjacent annular pathway. One exemplary dual pathway heating unit of this general type is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,956, which is incorporated by reference herein. With this construction, the water downflow through the post passage 50 is circulated though the water pathway of the heating unit 34 which heats the water substantially to boiling. A downstream end of the water pathway through the heating unit 34 is coupled to a second flow passage 52 (FIG. 6) for upward or return flow to the brewer head 28 . The upward return flow passage 52 through the support post 26 delivers the heated water through a short transition conduit 54 to an inverted, generally U-shaped turn 56 positioned within the water reservoir 30 and disposed at least slightly above a maximum fill level of the reservoir. This inverted and elevated conduit turn 56 prevents water within the reservoir 30 from draining past the turn 56 when the reservoir is filled with water. A downstream end of the inverted conduit turn 56 is coupled by an additional supply conduit 58 to a second check valve 60 mounted at the underside of the upper bowl 29 to permit one-way flow-through passage of water from the supply conduit 58 to brew basket 12 , but prevents backflow of water to the conduit 58 . More particularly, the second check valve 60 is positioned in aligned relation with an inflow port 62 (FIGS. 3 and 6) formed in the bottom wall of the upper housing bowl 29 , at a location generally centered within the brew basket cavity 32 . In this regard, as shown best in FIGS. 8 and 10, the brew basket 12 includes a downwardly open feed port 64 having a size and shape for seated reception on the underlying inflow port 62 , when the brew basket 12 is positioned within the brew cavity 32 . This feed port 64 communicates water inflow from the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 of the brew basket 12 . The brew basket 12 may comprise a generally bowl-shaped component constructed primarily from lightweight molded plastic or the like, to provide a generally upwardly open geometry defined by a bottom wall 66 joined to an upstanding side wall 68 of generally cylindrical configuration. The bottom wall 68 is formed to include the downwardly open feed port 64 for communicating hot water inflow upwardly into a false bottom or plenum chamber 70 (FIG. 10) which distributes the hot water flow to at least one and preferably a plurality of hollow ribs 72 formed in the side wall 68 . In the preferred configuration as shown, three of said hollow ribs 72 are formed in the side wall 68 at approximate 120° intervals, and each of these ribs 72 includes a closed upper end and has at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed along the height thereof for jetting hot water streams into the interior of the brew basket 12 . FIGS. 6-7 and 9 - 10 illustrate each hollow rib 72 with a pair of vertically spaced jet ports 14 positioned and aimed for jetting water streams generally tangentially in a common swirling direction (clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 9) into the brew basket interior. At least the lower jet ports 14 on the hollow ribs 72 are positioned at a level below a normal level or upper surface of a bed of dry coffee grounds placed into the brew basket 12 for brewing coffee, as indicated approximately by the dotted line 74 in FIG. 10. Thus, when the hot water is jetted through the jet ports 14 , at least a portion of the hot water stirs and agitates the body of coffee grounds to initiate a swirling or spinning action to create the fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. That is, upon initial supply of hot water into the brew basket 12 , water passing through the lower jets 14 stirs and agitates the initially dry coffee grounds, whereas the upper jets may be disposed above the upper surface of the coffee grounds and thereby initially spray onto and wet that upper surface. As hot water flow continues, the brew basket 12 gradually fills substantially with water, while the agitating and stirring action of the lower jets continues. As the brew basket fills with water, the water level eventually increases to a point higher than the upper jets 14 , as indicated approximately by the dotted line 76 in FIG. 10, whereby the upper and lower jets 14 cooperatively stir and agitate the combined body of coffee grounds and water to suspend and swirl the coffee grounds in the form of a water-borne fluidized dispersion. Such action exposes the entire volume of the coffee grounds to the heated water thoroughly and substantially uniformly, and for substantially for the entire period of the brew cycle, to result in a significantly improved and consistently high quality brewed coffee beverage. A removable cap 77 is normally provided to close the top of the brew basket 12 and thereby prevent undesired spilling of water or coffee grounds therefrom during the brewing procedure. In one preferred form as illustrated in FIG. 11, the jets ports 14 formed along the hollow ribs 72 of the brew basket 12 may be designed for minimizing or eliminating undesirable inflow or ingestion of particle-laden coffee when the supply of hot water to the jet ports 14 terminates. As shown in FIG. 11, each jet port 14 can be shaped to define a tapered profile with a cross sectional size that reduces toward a downstream or discharge end thereof, in combination with a filter screen 15 which can be formed as by in-place plastic molding generally at an upstream or inlet end of the jet port 14 . Upon supply of hot water to the jet port, the water passes freely through the filter screen 15 and then outwardly through the jet port 14 at a substantial velocity for intermixing with the coffee grounds within the brew basket. Upon cessation of the hot water flow, any particulate grounds which may flow or be drawn into the jet port 14 are collected on the downstream side of the filter screen 15 , where they cannot clog internal flow passages of the coffee maker apparatus. Instead, such collected grounds are retained on the screen 15 where they are hydraulically delivered back into the brew basket 12 during a subsequent brew cycle. Alternative structures for capturing ingested coffee grounds and/or for preventing backflow of such coffee grounds into and/or through the jet ports 14 will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. The thus-produced fluidized bed is swirled by centrifugal action against the inboard side of the brew basket side wall 68 , a portion of which is defined by one or more mesh or mesh-like filter elements 78 . Such filter elements 78 are supported by the brew basket 12 in slightly spaced relation to the adjacent divider wall 36 to define a flow pathway for brewed coffee to pass therebetween to a drip outlet port 79 (FIG. 6) formed in the upper bowl 29 and an underlying drip outlet port 80 (FIGS. 5-6) formed in the lower shell 39 . This latter outlet port 80 is positioned over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 , whereby the brewed coffee flows downwardly for collection within the pot 20 . As viewed in FIGS. 1-6, the brew basket cavity 32 formed in the upper housing bowl 29 may intersect and thereby interrupt a forward region of the bowl 29 , to form an arcuate recess 83 to expose a frontal portion or segment 82 of the brew basket 12 at a front side of the brewer head 28 . In this regard, this exposed frontal segment 82 of the brew basket 12 is desirably formed from a transparent or partially transparent material to permit visual observation of the swirling and spinning fluidized bed during the brewing procedure. A lower margin of the recess 83 in the upper bowl 29 is disposed above the drip outlet port 79 . The removable cap 77 may also be formed from a transparent or partially transparent material. In use, to brew a pot of coffee, a selected volume of water is poured into the water reservoir 30 , and the brew basket 12 containing a selected quantity of ground coffee is placed into the associated brew basket cavity 32 in the brewer head 28 . A portion of the water within the reservoir 30 will flow downwardly through the first check valve 45 to fill the associated pathway within the heating unit 34 . Then, upon depression of the on-off button 22 , the heating unit 34 is energized to raise the temperature of the water therein substantially to boiling, resulting in pressure-forced pumping the hot water upwardly through the inverted and elevated inverted conduit turn 56 and further through the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 within the brew basket 12 . This upwardly pumped water is replaced by continued water downflow from the reservoir 30 , for heating by the heating unit 34 , until the reservoir 30 reaches a substantially empty condition. The hot water is jetted into the interior of the brew basket 12 via the jet ports 14 , as described, to generate the swirling turbulent fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. The thus-brewed coffee is filtered through the mesh filter elements 78 for delivery into the underlying pot 20 , wherein the brewed coffee may be retained in a heated state by suitably controlling the heating unit 34 for heating the platen 18 . Alternately, the heating unit 34 may be designed to de-activate and the brewed coffee may be retained within an insulated decanter. Following this brew cycle, the brew basket 12 may be removed from the brewer head 28 for appropriate cleaning and discarding of the spent coffee grounds retained on the filter elements. Thereafter, the brew basket 12 may be refilled with coffee grounds for a subsequent brew cycle. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention thus produces brewed coffee by means of intimately thorough and consistent intermixing between the hot water and coffee grounds, to produce a coffee beverage of repeatable high quality taste and other characteristics. In addition, because the heated water passes directly into the coffee grounds, the resultant steam rising from the fluidized bed is believed to carry enhanced or intensified coffee aroma, thereby producing an enhanced of more enjoyable coffee brewing experience. A variety of further modifications and improvements in and to the coffee brewer 10 of the present invention will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art. Accordingly, no limitation on the invention is intended by way of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings, except as set forth in the appended claims.","RE45476"

BACKGROUND Technical Field Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods for brewing coffee. Discussion of Art Coffee can be consumed as a hot or cold beverage. In order to produce cold coffee (e.g., coffee that is cooled below room temperature, such as to a temperature that is no greater than 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a variety of known techniques may be used. A cold brewing technique involves grinding coffee beans and placing the ground coffee beans into cold or room temperature water for a prolonged period of time. Typically, the coffee grounds are placed into the water for twelve hours or more. The coffee grounds are filtered out of the water and coffee that is either cool or at room temperature is produced. Because of the prolonged time needed for brewing the coffee using this technique, however, cold brewing may not be suitable for many applications. Additionally, because coffee beans include components such as caffeine, oils, and fatty acids that are more soluble at elevated temperatures but less soluble or insoluble at the temperatures at which the coffee is brewed using the cold brewing technique, the flavor profile of coffee produced using the cold brewing technique may not be desirable to many consumers. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then add ice to the hot coffee to cool the coffee to a lower temperature. This technique results in the coffee becoming diluted, which may not be desired by many consumers. Additionally, control over the flavor profile of the coffee can be difficult due to the inability to accurately control the amount of dilution of the coffee on a repeated basis. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then cool the coffee, such as by placing the coffee in a refrigerated container. One problem with this technique is that the time required to cool the coffee can be considerable. The longer the time period needed to cool the coffee, the more the coffee may oxidize. The oxidized coffee can provide a taste that is undesirable to many consumers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The subject matter described herein will be better understood from reading the following description of non-limiting embodiments, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein below: FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system for producing cold coffee; and FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for brewing cold coffee. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system 100 for producing cold coffee. The brewing system 100 is used to generate cold coffee within a relatively short time period without diluting the coffee or allowing the coffee to oxidize. As a result, the end product is cooled coffee produced in a short period of time and having a flavor profile that is the same as or closer to hot coffee than cold coffee brewed by other techniques. In one embodiment, the brewing system 100 can generate a large amount of cold coffee within a short time period, such as at least 35 gallons of cold coffee, at least 75 gallons of cold coffee, up to 150 gallons of cold coffee, up to 1,500 gallons of cold coffee, or another amount, within twenty minutes (or another period of time). Optionally (and as described below), the brewing system 100 may add a gas to the cold coffee, such as nitrogen, after brewing. The brewing system 100 includes a brewing tank 102 , such as a lauter tun or other container, that holds a filter body 104 . The brewing tank 102 forms an enclosure in which heated water is mixed with coffee grounds to brew hot coffee. In one embodiment, water is preheated in another tank and transferred to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, the water may be heated in the brewing tank 102 . For example, the brewing tank 102 may include one or more heating elements, or bodies that become heated and thereby heat the water in the tank 102 . The water may be heated to an elevated temperature suitable for brewing coffee. In one embodiment, the water is heated to a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit (or 93.3 degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the water may be heated to a temperature of 198 to 202 degrees Fahrenheit (or 92.2 to 94.4 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 198 and 202 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (or 90.6 to 96.1 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 190 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (or 87.8 to 98.9 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 190 and 210 degrees Fahrenheit. Optionally, another elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature) may be used. Some, but not all, of the heated water used for brewing coffee using the system 100 during the brewing of a single batch of coffee may be mixed with coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 . The amount of heated water that is equivalent to one third of the total amount of water used to brew coffee in a single batch may be added to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water may be added to the brewing tank 102 . For example, if seventy-five gallons of water are to be used in brewing coffee during a single batch, then twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water can be in the tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water can be added to the tank 102 , such as fifty gallons (or 190 liters) of water (e.g., when 150 gallons or 570 liters of water are used to brew coffee), 500 gallons (or 1900 liters) of water (e.g., when 1500 gallons or 5700 liters of water are used to brew coffee), or another amount can be added to the tank 102 . The coffee grounds may be relatively large size. For example, coffee beans may be ground such that, when the coffee grounds are passed through a ROTAP device, 69-75% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #20 and #30 sieves, 25-28% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #12 and #16 sieves, and 10-14% of the coffee grounds pass through a US Standard Size #30 sieve and into a pan or other collection device. Alternatively, the coffee grounds may be a smaller size. Coffee grounds are introduced into the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to begin brewing hot coffee. In one embodiment, sixty pounds (or twenty-seven kilograms) of ground coffee beans are mixed into twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water in the tank 102 . Alternatively, a greater or lesser amount of coffee grounds may be mixed with a greater or lesser amount of heated water. The amount of coffee grounds may be based on the amount of coffee to be brewed. For example, the amount of coffee grounds may increase with larger batches of coffee being brewed, and can decrease with smaller batches of coffee being brewed. The ratio of weight of heated water to coffee grounds used to brew the coffee may be a 10:1 ratio (e.g., seventy-five gallons of heated water and sixty pounds of ground coffee) in one embodiment. Alternatively, another ratio of heated water to may be used. For example, a ratio of at least 12:1 to no more than 8:1 may be used, a ratio of at least 11:1 to no more than 9:1 may be used, or another ratio may be used. The coffee grounds are agitated in the heated water in the tank 102 in one embodiment. This agitation may be performed manually, such as by an operator of the system 100 moving a paddle or other object in the tank 102 to agitate the coffee grounds. Alternatively, the agitation may be performed automatically or by machine implementation, such as by one or more motors moving one or more paddles within the tank 102 . Additional heated water is added to the tank 102 in one embodiment. The remaining amount of water used to brew the batch of coffee may be added. For example, if the amount of heated water that equals one third of the total amount of water to be used in brewing coffee is already in the tank 102 , then an amount of heated water that equals two thirds of the total amount of water to be used in brewing the coffee can be added to the tank 102 . Agitation of the coffee grounds in the water in the tank 102 can occur while the remaining heated water is introduced into the tank 102 . The coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a brewing time. This brewing time can vary to achieve different flavors of coffee, can vary based on the amount of coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 , and/or can vary based on the amount of heated water in the brewing tank 102 . In one embodiment, the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a time period of at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty minutes. Alternatively, a shorter or longer time period may be used. This time period may be referred to as a contact time. Once the brewing time is complete, a drain valve 106 opens. The drain valve 106 controls flow of the coffee brewed in the tank 102 (referred to as hot coffee or hot brewed coffee) through one or more conduits 108 in the system 100 . A first portion of the conduits 108 fluidly couples the brewing tank 102 with a filter 110 . Responsive to opening the drain valve 106 , the hot brewed coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 and flows through the first portion of the conduits 108 to the filter 110 . The filter 110 may be referred to as an in-line filter. The hot brewed coffee can flow through the filter body 104 , where at least some of the coffee grounds introduced into the brewing tank 102 are filtered or otherwise removed from the hot brewed coffee. The filter body 104 may be a metal filter or another type of filter. The coffee passing through the filter body 104 may include some additional coffee grounds, which are removed from the hot brewed coffee by the filter 110 . The hot brewed coffee flows through the filter 110 to remove remaining coffee grounds. The filter 110 may be a centrifugal filter or another type of filter. In one embodiment, the filter 110 is a twenty inch (or fifty-one centimeter) inline filter with a metal wedge wire micron 127 filter. Alternatively, another type of filter may be used. A pump 112 generates a suction force in the conduits 108 to draw the hot brewed coffee through the conduits 108 . The pump 112 can pull on the hot brewed coffee flowing out of the brewing tank 102 and through the filter 110 . The coffee exiting the filter 110 can be referred to as filtered coffee. The pump 112 can direct the filtered coffee (which may remain at an elevated temperature, such as the temperature at which the coffee was brewed or slightly less, such as five to ten degrees Fahrenheit less) through a second portion of the conduits 108 to a heat exchanger 114 . With the storage tank 102 and the pump 112 , a unique coffee brewing process is provided by the system 100 . This brewing process includes a first stage, immersion type of coffee brewing, where the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 (e.g., with the drain valve 106 remaining closed) for a first designated period of time. This first designated period of time may be approximately six minutes in one embodiment. Alternatively, a different period of time may be used, such as between five and seven minutes. The brewing process includes a subsequent, second stage of pressure assisted drip type of coffee brewing. This stage involves the coffee dripping out of a bed of coffee grounds formed on the filter body 104 in the storage tank 102 into the first portion of the conduits 108 . The coffee may be drawn through this bed of coffee grounds by the pressure or suction generated by the pump 112 . This second stage of the brewing process can last for a different, second designated period of time. This second designated period of time may be approximately nine to fourteen minutes. For example, the second designated period of time may be at least nine minutes and no more than fourteen minutes. Alternatively, the second designated period of time may be different, such as at least eight minutes and no more than fifteen minutes, at least seven minutes and no more than sixteen minutes, or another period of time. The heat exchanger 114 cools the filtered coffee to a designated reduced temperature. The heat exchanger 114 can be a plate-style heat exchanger that pumps water, glycol, or other fluids in channels that are separate from, but thermally coupled with, channels in the heat exchanger 114 through which the filtered coffee flows due to the pressure generated by the pump 112 . This allows the heat exchanger 114 to cool the hot and filtered coffee without diluting the coffee or changing the chemical constituents of the coffee. The heat exchanger 114 rapidly cools the filtered coffee in one embodiment. For example, the temperature of the filtered coffee may decrease by at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (or seventy-one degrees Celsius), by at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit (or sixty-six degrees Celsius), by at least 125 degrees Fahrenheit (or fifty-two degrees Celsius), by at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or thirty-eight degrees Celsius), or by another amount. In one embodiment, the filtered coffee is cooled during flow of the filtered coffee through the heat exchanger 114 to a temperature of forty degrees Fahrenheit (or four degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the filtered coffee may be cooled to another temperature, such as between thirty-eight and forty-two degrees Fahrenheit or three to six degrees Celsius, inclusive; between thirty-six and forty-four degrees Fahrenheit or two to seven degrees Celsius, inclusive; or another temperature. The filtered coffee is cooled rapidly and faster than the coffee would be cooled by storing the filtered coffee in a standard home refrigerator overnight or by pouring the coffee over ice. For example, filtered coffee may be cooled to the designated temperature in less than twenty minutes, less than fifteen minutes, less than ten minutes, or less than five minutes, depending on the heat exchanger 114 (e.g., the size of the heat exchanger 114 ). Keeping the total time for producing the cooled coffee relatively short can reduce the total contact time of the water and coffee with the coffee grounds. Allowing the water and coffee to remain in contact with the coffee grounds for longer time periods can significantly deteriorate the taste of the end result coffee, such as by producing a more bitter coffee than is achieved by shorter contact times between the coffee grounds and the water or coffee. Additionally, once the filtered coffee leaves the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may provide a sealed environment that does not expose the coffee to the ambient environment and/or oxygen until after the coffee is removed from the system 100 . This also can assist in producing a coffee having an improved flavor profile relative to coffee that is exposed to the ambient environment and/or oxygen during cooling or storage. The filtered coffee may be cooled without freezing or partially freezing the coffee, so that the cooled coffee exiting the heat exchanger 114 can continue to flow through a third portion of the conduits 108 to a storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the storage tank 116 can be referred to as a brite tank or bright tank. The cooled coffee is directed into the storage tank 116 by the pressure generated by the pump 112 . The time period between placing the coffee grounds into contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to placing or directing the cooled and filtered coffee into the storage tank 116 may be relatively short, such as twenty minutes or less, thirty minutes or less, or another amount of time. This short time period for brewing, filtering, and rapidly cooling the hot coffee may be used for large volumes of coffee, such as seventy-five gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, etc. The cold coffee may be brewed hot, filtered, and then cooled while not diluting the coffee or having the coffee stored in an environment that causes oxidation of the coffee for an extended period of time (e.g., more than twelve hours). Subsequent to the immersion brewing process in the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may reduce or prevent contact between the coffee and one or more constituents in the ambient environment (e.g., oxygen) by sealing the components of the system 100 from the external environment, as described above. This can assist in preventing the coffee from oxidizing or otherwise being chemically altered during the process described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the storage tank 116 is fluidly coupled with a gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can represent a tank of pressurized gas or a machine that generates the gas at an elevated pressure. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can store a gas that is introduced into the storage tank 116 to be mixed with the cooled coffee. For example, the gas source 118 may include nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas is held in the gas source 118 at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch (or at least 3.1 bar). A valve 120 is closed to prevent the gas in the gas source 118 from flowing into the storage tank 116 and is opened to allow the gas in the gas source 118 to flow into the storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the valve 120 is open prior to the coffee being introduced into the storage tank 116 in order to introduce the gas in the tank 116 . The storage tank 116 may be purged with the gas prior to transferring coffee into the tank 116 to achieve no less than 100 parts per billion of dissolved oxygen in the tank 116 at a pressure (or absence of pressure) of zero pounds pounds per square inch. The gas can be introduced into the tank 116 at a pressure of at least fourteen pounds per square inch, at least 14.5 pounds per square inch, at least fifteen pounds per square inch, or another pressure. This introduction of the gas prior to entry of the coffee into the tank 116 can charge (or at least partially fill) the tank 116 with the gas and purge oxygen from the tank 116 . The gas and cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 together in order to mix the gas with the cooled coffee. For example, nitrogen may be mixed in with the cooled coffee. Once the coffee is in the tank 116 , the pressure of the gas is supplied into the storage tank 116 can be increased to an elevated pressure, such as at least forty-five pounds per square inch, in one embodiment. Alternatively, the gas can be supplied into the storage tank 116 at another pressure, such as at least fifty-five pounds per square inch, at least thirty pounds per square inch, and/or up to sixth pounds per square inch, or another pressure. The gas may be supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least a designated period of time. Exposure of the coffee to the gas for such as extended period of time can assist in the coffee absorbing at least some of the gas while in the tank 116 . In one embodiment, the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least twenty-four hours. Another time period alternatively may be used. In one embodiment, a carbonating or carbonation stone is placed inside the storage tank 116 while the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 . The carbonating or carbonation stone may be added to the storage tank 116 to decrease the time that the cooled coffee is held in the storage tank 116 before serving at least some of the cooled coffee to one or more consumers. For example, without the carbonating or carbonation stone, the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for twenty-four hours while the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for four hours. In the illustrated embodiment, the system 100 includes a controller 122 that operates to control various components of the system 100 . The controller 122 represents hardware circuitry that includes and/or is electrically connected with one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits, or other electronic logic-based devices). The controller 122 is communicatively coupled with various components of the system 100 to allow the controller 122 to generate and communicate control signals that direct the components to implement various actions. For example, the controller 122 can be coupled with the drain valve 106 , the pump 112 , the heat exchanger 114 , and/or the valve 120 by one or more wired and/or wireless connections over or through which the controller 122 can transmit and/or broadcast control signals to control operations of these components. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the controller 122 , or may include several controllers 122 that separately control operations of different components of the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the drain valve 106 to change a state of the drain valve 106 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the drain valve 106 (or a motor or other device coupled with the drain valve 106 ) to open the drain valve 106 or to close the drain valve 106 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the drain valve 106 is open or closed. The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the pump 112 to activate or deactivate the pump 112 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the pump 112 (or a motor or other device of the pump 112 ) to turn on the pump 112 and cause the pump 112 to begin generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 or to turn the pump 112 off and stop the pump 112 from generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the heat exchanger 114 to activate or deactivate the heat exchanger 114 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the heat exchanger (or a motor or other device of the heat exchanger 114 ) to turn on the heat exchanger 114 and cause the heat exchanger 114 to begin cooling the coffee or to turn the heat exchanger 114 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the valve 120 to change a state of the valve 120 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the valve 120 (or a motor or other device coupled with the valve 120 ) to open the valve 120 or to close the valve 120 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the valve 120 is open or closed to control the flow of gas in the gas source 118 into the storage tank 116 . FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 200 for brewing cold coffee. The method 200 can be performed by the system 100 described herein to brew cold coffee in large amounts within a short time period without diluting the coffee or changing flavor of the hot coffee that is initially brewed (e.g., through oxidation). Optionally, the method 200 can represent an algorithm that is a software program or that is used to program one or more of the components of the system 100 to brew the cold coffee. At 202 , water is heated to an elevated temperature. As one example, the water can be heated to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit, as described above. The water can be heated in the brewing tank 102 or in another location. At 204 , a portion (and less than all) of the heated water is placed into the brewing tank. For example, one third of the total water used to brew a single batch of coffee (e.g., the 75 gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, or other amount) may be adding to the brewing tank 102 . At 206 , coffee grounds are added to the heated water in the brewing tank 102 . At 208 , the remainder of the heated water is added to the brewing tank 102 . During and/or after addition of the coffee grounds and water to the brewing tank 102 , the mixture of the coffee grounds and the water may be agitated, as described above. At 210 , hot coffee is brewed in the brewing tank 102 using immersion brewing. During this brewing, the water and coffee grounds remain in the brewing tank 102 so that the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water. At 212 , a determination is made as to whether the immersion brewing of the coffee in the brewing tank 102 is complete. If the immersion brewing is complete (e.g., the coffee grounds have been in contact with the heated water for a designated time period, as described above), then flow of the method 200 can proceed toward 214 . Otherwise, flow of the method 200 can return toward 210 so that immersion brewing can continue until complete. At 214 , a drain valve is opened in order to drain the hot coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The coffee drained from the brewing tank 102 is heated. For example, the coffee may be at an elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature, above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, above 150 degrees Fahrenheit to 205 degrees Fahrenheit, or another range of acceptable brewing temperatures) as the coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 . At 216 , a pump is activated to force the heated coffee through one or more conduits. The pump may be activated to being pressure assisted drip brewing of the coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The pump may be activated at the same time that the drain valve is opened, after the drain valve is opened, or prior to opening the drain valve in different embodiments. At 218 , the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 is filtered using multiple stage filters. For example, the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 may be drained from the brewing tank 102 through the filter body 104 in the brewing tank 102 and then filtered again using the inline filter 110 . Alternatively, the hot coffee may be filtered using more than two filters or using a single filter. At 220 , the coffee is rapidly cooled. The coffee can be cooled after the coffee has been filtered, as described above. Alternatively, the coffee can be cooled prior to filtering the coffee or between filters of a multi-stage filtering process. The coffee may be cooled within a relatively short time period without diluting or chemically altering the coffee, in contrast to cooling techniques involving mixing the coffee with ice, allowing the coffee to slowly cool (thereby resulting in oxidation), etc. The coffee can be cooled by flowing the coffee through one or more heat exchangers. At 222 , the cooled and filtered coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The coffee can be stored in the storage tank 116 for at least a designated time period (e.g., twenty-four hours), or may be immediately available for consumption following completion of the brewing of the batch of coffee (where the batch is completed when the water mixed with the coffee in the brewing tank 102 has reached the storage tank 116 ). The storage tank 116 may be sealed to reduce or eliminate contact between the coffee and the external environment to reduce or eliminate oxidation or other chemical changes to the coffee. As described above, the tank 116 may be purged with the gas (e.g., nitrogen) to remove oxygen from the tank 116 , the coffee may then be introduced into the tank 116 , and the pressure of the gas can be increased to the head pressure to cause the gas to be absorbed in the coffee in the tank 116 . At 224 , the coffee optionally may be mixed with a gas. For example, nitrogen can be directed into the storage tank 116 to mix with the coffee while the coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The mixture of coffee and the gas can provide a pleasant or desired taste to at least some consumers. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes adding a first portion of a total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to a brewing tank, subsequently adding the coffee grounds to the brewing tank, and adding a remaining portion of the total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee, filtering the hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee produces a batch amount of cooled coffee, where the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least seventy-five gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 150 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 1,500 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a ratio of ten to one of the hot water to the coffee grounds by weight. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes a multiple stage brewing process that includes an immersion brewing stage of the hot coffee and a pressure assisted drip brewing stage of the hot coffee. In one example, the pressure assisted drip brewing stage occurs over a longer time period than the immersion brewing stage. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water in a brewing tank, and wherein filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes additionally passing the hot coffee through an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes agitating a mixture of the coffee grounds and the hot water. In one example, the method also includes mixing the cooled coffee with nitrogen gas. In one example, the nitrogen gas is mixed with the cooled coffee at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas for at least twenty-four hours. In one example, mixing the cooled coffee with the nitrogen gas occurs in presence of a carbonating stone. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas in the presence of the carbonating stone for no more than six hours. In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, the brewing tank is a Lauter tun. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least seventy-five gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 150 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 1,500 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the one or more filters include multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, the one or more filters include a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, the one or more filters also include an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank.

The complete text of these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a coated coffee particle and to various items made using such coated coffee particles. Further, the coated coffee particle may be formed into a structured coffee composition suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers can find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. Single serving coffee makers such as those by Hamilton Beach, Cuisinart, Mr. Coffee and others are generally designed to make a single cup of coffee (but can make slightly larger volumes) using a single use ground, or powered, coffee composition. In some instances, the coffee compositions used in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be powered in nature, in other instances the coffee compositions utilized in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be contained in what is typically viewed as a single use coffee “cup.” In this instance, such a coffee “cup” container/structure can contain, but does not require, a built-in filter element that lines the inside surface of such a single “use” coffee cup container/structure. It should be noted that although such coffee cup containers/structures are viewed as single use, the end user or consumer can, and often does, use such single use coffee cups more than once. Other forms of coffee makers and methods for preparing coffee include, but are not limited to, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced whereby various manufacturers provide coffee in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, are provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “containers,” “cups,” and/or “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are really only designed to brew a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tabletted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. Moreover, when roast and ground (R&G) coffee is exposed to air and/or sunlight for significant amounts of time, it goes stale overtime and exhibits papery notes that are evidence thereof. Further, roast and ground coffee must also be packaged in air tight packaging (e.g., wherein the removal of most oxygen must be purged therefrom) to avoid oxidation occurring thereon causing the roast and ground coffee to become stale. In light of the above and in view of the current products available in the marketplace, it would be desirable to develop a coffee composition and one or more items made therefrom that utilize a combination of instant coffee with one or more of roast coffee and/or ground coffee to achieve a coffee composition able to withstand exposure to air and light over some time without staling while still maintaining the product's integrity in combination with providing faster disassociation when brewed, thereby advantageously providing a variety of consistent coffee products of varying strengths with the ability to also use less robust packaging therefor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided are coated coffee particles and to various items made using the coated coffee particles. In another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particles can be formed into a structured coffee compositions suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use one or more of the present embodiments. The general principles described herein can be applied to embodiments and applications other than those detailed below without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Therefore, the present embodiments are not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed or suggested herein. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety as though they are fully set forth herein. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the numerical properties set forth in the following specification and claims are approximations that can vary depending on the desired properties sought to be obtained in embodiments of the present invention. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations; the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported with relative precision. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from error found in their respective measurements. As noted above, the present invention relates to coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to various coffee compositions and to a variety of items made using such coffee compositions wherein the coffee composition is in the form of coated particulates as disclosed herein. In yet another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particulates can be formed into any three-dimensional coffee structure suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, old brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. Terminology: Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Non-Coffee Binder” means a material which improves the structural integrity of a coffee composition made in accordance with the present invention. “Non-Coffee Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc., or any one or more binders made from one or more coffee ingredients and some amount of water. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, liquid coffee concentrate, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. Ground roast coffee can also be referred to as “roast coffee, ground coffee, or even a combination of roast coffee and ground coffee”. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Coffee solids” means the coffee constituents that are extracted or extractable during the brewing of coffee. Unless indicated otherwise, the term coffee solids refers to both the dissolved coffee solids and suspended coffee solids (e.g., very small grinds or fines). “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee composition means that the coffee composition is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the composition, when the composition is in place in a brewing device so as to be contacted with water (hot, cold or any temperature therebetween) for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example, flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3 weight percent) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. Furthermore, instant coffee used in the present invention can be prepared by any convenient process, of which a variety of processes are known to those skilled in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Moreover, representative spray drying processes that can provide suitable instant coffee are disclosed in, for example, pages 382 through 513 of Sivetz & Foote, “Coffee Processing Technology,” Vol. I (Avi Publishing Co. 1963), U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,771,343, 2,750,998, and 2,469,553, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Other suitable processes for providing instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,436,227, 3,493,388, 3,615,669, 3,620,756, and 3,652,293, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. The instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention can be prepared form any single variety of coffees or a blend of different varieties, and can be decaffeinated or un-decaffeinated, and can be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic as necessary. Additionally, instant coffee has many forms: spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid. “Liquid coffee concentrate” or “liquid coffee extract” as used herein designates an aqueous extract of the roasted coffee beans wherein the solids content is substantially greater than used for direct consumption as a beverage. The coffee solids content may be from about 10 wt % to about 75 wt %. The term as used here indicates a concentrated coffee extract, irrespective of this being liquid or a solid deep frozen coffee concentrate. As is generally known coffee extracts are recovered by contacting roasted and ground coffee beans with water or an aqueous solution. On an industrial scale, the intention is to achieve high extraction efficiency leading to extraction of aroma substances, that is odorants and flavorings, from the ground coffee. The concentration method is not particularly limited and can be performed by a known method and apparatus, evaporation, membrane concentration, concentration under reduced pressure, freeze concentration, and the like. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3 grams to about 5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of espresso strength brewed coffee. In one embodiment, the present invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures can be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing can include about 70° C. to about 100° C., about 80° C. to about 99° C., about 85° C. to about 97° C., or about 90° C. to about 96° C. However, it is contemplated that brewing may take place in other brewers at high pressures of greater than 100° C. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce anywhere from about 4 to about 12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The coffee products of the present invention can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and can be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. For more information related to ADC brewers see, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Coated Coffee Particle The general inventive concepts encompass various embodiments that are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a coated coffee particle. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may include a ground roast coffee particle that is coated with a coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, and at least partially drying the granulated composition. Optionally, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure. Examples of coffee extracts for use in the solution of coffee extracts include, but are not limited to, liquid coffee concentrate and instant coffee. It has been found that by mixing a solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee and at least partially drying the granulated composition a plurality of coated ground roast coffee particles may be prepared. As used herein, the coated ground roast coffee particles may be referred to as coated coffee particles or coated particulates. Through the mixing of the solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee a portion of the ground roasted coffee is extracted. Accordingly, a matrix is formed that includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee on the ground roast coffee particles. Stated differently, the matrix is composed of compounds that originated from both the coffee exact and roast and ground coffee particles. In one or more embodiments, coffee exact may be prepared from an instant coffee, a liquid coffee concentrate, or a combination thereof. For the purpose of this specification, ground roast coffee particles that include a coating of the matrix or coffee extracts and extracts from the round roast coffee may be referred to as the coated ground roast coffee particles. The coating may also be referred to as a coffee extract and ground roast coffee extract matrix or simply the matrix. The coating at least partially covers the surface of the ground roast coffee particles and may fill in any cracks or crevices on the surface of the particle. The coating of the ground roast coffee particles may also bind the particles together to form a structured coffee composition. As indicated above, the matrix or coating of the ground roast coffee particles compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. This mixture may be experimentally shown via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR analysis shows a peak that corresponds with a wavelength of 940 nm in the coffee coating that is not present in coffee extracts such as those prepared from instant coffee. This peak is high in ground roasted coffee but is present in lower amounts in the coating. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the peak may be related to lipids present in the ground roast coffee, but it may also be a combination of lipids with other compounds that absorb in this region. Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/QTOF) analysis of the coffee coating and ground roast coffee particles, and the coffee extracts may also be used to show compositional differences. For example, coffee extracts such as instant coffee have an extremely low amount of lipids and a different compositional background compared to roast and ground coffee. The presence of high amounts of lipids and/or composition similar to roast and ground coffee but different from instant would indicate a solvent was used. Further, visual appearance of the coating through by surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy or other surface measuring techniques may be used to identify that the coating of coffee extracts was added using a solvent. Visual appearance may also suggest that a solvent was used. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of problems solved, the coated coffee particle advantageously provides a solution to one or more of the following problems: (a) fast disassociation in hot or cold water; (b) the creation of a larger surface area via capillary action creating void spaces due to solution of the instant component; (c) significantly higher percentages brew solids (BS) are achieved with less coffee weight and volume; (d) delivery of improved brew profile and rich color early in brew; (e) consistent results across a full range of brew methods (i.e., ADC, single serve, French Press, cup infuser, cold brew); (f) the structured coffee composition may be prepared with 100 percent coffee or coffee related flavorings / additives; (g) coffee flavor of instant coffee portion of the composition is enhanced by extraction of flavor notes from ground roast component; (h) cold brewing can be achieved with significantly less volumes of coffee and shorter brew times (e.g., about 2 to about 4 hours or about 2 to about 3 hours for a pitcher); and (i) the product stays fresher longer (less staling perception) when stored in low barrier packaging. Ingredients: Ground Roast Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be prepared from ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “ Arabica ( s )”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “ Robusta ( s )”). See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in its entirety. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of ground coffees produced from the coffee beans discussed above can be used to make the structured coffee composition. Further, mixtures of two or more different varieties, or types, of ground coffees described above can also be used in combination to prepare the structured coffee composition. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12 weight percent. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology, “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112 to 169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. In other embodiments, the coffee been may be “pre-dried” prior to roasting. In these or other embodiments, the coffee beans may be dried to a moisture content in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Exemplary methods of pre-drying a coffee bean are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,160,757 and 5,322,703 and which are both incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. This drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional or low moisture drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at a temperature in the range of about 70° F. to about 325° F. (21° C. to 163° C.), or from about 90° F. to about 300° F., or from about 120° F. to about 275° F., or even from about 160° F. to about 250° F. over drying times lasting about 1 minute to about 24 hours, or from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, or from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, or from about 3 hours to about 6 hours, or even from about 4 hours to about 5 hours. After drying the green coffee beans (and optionally pre-drying the coffee beans), the coffee beans to are typically processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of the present invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans can be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8° C. to about 371.1° C. (about 350° F. to about 700° F.), or about 176.8° C. to about 260° C. (about 350° F. to about 500° F.), or about 204.4° C. to about 232.2° C. (about 400° C. to about 450° F.), or about 260° C. to about 287.8° C. (about 500° C. to about 550° F.), or about 315.6° C. to about 348.9° C. (about 600° C. to about 660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and can, for example, be about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or about 12 minutes to about 18 minutes, or can be about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 6 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 4 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and can, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1 minutes to about 3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° F. to about 1200° F. (about 177 C to about 649° C.), or from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, or from about 10 seconds to about 47 seconds. As is well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer ., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee that is used to make the structured coffee composition can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, or from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, or even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as about 250 μm (microns) and as high as about 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of about 400 μm to about 2,500 μm, or from about 500 μm to about 2,400 μm, or from about 650 μm to about 2,200 μm, or from about 800 μm to about 2,000 μm, or from about 900 μm to about 1,00 μm, or from about 1,000 μm to about 1,600 μm, or from about 1,200 μm to about 1,400 μm, or even about 1,300 μm. The coffee beans can be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to about 1.5 mm, or from about 300 μm to about 1,600 μm, or even from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles can be broken down during three-dimensional shape molding, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the molded structure formed from the various coffee compositions described herein. In one or embodiments, the size of the ground roast coffee particles may be described with reference to the size range of the coffee typically employed for a particular brewing method. In one or more embodiments, the ground roast coffee particles may be a coarse grind typically used for French press or percolator coffee brew, for example (e.g., about 900 microns to about 1400 microns), a medium-coarse grind typically used for pour over brewers, flat bottom drip brewer or ADC, or Aeropress, for example, (e.g., about 800 microns to about 1200 microns), a medium grind typically used for clever dripper, café solo, or single serve brewer, for example, (e.g., about 500 microns to about 900 microns), a medium fine grind typically used for Turkish coffee, for example, (e.g., about 200 microns to about 550 microns) or a super fine grind typically used for espresso, or moka pot, for example (e.g., about 200 microns to about 450 microns), or any one or more combinations thereof based on the desired type of coffee beverage and coffee strength. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by full particle size distribution curve. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than about 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. In one or more embodiment the roast ground coffee particles may be prepared using mill flaking. Mill flaking technology or mill flaking is a unique grinding process that creates a larger surface area on each flake for hot water to easily extract more of our coffee flavor. Flaked coffee is further disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,676, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/mL to about 0.35 g/mL such as, for example, about 0.263 g/mL, about 0.288 g/mL, about 0.325 g/mL, or even about 0.35 g/mL, if desired. Alternatively, the structured coffee composition can also be made for ground roast coffees having lower or higher densities, if desired. For example, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from high density coffees having densities of greater than about 0.40 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of up to about 0.60 g/cm 3 , although even higher densities are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. Similarly, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from low density coffees having densities of less than about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 to about 0.25 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.22 g/cm 3 to about 0.23 g/cm 3 (such as about 0.19 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 , about 0.21 g/cm 3 , about 0.22 g/cm 3 , about 0.23 g/cm 3 , about 0.24 g/cm 3 or even about 0.25 g/cm 3 ). Furthermore, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from higher density coffees having densities from about 0.39 g/cm 3 to about 0.57 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.40 g/cm 3 to about 0.56 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.46 g/cm 3 to about 0.48 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.47 g/cm 3 . In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3.5 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.75 to about 4.25 weight percent. In one instance, the inventive coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.6 weight percent, or from about 2.85 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or even from about 4.5 weight percent to about 4.85 weight percent. Generally speaking, the structured coffee composition can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, in one embodiment it is desirable that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular,” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. In another instance, embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the coffee compositions of the present invention is/are decaffeinated are also within the scope of the present invention. In one or more embodiments, the amount of one or more ground roast coffees (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the structured coffee composition used are in the range of about 60 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, or from about 65 weight percent to about 87.5 weight percent, or from about 70 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, or from about 72.5 weight percent to about 82.5 weight percent, or from about 75 weight percent to about 80 weight percent even about 77.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Instant Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include instant coffee. The instant coffee may be used to form a slurry in the preparation of the structured coffee composition by adding water to an instant coffee. The slurry is then combined with roast and ground coffee. It has been found that when an instant coffee is included in the structured coffee composition, the instant coffee may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. The presence of instant coffee in coffee compositions and/or structures can be detected by a number of different methods. However, one method is described in R. M. Noyes and C. M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee product to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. See various methods of detecting presence of instant coffee also as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different instant coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the method of which the instant coffee is prepared and other factors. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of less than 7 weight percent, or less than 6.5 weight percent, or less than 6 weight percent, or of less than 5.5 weight percent, or of less than 5 weight percent, or less than 4.5 weight percent, or of less than 4 weight percent, or less than 3.5 weight percent, or of less than 3 weight percent. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of about 0.5 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.5 to about 4.25 weight percent. Suitable instant coffee for use in the structured coffee composition include, but are not limited to, spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid instant coffees. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the yield of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high yield instant coffee, a medium yield instant coffee, or a low yield instant coffee. High yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of greater than 45%. High yields instant coffees may be obtained using a primary and then a secondary extract with high water temperatures. Typically, high yield instant coffees include a high robusta content to maximize extraction yield. Medium yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of between 25% to 45%. Typically, medium yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content with a minimal robusta content. Low yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of less than 25%. Low yield instant coffees may be obtained using only a primary extraction at temperatures generally at or below 100 ° C. Typically, low yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%). In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the quality of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high quality instant coffee or a low quality instant coffee. High quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that produce a cup of brewed coffee with an aroma similar to a roast and ground coffee and have a flavor with minimal processed and Carmel notes. Typically, high quality instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%) and are produced at a low extraction yield. Low quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that have a dull or unexciting flavor that may taste stale. Typically, low quality instant coffees include a high robusta content and are produced at a high extraction yield. In some embodiments a low yield, high quality instant coffee is used. In another embodiment a high yield instant coffee is used. The structured coffee composition may employ a variety and types of instant coffee can be used, including a high yield, high quality instant coffee, a high yield, low quality instant, or a low yield, low quality instant, or one or more combinations thereof any one or more instant coffee varieties and types of instant coffee. Exemplary instant coffees can be used with the present invention to make the coffee composition, including but not limited to, those as shown below in Table 1.

In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee that may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, instant coffees may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Liquid Coffee Concentrate As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include a liquid coffee concentrate. Liquid coffee concentrates may be purchased commercially or prepared prior to inclusion in the structured coffee composition. It has been found that when a liquid coffee concentrate is included in the preparation of a structured coffee composition, the liquid coffee concentrate may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. In one or more embodiments, a liquid coffee concentrates may be prepared by concentrating the draw-off stream from a liquid extraction process. This process utilizes hot and/or cool water and and/or steam to extract soluble coffee from roast and ground coffee. The liquid stream may then be concentrated by either thermal evaporation or freeze concentration or an alternate method. The concentrated stream of liquid coffee extract can be utilized to create a slurry, or with a roast and ground coffee with or without adding additional process water. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. An exemplary liquid coffee concentrate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,113,643, which is incorporated herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, a commercially available liquid coffee concentrate may be employed in the structured coffee composition. Liquid coffee concentrate is often sold in frozen form, and may be thawed prior to being combined with roast and ground coffee. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be characterized by the percent of coffee solids in the total volume of the liquid coffee concentrate. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may have coffee solids in an amount of about 10% to about 75%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 15% to about 70%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 20% to about 65%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 25% to about 60%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 30% to about 58%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 35% to about 55%,and in other embodiments in an amount of about 40% to about 50%. The amount of liquid coffee concentrate that may be included in the structured coffee composition should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least property such as binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, and staling resistance. In one or more embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on the overall weight of the total weight of structured coffee composition. Additional Additives The coated coffee particles may include on or more additional ingredients. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the structured coffee composition (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context.). Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included and, surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee products. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290; 6,277,428; 6,090,431; 1,951,357, and EP 813816, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. While binders included in certain embodiments, in other embodiments the structured coffee composition is free of non-coffee binders. In one or more embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added during the step of mixing the one or more ground roast coffee and the solution of one or more coffee extracts. In other embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added to the structured coffee composition (e.g., after the step of drying). Flavorants, both liquid and solid (or dry), can be included in the structured coffee products in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Crème Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. The flavorants that can be used include those known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavorants. A solid sweetener such as white granulated sugar may be used in connection with the structured coffee product. Examples of a whitening agent that can be used in connection with the structured coffee products include liquid dairy components and dry dairy components. Other suitable sweeteners that can be used in connection with the structured coffee compositions are those well known in the art, including both natural and artificial sweeteners, including but not limited to also high intensity sweeteners. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,706,785; 10,182,583; and 10,278,407, which disclose flavorants, sweeteners, and whitening agents for inclusion into the structured coffee products. These patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, where the coated coffee particle is in a structured coffee composition, the structured coffee composition may be made with one or more layers of additives, for example, coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers on a side of the structured coffee composition (e.g., the top, bottom, or any side or rounded face of the structured coffee composition). In these or other embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers that bisect or are situated between two portions of the coffee composition in the structured coffee composition. In other various embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be made with one or more various elements including the coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc., wherein the structured coffee composition is a homogenous mixture of any one or more of the foregoing included therein. Method of Making a Coated Coffee Particle: As indicated above, the coated coffee particles may be prepared by mixing a solution of brewed coffee extracts with ground coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. In one or more embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts may be prepared from instant coffee. In these or other embodiments, the instant coffee may be mixed with a solvent to prepare the solution of brewed coffee extracts. Suitable solvents for used in preparing the solution of brewed coffee extracts include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, brewed extracts from coffee, tea, juice, carbonated water, nitrogen infused water, and liquid CO 2 , among others. Any suitable method of mixing the instant coffee and the solvent may be used. Generally, the instant coffee and the solvent are mixed until smooth and uniform consistency is achieved. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using an instant coffee may be a slurry. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent may be from about 4:1 to about 1:2, in other embodiments from about 3:1 to about 1:1.75, in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 1:1.5, in other embodiments from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.25, in other embodiments from about 1.15:1 to about 1:15.1, in other embodiments from about 1.1:1 to about 1:1.1, and in other embodiments from about 1.05:1 to about 1:1.05. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of brewed coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, liquid coffee concentrate may be used as or to prepare the solution of coffee extract(s). In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee extract may be used as prepared (i.e. the product of an extraction and an optional concentration). In other embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be diluted with a solvent. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extracts prepared using a liquid coffee concentrate may be a slurry. Regardless, in one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may include a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. For example, a solution of coffee extracts may be prepped by combining a solution prepared by combining instant coffee and a solvent with a liquid coffee concentrate. In other embodiments, the instant coffee may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate to prepare a solution of coffee extracts. The ranges and amount of coffee solids provided above for the liquid coffee concentrate may be used in a solution of coffee extracts that includes a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. The solution of coffee extracts may then be combined with a ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Any suitable method of mixing the solution of coffee extracts and the ground roast coffee may be used. Suitable mixing device include, but are not limited to stand mixers, spatulas, and paddle mixers. In certain embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may be sprayed on the ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Typically, prior to drying the granulated composition may be described as sticky. In one or more embodiments, the amount of solution of coffee extracts and the amount of ground roast coffee in the granulated composition may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the weight of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract(s) to the weight of the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the ratio of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts to the ground roast coffee may be from about 10:90 to about 40:60, in other embodiments from about 12.5:87.5 to about 37.5:62.5, in other embodiments from about 15:85 to about 35:65, in other embodiments from about 17.5:82.5 to about 32.5:67.5, and in other embodiments from about 20:80 to about 30:70. After the granulated composition it may be formed or otherwise shaped into a structure. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into an agglomerate with a random shape. In other embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed or molded into geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure using a press or a die. Suitable presses include a Carver Press, for example Model #3912. In these or other embodiments, a low amount of pressure or compaction should be employed in the forming of the structure so the resultant structured coffee composition is not completely compressed and includes a level of porosity. For example, a de minimis amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a pressure that slightly exceeds 0 pounds per square inch (PSI). In other embodiments, an amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a compaction of the granulated composition of between 60% and 70%. For example, a portion of the granulation composition may be molded using a target compaction travel on a carver press of 94% which is calculated by taking the amount in millimeters of the 100 percent travel of the die assembly and multiplying by 0.94 to determine the amount of travel in millimeters to achieve a 94% compaction travel target using hand compaction until the target travel is achieved thereby resulting in a compaction of 60 percent to 70 percent of the granulated coffee. After the granulated composition is formed into a structure, it may be dried to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water or other solvents may be removed by air drying, microwave drying, infrared drying, etc. After the drying step a residual amount of water, moisture, or a combination thereof may remain in the coated coffee particles. The solvent content (i.e. water, other solvents, or a combination of water and other solvents) of the of the coated coffee particles may be determined by oven drying coupled with weight analysis to provide the most universal method across solvents, allowing one to measure percent loss of the solvent or Karl Fischer Titration. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a final solvent content of less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 9.75 weight percent, less than about 9.5 weight percent, less than about 9.25 weight percent, less than about 9 weight percent, less than about 8.75 weight percent, less than about 8.5 weight percent, less than about 8.25 weight percent, less than about 8 weight percent, less than about 7.75 weight percent, less than about 7.5 weight percent, less than about 7.25 weight percent, less than about 7 weight percent, less than about 6.75 weight percent, less than about 6.5 weight percent, less than about 6.25 weight percent, less than about 6 weight percent, less than about 5.75 weight percent, less than about 5.5 weight percent, less than about 5.25 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 4.75 weight percent, less than about 4.5 weight percent, less than about 4.25 weight percent, less than about 4 weight percent, less than about 3.75 weight percent, less than about 3.5 weight percent, less than about 3.25 weight percent, less than about 3 weight percent, less than about 2.75 weight percent, less than about 2.5 weight percent, less than about 2.25 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1.75 weight percent, less than about 1.5 weight percent, less than about 1.25 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the coffee composition and/or structure present. In one or more embodiments, the water content of the structured coffee composition may be described in reference to the water content of the ingredients used to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the ground roast coffee employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. In still other embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the combination of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee (i.e. the percent of water in the combined amount of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee) employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. For example, if a structured coffee composition is prepared with a ground roast coffee and an instant coffee that both have an initial water content of 3%, the structured coffee composition may have a water content with 15% of 3% (i.e., 2.55% to 3.45%). Coating Characteristics As indicated above, the coated coffee particles include a coating that compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extract(s) and extract(s) from the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the mean thickness of the coating, which may be measured using electron microscopy and/or micro computed tomography (Micro CT).

In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may include a coating with a mean thickness of about 5 microns to about 1500 microns, in other embodiments about 10 microns to about 1450 microns, in other embodiments about 20 microns to about 1400 microns, in other embodiments about 30 microns to about 1350 microns, in other embodiments about 40 microns to about 1300 microns, in other embodiments about 50 microns to about 1250 microns, in other embodiments about 60 microns to about 1200 microns, in other embodiments about 70 microns to about 1150 microns, in other embodiments about 80 microns to about 1100 microns, in other embodiments about 90 microns to about 1050 microns, in other embodiments about 100 microns to about 1000 microns, in other embodiments about 110 microns to about 950 microns, in other embodiments about 120 microns to about 900 microns, in other embodiments about 130 microns to about 850 microns, in other embodiments about 140 microns to about 800 microns, in other embodiments about 150 microns to about 750 microns, in other embodiments about 160 microns to about 700 microns, in other embodiments about 175 microns to about 600 microns, in other embodiments about 200 microns to about 550 microns, in other embodiments about 225 microns to about 500 microns, in other embodiments about 250 microns to about 450 microns, in other embodiments about 275 microns to about 400 microns, in other embodiments about 290 microns to about 350 microns, and in other embodiments about 300 microns to about 325 microns. In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the amount of the surface of the coffee particle that is coated by the coating that includes a mixture of the brewed coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the average surface area coverage of the coffee particle is in the range of about 50 percent to 100 percent, about 52.5 percent to 97.5 percent, or from about 55 percent to about 95 percent, or from about 57.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, or from about 60 percent to about 90 percent, or from about 62.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, or from about 65 percent to about 85 percent, or from about 67.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, or from about 70 percent to about 80 percent, or from about 72.5 percent to about 77.5 percent, or even about 75 percent of the exposed surface area of the coffee particle. Composition Size and Configuration: As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be used in structured coffee composition. Although the structured coffee compositions may be made in any size and/or three-dimensional geometric shape, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produce a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, an structured coffee may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and can optionally be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to break any coffee structure made from the one or more coffee compositions into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e., break a molded product/pellet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as one-half of a standard serving, or one-third of standard serving, or one-quarter of standard serving. The end user/consumer may add or reduce the number of coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference, to achieve brewed coffee that is weaker or stronger than normal. Since, in one embodiment, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; and 9,474,290, which disclose methods of adjusting the weakness or strength of a standard brewed coffee, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. Furthermore, about one (1) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about one (1) cup of coffee; or about three (3) standard servings of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or about four (4) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or even about five (5) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of dimensions, the process and ingredients the structured coffee composition may have a cylindrical structure measuring about 29 mm to about 33 mm in diameter and about 19.5 mm to about 32 mm in thickness and about 14.0 cm3 to about 27.0 cm3 in volume, which can have variations thereabout as further described below and shown in FIG. 2, and Tables 2, 3, and 4. The diameter and thickness can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 6.5 grams, about 7.5 grams, about 8.5 grams, about 10.5 grams, or even about 12.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 13 grams, about 15 grams, about 17 grams, about 21 grams, or even about 25 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 19.5 grams, about 22.5 grams, about 25.5 grams, about 31.5 grams, or even about 37.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 26 grams, about 30 grams, about 34 grams, about 42 grams, or even about 50 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. Similarly, structured coffee compositions made with different dose sizes, e.g., a coffee product made to produce one-third of a standard serving of brewed coffee per structure or molded product, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different structure configurations for the structured coffee composition are also possible. For example, cylinder, cube, cuboid, sphere, pellet, ellipsoid, triangular pyramid, hexagonal prism, truncated triangular pyramid, truncated square pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, truncated hexagonal pyramid, cone, truncated cone, diamond, a three dimensional shape with an oval-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with heart-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with triangle-shaped face, or pillow shape are contemplated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical molded structure can, if so desired, be concave or convex. Additionally, or alternatively, the outer surface of a structure or molded product can have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be in the form of a particulate or an agglomeration of particles. See FIG. 1 for examples of structural shapes. It should also be noted that comparative examples are shown in some tables and figures herein, which can be labeled “Tablet Example”. The comparative example, “Tablet Example”, is a coffee tablet made using a multi-step compaction process as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Resistance to Staling In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles may have a resistance to staling or a reduced perception of staling. Resistance to staling may be measured through the quantification of lipid oxidation byproducts, such as hexanal, that are known to be generated during coffee staling and contribute to the perception of stale coffee particulate or products. Reduced perception of staling in roasted coffee particulate or products by the end user (consumer) once brewed, can be measured though the use of a trained sensory panel calibrated to identify stale notes, such as “papery,” in a coffee brew. Advantageously, the coated coffee particles may protect coffee flavor from one or more negative organoleptic effects, such as development of paper off-notes, of staling, especially those staling effects caused by lipid oxidation. In one embodiment, this is accomplished via the use of a coated coffee particulate or product (i.e., roasted and ground coffee or coffee structures formed from a roasted and ground coffee particulate or product that has been coated in any manner discussed herein) which may limit exposure of such a coffee particulate or product to environmental conditions that cause or result in enhanced lipid oxidation. In addition, the structured coffee compositions may minimize surface area to volume ratios for coffee particulate or products that will be exposed to oxidative forces, further minimizing lipid oxidation and staling thereof. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 4 days in a UV light box. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and assessed by expert panelists for staling. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Further experimental details are included in the example section. The staling data may be reported along with the exposed surface area (i.e., the area of the surface that is exposed to light divided by the total volume of the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.5, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 1. Stated differently, the brewed coffee is perceived as not stale. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.82, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 2. Stated differently the brewed coffee is perceived to have a very slight off note. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by aging the coffee under UV lights and testing determining the hexanal content. The coffee may be aged by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 7 days. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and the amount of hexanal may be determined. Further experimental details are included in the example section. In one or more embodiments, the amount of hexanal after a week of exposure of light in the coated coffee particles may be less than 40 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 30 ng/g, other embodiments less than 25 ng/g, and in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g. Packaging and Use: The coated coffee particles are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages and/or packaging. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be provided in a package as a plurality of coated coffee particles. In other embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be bound together as a structured coffee composition. Due to the resistance to staling of the coated coffee particles, they allow for reduction of packaging materials and lowers packaging cost. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; woven and nonwoven filter paper, a nylon mesh material, boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. Moreover, the instant coated slurry and/or liquid coffee concentrate can even be used to coat the inside of a package or packaging material for the coffee compositions and/or coffee structures thereof. The packaging for the coated coffee particles may be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the coated coffee particles are periodically used by the consumer, the unused coated coffee particles that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. If desired, in embodiments where the coated coffee particles are used in structured coffee compositions, the structured coffee compositions may be packaged in any desired number so that each packaged amount can be designed to yield any desired number of brewed coffee servings and/or strengths. For example, structured coffee compositions are in one embodiment designed to produce a single serving of coffee per coffee composition and/or structures thereof can be packaged individually to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, in groups of two to facilitate making two cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of three to facilitate making three cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle and so forth up to groups of twelve to facilitate making twelve cups of coffee in a single brew. The structured coffee compositions may be packaged with more or less of the same to produce stronger or weaker coffee for a standard brew of coffee since, in one embodiment, the coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) can be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. Furthermore, in yet other embodiments designed to produce a single serving of coffee per structured coffee composition can be packaged individually as structured coffee composition to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, or can be packaged in a group of three (3) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of about four (4) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of even about five (5) structured coffee compositions coffee to facilitate making about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. One advantage is that two or more structured coffee compositions may be, via two different coffee compositions or structures formed from each respective different structured coffee composition, combined in the same brew to produce a preferred brew in which the one or more properties resulting from the combination of different coffee compositions or structures provide a desired variation, change or combination in flavor, strength, caffeine content, or other such characteristic in the preferred brew. A wide variety of types of structured coffee compositions can be provided together in a pre-packaged kit, or in a consumer selected array, to facilitate preparation of a preferred brew specific to an individual consumer's preferences. As such, an exemplary kit may include a plurality of varied structured coffee compositions, with at least two of the varied structured coffee compositions having a different predetermined property, such as, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, level of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee, or type, of coffee bean treatment. Such a kit can be provided with instructions for combining the two or more types of coffee composition to prepare a desired brewed coffee. These instructions may include one or more “recipes” for preparing one or more special predetermined blends of coffee. The present invention may be packaged as coffee compositions (if in loose powdered form) and/or as an appropriate number of structured coffee compositions. See various methods of packaging and use of coffee compositions and products as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition Properties: In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with brewing water of a desired and/or suitable temperature (any temperature could be used, for example in the range of 1° C. to 100° C., as both hot and cold coffee brews are desirable) at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated herein. The strength/robustness of the structured coffee compositions may conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a product's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the structure in an axial direction over the height of the structure or across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure. Product hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the structure is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the structure breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the structure to break is taken as the hardness of the structure, which is sometimes referred to as the “structure crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. As shown in Table 2 below and FIGS. 3A and 3B, the structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the height or axial direction of the structure in the range of about 21.3 N (Newtons) to about 61.7 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 20 N to about 65 N, about 22.5 N to about 62.5 N, about 25 N to about 60 N, about 27.5 N to about 57.5 N, about 30 N to about 55 N, about 32.5 N to about 52.5 N, about 35 N to about 50 N, about 37.5 N to about 47.5 N, about 40 N to about 45 N or even about 42.5 N. The structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure in the range of about 11.1 N (Newtons) to about 51.6 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 10 N to about 52.5 N, about 12.5 N to about 50 N, about 15 N to about 45 N, about 17.5 N to about 42.5 N, about 20 N to about 40 N, about 20 N to about 37.5 N, about 22.5 N to about 35 N, about 25 N to about 32.5 N, or even about 30 N.

For convenience, the friability of the structured coffee compositions can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating the structure in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these structures that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The structures should not be broken to obtain the weight of the structure in grams, but adjust the number of whole structures to come as close as possible to weight of the structure in grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of structures represents the friability of these structures. As shown in Table 3 below and in FIG. 4, it has been found that the structured coffee compositions, can have a friability in the range of about 50 to 55 percent to about 100 percent (total disintegration of the coffee structure), of about 57.5 percent to about 97.5 percent, of about 60 percent to about 95 percent, of about 62.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, of about 65 percent to about 90 percent, of about 67.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, of about 70 percent to about 85 percent, of about 72.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, of about 75 percent to about 80 percent, or even about 77.5 percent.

Water activity may be determined using a water activity meter such as a Rotronic Hygrolab Water Activity Meter. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. Furthermore, generally speaking, and as shown in Table 4 (water activity data) above, structured coffee compositions having the above combination of properties of about stated values and/or within claimed ranges for hardness, friability, and density within the diameter and height measurements and the about stated target weights may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. It has been further found that the coated coffee particles achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise conventional ground roast coffee composition. That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the coated coffee particles are used in a typical ADC coffee maker or other brewing devices than when the same amount of conventional ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. Yield ratios provided by the structured coffee compositions, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the structured coffee compositions relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of conventional ground roast coffee (e.g., the ground roast coffee used to prepare the structured coffee composition) is normally greater than about 1 and in many instances greater than about 1.1, greater than about 1.2, greater than about 1.25, greater than about 1.5, greater than about 1.75, greater than about 2, greater than about 2.25, greater, than about 2.5, greater than about 2.75, and even about 3 on a weight basis. As discussed herein, various particle sizes for the roast and ground coffee may be used, which may result in various percent brew solids, density, and percent porosity in the molded product. Porosity is measured by Micro-CT (also called microtomography or micro-computed tomography). In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity (i.e., percent of total volume) in the structured coffee compositions may greater than 40%, greater than 42.5%, greater than 45% or greater than 47.5%, or greater than 50%, or greater than 52.5%, or greater than 55%, or greater than 57.5%, or greater than 60%. In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity in the structured coffee compositions may range between from about 40% to about 80%, or from about 42.5% to about 77.5%, or from about 45% to about 75%, or from about 47.5% to about 72.5%, or from about 50% to about 70%, or from about 52.5% to about 67.5%, or from about 55% to about 65%, or from about 57.5% to about 62.5%, or even about 60%. In light of the above, when a standard serving of coffee is prepared the percent brew solids achieved by the structed coffee compositions are in the range of about 0.90 weight percent to about 3.00 weight percent, or from about 0.95 weight percent to about 2.95 weight percent, about 1.00 weight percent to about 2.9 weight percent, or from about 1.05 weight percent to about 2.85 weight percent, or from about 1.10 weight percent to about 2.80 weight percent, about 1.15 weight percent to about 2.75 weight percent, or from about 1.20 weight percent to about 2.70 weight percent, about 1.25 weight percent to about 2.65 weight percent, about 1.30 weight percent to about 2.60 weight percent, about 1.35 weight percent to about 2.55 weight percent, about 1.40 weight percent to about 2.50 weight percent, about 1.45 weight percent to about 2.45 weight percent, about 1.50 weight percent to about 2.40 weight percent, about 1.55 weight percent to about 2.35 weight percent, about 1.60 weight percent to about 2.30 weight percent, about 1.65 weight percent to about 2.25 weight percent, about 1.70 weight percent to about 2.20 weight percent, about 1.75 weight percent to about 2.15 weight percent, about 1.80 weight percent to about 2.10 weight percent, about 1.85 weight percent to about 2.05 weight percent, about 1.90 weight percent to about 2.00 weight percent, or even about 1.95 weight percent, based on the weight of the coffee brewed. For measurement of the percent (%) brew solids (%BS) used herein, the refractive index (RI) is measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. Then a linear regression equation is developed and used to correlate the RI to %BS. The coated coffee particles and structured coffee compositions prepared from the coated coffee particles coated coffee particles disassociate and brews rapidly in both room temperature and cold water applications when used for cold brew coffee, which is shown in Table 5. The present invention disassociates in hot water (196.5-202° F.) in about 15 to about 21 seconds, in room temperature water (72-72.3° F.) in about 1 minute 7 seconds to about 1 minute 24 seconds, and in cold water (38.7-42.3° F.) in about 2 minutes 51 seconds to about 4 minutes 12 seconds. While the coated coffee particles may be brewed by any conventional means, the coated coffee particles, when used for quick cold brew coffee provides a bold cold brew coffee strength to remain bold when served over ice. It uses less coffee and brews in a shorter time frame than conventional cold brew formulations to provide a consistent brew.

The follow list of coffee products are used to produce the various coffee brews tested by the panelists: (a) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at standard drop weight (30.5 grams) (FOL 30.5 grams); (b) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at drop weight matching the present invention composition drop weight (34.0 grams) (FOL 34 grams); (c) Present Invention (4×8.5 gram structures)−80 percent Folgers Classic Roast and Ground+20 percent Colcafe Instant (Invention); (d) Folgers Instant Crystals (14.2 grams) (Fol Inst); and (e) Colcafe Instant (14.2 grams)−Low Yield High Quality Instant (Colcafe). All products are brewed in Mr. Coffee ADC brewers in 1420 mL H2O at a temperature of about 157° F.+/−1° F. The panels are run blind and randomized. These products are evaluated and compared over a number of different coffee flavor attributes. It is determined that the coated coffee particles produce a brewed coffee that has the most coffee “Body,” such as heaviness, mouthfeel, consistency, and/or weight as it coated the tongue of the panelists. Further, Body, is the feeling of the consistency of the liquid related to the amount of extraction of the solids or any other additives that increase the viscosity (References: heaviness on tongue, fullness of mouthfeel). As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the coated coffee particle closely tracks the attributes of a conventional roast and ground coffee (both Folgers Classic roast and ground coffees) even with a mixture of instant coffee therein with the roast and ground. Working Examples: Proof of UV Treatment as an Accelerant to Induce Staling: A validation experiment is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of UV treatment to accelerate staling. This experiment evaluates the degree of difference (DOD) of brewed coffee flavor from a sealed control. The treatments include coffee placed on a foil lined tray subjected to UV aging, coffee placed on a foil lined tray and left in the dark, coffee left enclosed in its original canister after opening, and coffee left sealed in its original canister without opening. At the beginning of the experiment, ten cans of Folgers Classic Roast coffee are procured from a local grocery store (Buehler's, Orrville, Ohio). All cans are within their use by dates at time of evaluation. All cans are subjected to oxygen measurement before opening to ensure fresh coffee. Four randomly selected cans are opened and 29.5 gram lots of roast and ground coffee from each can are placed in a thin layer on two foil lined service trays (number of tray samples=8 trays total). Four of these trays are placed under UV lights, four are placed in dark in laboratory drawers. After coffee samples are distributed, the cans from which they came are then closed with their manufacture supplied lids and placed in a dark drawer at room temperature for storage. Finally, one tray of 29.5 grams of instant coffee (Folger's) is placed under UV light as well. Coffee samples are evaluated against a sealed reference at one, four and eleven days of storage. On the final day, the instant coffee is included in the evaluation. Degree of difference is scored internally by expert cuppers on the following scale: 0.2 no difference; 0.3 very slight difference; 0.5 slight difference; 0.8 moderate difference; and 1.2 large difference. Results: It is found that coffee stored under UV light is noticeably stale after one day of aging and is moderately to very different in flavor from a sealed control by day four. By day eleven, coffee stored under UV light and in the dark on trays are both moderately to very different from sealed controls and classified as stale (See Table 6 below). These results indicate that UV light treatment does accelerate the aging process. It also highlights that the sensory qualities produced by UV staling are the same as encountered in coffee samples that stale in the dark, supporting the theory that both UV exposed and non-UV exposed samples are undergoing similar aging reactions, but at different rates. Table 6 below discloses average degree of difference (DOD) scores for coffee stored under different conditions and illustrates that UV light rapidly accelerated the aging process.

The experiment examines four product forms all using an 80:20 weight percent mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee: (a) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee dry mix; (b) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed herein using water in the form of a three-dimensional coffee structure; (c) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed above using water in the form of a loose unformed particulate; and (d) flaked roast and ground coffee with instant in a dry mix. Evaluations are carried out using two different instant coffees, a high yield regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration and a high quality Colombian instant coffee from Coleafé. The experiment is set up as a randomized block design with five blocks containing three replicates of each of the four coffee forms disclosed above. At the start of the experiment, the first block is subjected to in initial evaluation before aging (Time (T)=0 days). After the initial assessment, the remaining blocks are placed under UV lights. Additional samples are evaluated at one, four and seven days. On sampling days, a block is chosen at random for evaluation. Coffee from the selected block is brewed (34 grams coffee to 1420 grams water) on an ADC brewer and subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using a trained sensory panel (no. of evaluators=9 to 11 evaluators per tasting). Panelists assign each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Before submitting coffee samples for sensory analysis, two 5.0 mL aliquots of each brew are collected for monitoring of chemical markers for lipid oxidation, including hexanal. Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Finally, samples from each treatment in each block are saved for imaging using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Results: It is found that there is a significant reduction in both staling flavor and the chemical marker for staling (hexanal) in the formed coffee structures of item (b) above versus all other treatments for both instant types (see FIGS. 9A and 9B). There is no difference between the un-formed three-dimensional coffee structures (item (c) above) and the roast and ground/instant mix control (Item (d) above). It is further determined that the exposed surface of the three-dimensional coffee structure of item (b) above has a significantly higher level of hexanal per gram dry coffee than the core of the structure (see FIG. 10). This suggests a surface area effect for protecting the coffee from staling. It is found that a coating of instant coffee is formed on individual roast and ground coffee particles during the methods of the present invention using water as described herein. However, it is also found that the coating of the roast and ground coffee particles is uneven, leaving some areas with no instant coffee coating (see FIGS. 11A, 11B and 11C). Specifically, FIG. 9A illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above are scored significantly lower compared to all other forms of coffee (items (a), (c) and (d)) for papery notes, a measure of coffee staling, for both instant coffee types. FIG. 9B illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above have significantly lower hexanal concentrations as compared to all other treatments (items (a), (c) and (d)) starting at day three of the experiment for both instant coffees evaluated. FIG. 10 illustrates that the surface of the three-dimensional coffee structures have a significantly higher concentration of hexanal than the core of the coffee structures as evidenced by higher hexanal/deuterated hexanal ratio for the surface of the coffee structures (see item (b) above). This difference is identified in the coffee structures of item (b) using both instant coffee types. FIGS. 11A, 11B and 11C are electron micrographs of un-treated roast and ground coffee particles where FIG. 11A depicts void spaces with sharp edges resulting from the remnants of cell walls of the coffee seed; FIG. 11B depicts that some portions of the un-coated coffee particulate particles are similarly un-coated; and FIG. 11C depicts that other portions exhibit an instant coffee coating. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: To test the barrier effects of an instant coffee coating apart from the effect of product form, this experiment places roast and ground coffee into metal tins that are then subjected to accelerated aging using UV light. The tins protect the coffee from light except at the exposed surface. The tins are then assigned to one of four treatments: (i) uncovered with full exposure to UV light; (ii) covered with a metal tin lid; (iii) partially covered with instant coffee coating; and (iv) fully covered with an instant coffee coating. The tins are exposed to UV light for five days and then subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation by expert cuppers and evaluated for stale flavors. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Results: After five (5) days of aging, it is found that coffee covered with a full coating of instant coffee is not significantly different from coffee covered with a tin lid, thus showing no staling effect for both treatments. Coffee exposed to UV light, or with a partial coating, tastes stale. Matching the sensory results, the level of hexanal in the uncovered samples is significantly higher than in the control or fully coated samples, indicating that the fully coated samples are protected from staling. As shown in FIG. 12, the hexanal to deuterated hexanal ratio of samples covered with a tin lid (control) or covered with a full coating of instant coffee (covered) are significantly lower than uncovered samples, indicating that less staling had occurred. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: This experiment is designed to test if thin layers of instant coffee could prevent staling of roast and ground coffee. In this experiment, thin layers if instant coffee (covering two ranges of thickness, averaging 45 μm and 258 μm, respectively) are created on a scaffolding of nylon mesh. Layers are created by applying hydrated instant coffee (1:1 w/w with water) to the mesh with a brush. The scaffold is then allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight. The resulting layers of instant coffee are then fixed over trays of roast and ground coffee. Trays are then subjected accelerated aging using UV light. Staling is assessed through sensory evaluation and measurement of chemical staling markers. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using expert cuppers. Cuppers assigned each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. The instant coffee films are visualized and their thickness measured using ESEM (150× magnification). Thin films averaged 48 μm in thickness (minimum 23 μm), while the thicker films averaged 258 μm in thickness. A nylon mesh is used as a scaffolding to form thin layers of instant coffee. To test the effectiveness of these layers in preventing staling, the mesh scaffolds with and without instant coffee are placed over trays of roast and ground coffee during accelerated aging using UV light. Results: It is found that the instant coffee films (both thicknesses) are able to reduce staling in the roast and ground coffee as assessed though sensory evaluation and measurement of the chemical staling marker hexanal (see FIGS. 13A and 13B, respectively). This experiment demonstrates that a thin film of instant coffee is able to confer a protective effect against staling for roast and ground coffee. As illustrated in FIG. 13A, papery flavor scores for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. As illustrated in FIG. 13B, the area ratios between hexanal and deuterated hexanal for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. Creating Roast and Ground Particles with Instant Coating: This set of experiments evaluates several different methods of combining at least one roast and ground coffee with a hydrated slurry formed from water and at least one instant coffee (or equivalent) for their ability to form an instant coffee coating on the at least one type of roast and ground coffee (see Table 7 for the various particulars). Coating completeness is evaluated by electron microscopy. The method of forming the coated products of Treatments 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 is discussed in detail below. Each form represents a different means of application that is effective in producing a coating with a coverage within the scope of the present invention as discussed above. As shown in Table 7, different treatments are tested to see if a coating of instant coffee within the scope of the present invention as detailed herein could be applied to roast and ground coffee particles.

Treatment 2—Roast and Ground Coffee with Liquid Coffee Concentrate, small agglomerates: Step (1): Place liquid coffee concentrate (20.0g liquid coffee concentrate for 100 grams of mix) in a clean stand mixer bowl. Agitate the coffee concentrate at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment (about 0.5 minutes) Step (2): Once the liquid coffee concentrate has begun to coat the mixing bowl, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the liquid coffee concentrate at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts liquid coffee concentrate (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams liquid coffee concentrate). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the liquid coffee concentrate suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and liquid coffee concentrate are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #8 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen. The resulting matrix is then transferred to a drying surface (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). Step (5): The resulting matrix is allowed to dry over night or until excess moisture is removed. Treatment 4—Particulate Air Dried: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) of at least one type of instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until fully mixed (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allowed dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 6—Particulate #16 Sieve: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #16 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen in order to create small agglomerates/particles over a catch tray that can be used for drying (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). The screening process creates small agglomerates that dry easily at room temperature. Step (5): The resulting mixture is allowed to dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 8—Particulate: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 60 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 60.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 10—Microgrind: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (50.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (50.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula with gentle agitation. Allow the resulting coffee-water mixture to settle for about 30 minutes. Remove any foam from the top of the instant coffee suspension and retain the de-foamed suspension. Step (2): Combine the de-foamed instant coffee suspension with microgrind roast and ground coffee in a stand mixer bowl at a ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts dry instant coffee equivalent (80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 40.0 grams of instant coffee suspension from Step (1)). Mix microgrind roast and ground coffee and instant coffee suspension using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (3): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Results: The above experiments found that by varying one of several variables, a desired shell formed from one or more types of liquid coffee concentrate or instant coffee, with any desired coverage percentage as disclosed above, could be achieved around individual roast and ground coffee particles (see FIGS. 14A through 14E) as evidenced by comparison to uncoated regions of a un-formed coffee particulate coffee ground (see FIG. 15). Variables within the scope of the present invention include, but are not limited to, increasing the amount of water in the water/instant coffee mixture, varying the roast and ground particle size, increasing the amount of instant coffee slurry to roast and ground coffee to form the instant coffee/roast and ground mixture, and/or altering the post-mix handling process. More Anti-Staling Working Examples: Multiple experiments to test anti-staling properties of coffee extract coatings are setup and run to analyze the impact of the following: (i) surface area to volume ratio; (ii) instant coffee mass to water ratio; and (iii) use of liquid coffee extract as a coating substance. Accelerated aging using UV light box is utilized for three to four days of aging. Staling of the coffee samples is assessed by expert panelists through independent assessments. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Impact of Surface Area to Volume Ratio on Staling of Coffee: Two sample types of coffee are prepared to assess the impact of surface area to volume ratio on coffee samples which include (1) loose roast and ground coffee on a tray; and (2) three-dimensional coffee structures prepared from the any one of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein. For item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee the percent of surface area exposed to UV light is controlled with aluminum foil (Al) or sheets of instant coffee film (IF) laid over the roast and ground coffee. The coffee on an uncovered tray has one (top) surface exposed to UV (50 percent of surface area) and one (bottom) surface against the tray bottom (50 percent of surface area). For item (2) the three-dimensional coffee structure (cylindrical shaped) only the top surface of the structure is directly exposed to UV light. Decreasing the mass of the structure changes its height, but does not change its diameter. Further, decreasing the mass of the structure increases the surface area exposed to UV light for a given mass of structures (approximately 34 grams). Both coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: Item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee on a tray started to stale between 75 percent and 85 percent coverage. The instant coffee film (IF) covered coffee samples performed as well as the aluminum foil (Al) covered coffee samples. The three dimensional structures of the present invention discussed herein started to stale between tablets weights of about four gram to two gram target weights. As seen in Table 8, staling of coffee samples discussed above is not detected at a surface to area volume ratio at or below 0.82. Staling is detected at a surface area to volume ratio at or above 1.39. Exposed surface area to volume ratios for preventing staling of any of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein are at least about 0, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.05, at least about 0.07, at least about 0.10, at least about 0.12, at least about 0.15, at least about 0.17, at least about 0.20, at least about 0.22, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.27, at least about 0.30, at least about 0.32, at least about 0.35, at least about 0.37, at least about 0.40, at least about 0.43 at least about 0.45, at least about 0.48, at least about 0.50, at least about 0.53, at least about 0.55, at least about 0.57, at least about 0.60, at least about 0.62, at least about 0.65, at least about 0.67, at least about 0.70, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.75, at least about 0.77, at least about 0.80, at least about 0.82, at least about 0.84, at least about 0.86, at least about 0.88, at least about 0.90, at least about 0.92, at least about 0.94, at least about 0.96, at least about 0.98, or even at least about 1. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges.

The instant coffee dilutions of items (i) through (iii) above are tested on micro grind roast and ground coffee (particle size of about 200 microns or less) and ADC brewer grind size roast and ground coffee (average particle size of about 1000 microns). All treatments of items (i) through (iii) are applied using various methods as discussed herein of the present invention at an 80:20 mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee to make coffee compositions of the present invention as discussed herein. The coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the microgrind coffee samples with a more diluted suspension of instant coffee (1:4) to water is more effective at protecting the microgrind coffee from staling than more concentrated suspensions (1:1 or 1:2), which is likely due to increased coating with less dense extract suspension on this grind size. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of three (3) (slightly stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of one (1) (not stale) For ADC brewer grind size, the larger grind size, a more concentrated suspension of instant coffee in water is more effective at protecting the coffee from staling. The larger grind size may absorb the suspension differently than smaller particles. Grind size is critical to determine the target instant coffee dilution (weight percent) for forming the coating. It is determined that different dilutions needed at different grind sizes. For the microgrind a 1:4 dilution is targeted and for the ADC brewer grind size, a 1:1-1:2 dilution is targeted. For the ADC brewer grind size, the negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). Impact of Roast and Ground Coffee to Coffee Extract Ratio on Staling: Three ratios of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract are analyzed including: (i) 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; (ii) 70:30 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; and (iii) 60:40 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract (all at a weight to weight). Two roast and ground grind sizes of coffee are analyzed for the coating of instant coffee thereof including microgrind and ADC brewer grind size. Liquid coffee concentrate is used to coat the roast and ground coffee. All roast and ground coffee samples are in particulate form. The coated coffee samples are aged under UV light for three days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the liquid coffee concentrate coating on microgrind coffee, an increased amount of liquid coffee (60:40 ratio) in the formulation helps prevent staling versus less mass of liquid coffee (80:20 or 70:30 ratios). The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is more effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 60:40 ratio received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of three point five (3.5) (slightly stale to stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). For liquid coffee concentrate coating on ADC brewer grind size, an increased amount of liquid coffee (70:30 ratio) staled while application of liquid coffee 20 percent by weight did not. The 60:40 application is too liquid to form particulates and is untestable. The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is less effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of the five (5) (very stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of one (1) (not stale). Summary of Anti-Staling Working Examples: The total solids concentration and liquid volume impact the instant coating effectiveness of protecting the roast and ground coffee from staling. Target application of the instant coating on microgrind coffee is an instant coffee dilution of 1:4 instant coffee to water and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for microgrind coffee is a target applied at 60:40 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight). Target application for ADC brewer grind size coffee for instant coffee dilution is about a 1:1 to about a 1:2 instant coffee to water ratio and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for ADC brewer grind size coffee is target applied at 80:20 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight).

No. 15/189,621, filed Jun. 22, 2016, which is a continuation of International Patent Application No. PCT/NL2014/050903, filed on Dec. 23, 2014, which claims priority to European Patent Application No. 13199299.2, filed Dec. 23, 2013, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD The invention pertains to making soluble coffee particles, and to an instant coffee comprising soluble coffee particles. Particularly, the invention pertains to soluble coffee particles with a well-retained aroma. The invention also pertains to a method of using whole roast coffee beans. BACKGROUND Coffee is a well-known drink, generally prepared as a hot water or steam extract of roast and ground coffee beans. A widespread form of coffee, is that of instant coffee. Therein the extracted coffee is turned into soluble particles (typically by spray-drying or freeze-drying). These particles can be reconstituted into liquid coffee, generally by dissolving a recommended amount of the particles in hot water. An ongoing challenge in making soluble coffee particles, is to provide such particles that, upon dissolution in hot water, will result in a liquid coffee that resembles freshly extracted coffee as much as possible. This has been an issue for coffee producers all over the world as of the coming into existence of soluble coffee. Yet, the general consumer will be familiar with the perception, when smelling and tasting the liquid resulting from dissolving soluble coffee particles in hot water, that said liquid cannot favorably compare to freshly made coffee. The foregoing issue has been attempted to be resolved by various improvements in the process of extracting coffee, and concentrating coffee extracts, for use in making soluble coffee particles. A particularly useful process, e.g., is that disclosed in WO 2007/043873, which results in better aromas. A particular desire in providing an instant coffee resides in making soluble coffee particles that generate a smell that is comparable to that of freshly roasted coffee. In this respect a method has been proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,931 to impart coffee aroma to soluble coffee. In this method, soluble coffee granules are mixed with freshly roasted coffee. The soluble coffee granules and the freshly roasted coffee are maintained in intimate contact for some time, and thereafter separated. The freshly roasted coffee in U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,931 is preferably ground. The time during which the intimate contact takes place is typically 24 hours. The method as disclosed in the foregoing reference, however, comes with a drawback in that it provides the soluble coffee particles with only a low content of aroma, and particularly of 2-methylpyrazine. Also, in respect of the aforementioned ancient disclosure of 1931, an improvement is desired in respect of the preservation of aromas upon storage of the soluble coffee. In EP 0 144 785, a drawback of the process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,931 is recognized, in the sense that the roast and ground coffee is difficult to separate from the instant coffee to be aromatized (i.e., the soluble coffee particles). The teaching of EP 0 144 785 therefore concerns a process that transfers volatile aromas from roast and ground coffee by heating, whilst the roast and ground coffee is out of contact with the instant coffee. This, however, is less desired from a process point of view, as it requires energy for heating. Also, it requires installing equipment not normally present in coffee production, to allow evaporated aromas from the roast and ground coffee to be transferred to the soluble coffee particles. In EP 0 144 785 it is further taught to add an amount of oily substance to the instant coffee, in order to improve the retention of aroma. The addition of oil is not desired, as this could change the appearance of the liquid coffee obtained by reconstitution of the soluble coffee particles. Also from a regulatory perspective, it is not generally desired to add foreign substances to coffee particles. SUMMARY In order to better address one or more of the foregoing desires the invention, in one aspect, presents a process for the preparation of aromatized soluble coffee particles, the process comprising providing soluble coffee particles, mixing the soluble coffee particles with roast whole coffee beans, holding the mixture for at least two days, and separating the beans from the soluble coffee particles. In another aspect, the invention provides a process for the preparation of aromatized soluble coffee particles, wherein coffee aroma is comprising 2-methylpyrazine, a marker substance for the present coffee aroma according to the invention, which is believed to be a characteristic coffee aroma for fresh coffees that are appealable to the consumer. This 2-methylpyrazine is transferred to the soluble coffee particles by a method comprising providing soluble coffee particles, mixing the soluble coffee particles with roast whole coffee beans, allowing the mixture to stand for at least two days, and separating the beans from the soluble coffee particles. In yet another aspect, the invention resides in aromatized soluble coffee particles obtainable by the above-identified process. In a further aspect, the invention presents in instant coffee (also referred to as an instant coffee product) comprising the aforementioned soluble coffee particles, wherein the equilibrated headspace of the instant coffee comprises a level of 2-methylpyrazine of at least 1.5 ng per ml headspace, and wherein the amount of oil in the instant coffee is 0.8 to 4.5 wt. %. In a further aspect, the invention provides a use of roast whole coffee beans for providing soluble coffee particles with additional 2-methylpyrazine aroma, by a method comprising providing a liquid coffee extract, drying the coffee extract so as to provide soluble coffee particles, mixing the soluble coffee particles with roast whole coffee beans, allowing the mixture to stand for at least two days, and separating the beans from the soluble coffee particles. In a still further aspect, the invention presents a use of roast whole coffee beans for the purpose of improving the aroma-retention of soluble coffee particles, by a method comprising providing a liquid coffee extract, drying the coffee extract so as to provide soluble coffee particles, mixing the soluble coffee particles with roast whole coffee beans, allowing the mixture to stand for at least two days, and separating the beans from the soluble coffee particles. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIG. 1 FIG. 1 is a bar diagram showing the oil content (lining) and the 2-methylpyrazine content (filling) DETAILED DESCRIPTION In a broad sense, the invention is based on the judicious insight that the specific combination of a sufficiently long holding time and the use of whole beans, results in an unexpectedly great advancement in respect of aroma addition and retention for soluble coffee particles. Thus, it is surprising that such advancement with regard to addition and retention of aroma is confined to the instant coffee by soluble coffee particles obtained by the present simple and efficient process. The soluble coffee particles of the invention, and the instant coffee of the invention comprising said particles, are indicated as being aromatized (which is a result of the method of the invention). Similarly, they are also indicated as being aroma-retaining, as the method of the invention surprisingly results not only in a favorable addition of aroma, but also in a favorable retention of such aroma. The aroma addition and retention of the soluble coffee particles of the invention extends to instant coffee comprising these particles. The term instant coffee refers to a product comprising soluble coffee particles, from which coffee in the form of a liquid drink can be made by reconstitution with hot water. In an interesting embodiment, the instant coffee comprises a small quantity of roast and ground coffee beans (i.e., insoluble coffee particles) in addition to the soluble coffee particles. In another interesting embodiment, the instant coffee consists essentially of soluble coffee particles and roast and ground coffee. In still another interesting embodiment, the instant coffee consists of soluble coffee particles. The instant product may consist of 100% aroma-retaining soluble coffee particles according to the invention. It may also comprise a combination of soluble coffee particles according to the invention (such as soluble coffee particles treated by the aromatization method of the invention or otherwise treated so as to have the characteristics of soluble coffee particles obtainable by the method of the invention), and soluble coffee particles not according to the invention (such as untreated soluble coffee particles). For example, the instant product may comprise 90%-10% treated and 10-90% untreated soluble coffee particles, more preferably 80-50% treated and 20-50% untreated. However, most preferred is that all of the instant coffee product has been treated. In accordance with existing practice in the art, the instant coffee according to the invention may comprise roast and ground coffee beans. If present, the amount thereof will generally not exceed 5 wt %, and will preferably be lower, as discussed below. For completeness' sake it is added that, in connection with instant coffee, it will be understood that the terms “soluble” and “insoluble” refer to solubility in water. It will be understood that roast and ground coffee beans are not soluble in liquid water at atmospheric pressure, whether hot or cold. Soluble coffee particles are soluble in liquid water, whereby the dissolution rate is affected by the temperature, but not the solubility as such. Further in a broad sense, the invention refers to these soluble coffee particles with such an unexpected advancement in respect of aroma due to certain constituent characteristic, such as the presence of marker compounds and the absence of compounds which impair the aroma and/or appropriate reconstitution supporting the aroma. The holding time refers to the period during which the soluble coffee particles and the roast whole coffee beans are kept as a mixture. The mixing of the roast whole beans and the soluble coffee particles can be conducted by just putting the beans and the particles together, in an arbitrary order. Preferably, however, the mixing comprises a step wherein the beans and the particles are subjected to an act of stirring, mixing, shaking, or otherwise causing the two components to be well divided in respect of each other. The mixture can be held in any manner, but preferably in a closed container, and more preferably in an airtight container. Storage humidity is preferably below 90% RH, more preferably below 80% RH and typically about 70% RH. The holding time is at least two days, preferably at least three days, and more preferably about one week. The holding time can be as long as desired, but preferably does not exceed one month and, more preferably, does not exceed three weeks. Longer holding times will generally not result in much additional aroma imparted on the soluble coffee particles, and shorter holding times are more practical in the process as a whole, particularly if the whole roast beans are subsequently used for grinding and extraction so as to produce soluble coffee particles. The holding time preferably is three days to two weeks, more preferably four to ten days. The temperature at which the mixture is held is not particularly critical. It is preferred that the temperature is in a range running from above zero to 50° C., preferably from 4° C. to 25° C. Most preferably, room temperature (18° C. to 25° C., preferably 20° C. to 23° C.) is applied. In an interesting embodiment, soluble coffee particles of a relatively low temperature (0° C. to 10° C., preferably 4° C. to 6° C.) are combined with whole roast beans of a relatively high temperature (30° C. to 50° C., preferably 35° C. to 40° C.). The invention is based on mixing soluble coffee particles with roast coffee in the form of roast whole beans. Preferably the roast coffee consists essentially of such roast whole beans. I.e., whilst it would not be practical to exclude presence of the occasional broken bean, as one or more beans might always accidentally become broken, the invention is based on the selection of roast coffee in the form of whole beans. Residual broken beans, fragments or other associated particulate bean matter which has previously been roasted and which is not soluble, is subsumed as roast and ground coffee beans in the context of the present invention. If such roast and ground coffee beans are present in the final product, i.e. the instant coffee comprising the aromatized soluble coffee particles, an insoluble residue might remain after reconstitution which is both unpleasant for the consumer and gives an off-taste in the final brew. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that over-extraction of the insoluble residue might causes this perceived off-taste. Hence, the instant coffee according to the present invention comprises such roast and ground coffee beans in an amount not exceeding 5 wt. % Preferably this amount will not exceed 3 wt %, more preferably it will not exceed 1 wt. %, and still more preferably it will be at most 0.5 wt. %. Most preferably the amount is below the detection threshold. Hence, the absence of such roast and ground coffee beans in the present instant coffee is preferred. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that the type of aromas (essentially only volatiles) generated from whole beans, is better suited for providing soluble coffee with a sustainable aroma, than the type of aromas that is transferred, particularly with oil, from roast and ground coffee beans. Also, the process of the invention results in a more favorable ratio of aroma to oil, as evidenced with reference to 2-methylpyrazine. In this regard, the process of the present invention results in soluble coffee particles that provide instant coffee with an amount of oil of 0.8 to 4.5%, preferably 1.0 to 4.3%. It is surprising that such particles with the specified characteristics, which decisively contribute to the addition and retention of the aroma of the instant coffee, are obtained by the claimed process. The instant coffee comprising the soluble coffee particles in accordance with the invention, has another remarkable advantage. This relates to the retention of aroma during so-called open shelf-life. Obviously, in the practical use of instant coffee, a container (e.g. a glass jar) will be opened by a consumer, and then used for some time (days or weeks) until the container is empty. After the first time opening, the shelf-life of the product is further referred to as “open shelf life”. It is well known that coffee aromas will more quickly be reduced once the open shelf life has commenced. An advantage of the instant coffee according to the invention is that it shows a better retention of aroma, particularly as evidenced in respect of 2-methyl pyrazine, also during open shelf-life. The roast whole coffee beans are preferably roasted shortly before use. In general, once roasted the beans will be kept no longer than one month before being mixed with soluble coffee particles, preferably less than a week, more preferably less than a day. The whole roast coffee beans and the soluble coffee particles can be mixed in a wide range of ratio's. Preferably, the weight ratio of roast coffee beans to soluble coffee particles is less than 5:1, more preferably of from 4:1 to 1:4, preferably 3:1 to 1:3, and most preferably 2:1 to 1:2. The coffee beans used can be of any type. The main coffee species used are Arabica beans and Robusta beans. Typically, mixtures of both can be used. These beans can be recognized as having a specified geographical origin, such as Brazil, Colombia, or Indonesia. The soluble coffee particles can be made by extraction from roast and ground coffee beans of any type. The soluble coffee particles can be produced from decaffeinated beans. In an interesting embodiment, the soluble coffee particles are made by extraction from roast and ground coffee beans that, before grinding, have been used in the method of the invention, to impart coffee aroma to a previously produced batch of soluble coffee particles. The soluble coffee particles can be provided off the shelf, and then subjected to the process of the invention. Preferably, however, the invention is realized in a coffee production plant that produces both the soluble coffee particles and the roast whole coffee beans. In this embodiment, the invention pertains to a process for the preparation of aromatized soluble coffee particles, the process comprising providing a liquid coffee extract, drying the coffee extract so as to provide soluble coffee particles, mixing the soluble coffee particles with roast whole coffee beans, holding the mixture for at least two days, and separating the beans from the soluble coffee particles. Hereby, the preferences for holding times and ratio's are as mentioned before. The soluble coffee particles can be obtained from a liquid coffee extract by any concentration technique by which water is removed from said extract, particularly a coffee concentrate. These techniques generally are, e.g., freeze concentration, evaporation, or nanofiltration. This includes spray drying, drum drying, freeze drying, or extrusion. The dried soluble coffee particles generally have a residual moisture content in the range of from 1 wt. % to 5 wt. %, preferably 2 wt. % to 4%, most preferably about 3.5%. In addition to the specific step of the invention according to which the soluble coffee particles are aromatized, any other techniques available to the skilled person can be applied in order to add aromas to the soluble coffee particles. E.g., in making soluble coffee particles, it is possible to apply process streams by which aromas are obtained from coffee beans and/or from a coffee extract, and recirculate these aromas to the soluble coffee particles. A preferred process comprises producing a dried (particularly spray-dried or freeze-dried) coffee concentrate, wherein the concentrate is produced in accordance with the teaching in WO 2007/043873 or EP-A-0 352 842. The specific surface area of conventionally produced soluble coffee particles is generally in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 m 2 /gm. In an interesting embodiment, soluble coffee particles having a microporous structure may be used to promote adsorption of the aromas from the roast whole coffee beans. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, in all its aspects, the soluble coffee particles are obtained via freeze-drying. The coffee employed as a source for the extract from which the soluble coffee particles are made, as well as the whole roast coffee beans employed to impart aroma onto the soluble coffee particles, can be of the same or of a different roast. In connection with the embodiment wherein the whole roast beans, after being used for aroma generation according to the invention, are thereafter used for extraction, all coffee used is preferably of the same roast. The method of the invention, as substantially described hereinbefore, is particularly suitable for aromatizing soluble coffee particles with coffee aromas such that a detectable quantity of 2-methylpyrazine is present. Although 2-methylpyrazine is not the only aroma provided to the soluble coffee particles, it is believed to be a characteristic coffee aroma for fresh coffees that are appealable to the consumer. In connection herewith, it is important that the actual content of 2-methylpyrazine in the soluble coffee particles has a significant impact on the aroma of the instant coffee. As it is commonly known in the art, aroma refers to chemical compounds that have a smell or odor, and thus affect both the sense of taste and smell. Hence, in the context of the present invention, an aroma is a chemical compound which has a smell or odor because it is sufficiently volatile to be transported to the olfactory system in the upper part of the nose. Generally molecules meeting this specification have molecular weights of below 300. In particular, 2-methylpyrazine is such a volatile compound. It is generally accepted in the art to quantify such a compound in the headspace, i.e. the gaseous constituents of a closed space above liquids or solid emitting and vapors measured using headspace chromatography. Accordingly, the equilibrated headspace of the soluble coffee particles is measured which comprises at least 1.5 ng per ml headspace of 2-methylpyrazine, preferably at least 1.75 ng per ml headspace of 2-methylpyrazine, and most preferably at least 2.0 ng per ml headspace of 2-methylpyrazine. Hence, the present invention also concerns a product, i.e. the instant coffee comprising the soluble coffee particles as describes herein, in particular characterized by their surprisingly high content in 2-methylpyrazine of at least 1.5 ng per ml headspace of 2-methylpyrazine, preferably at least 1.75 ng per ml headspace of 2-methylpyrazine, and most preferably at least 2.0 ng per ml headspace of 2-methylpyrazine. In another aspect, the product is additionally characterized by the soluble coffee particles having an amount of oil of 0.8 to 4.5 wt. %, preferably 1.0 to 4.3 wt. %. It is a further important finding that the so characterised product of the present invention is capable to maintain these characteristics when stored which is representative for maintaining the desired improved aroma of the instant coffee. The product characteristics are maintained at least 3 months after preparation, preferably at least 6 months and even more preferably at least 24 months. In connection with the foregoing, the invention also concerns a process for the preparation of aromatized soluble coffee particles, wherein coffee aromas comprising 2-methylpyrazine is transferred to the soluble coffee particles by a method comprising providing soluble coffee particles, mixing the soluble coffee particles with roast whole coffee beans, allowing the mixture to stand for at least two days, and separating the beans from the soluble coffee particles. The foregoing embodiments and preferences, such as for holding time and ratio's, equally apply to this process. It is further preferred that the aromas, as evidenced by 2-methylpyrazine, are present in relatively high amounts compared to oil present. In yet another aspect, the invention resides in aroma-retaining soluble coffee particles obtainable by a process as substantially described, in any of the embodiments, hereinbefore. The invention also provides a new use of roast whole coffee beans. This is for providing soluble coffee particles with additional 2-methylpyrazine aroma, by a method as substantially described hereinbefore. In a still further aspect, the invention presents a use of roast whole coffee beans for the purpose of improving the aroma-retention of soluble coffee particles. This is realized by a method comprising providing a liquid coffee extract, drying the coffee extract so as to provide soluble coffee particles, mixing the soluble coffee particles with roast whole coffee beans, allowing the mixture to stand for at least two days, and separating the beans from the soluble coffee particles. The novel uses according to the invention, are preferably realized by means of any one of the embodiments of the methods described hereinbefore. The roast whole coffee beans in all of the aspects and embodiments of the invention can be of a light roast, of a medium roast, or of a dark roast. These terms have a known meaning to the skilled person. Preferably, the whole roast beans are of a dark roast. The invention will be further illustrated with reference to the following, non-limiting examples. Example 1 A batch of roasted Arabica beans was ground and from this ground coffee an extract was obtained according to WO2007/043873. This extract was concentrated and further freeze-dried to obtain soluble coffee particles. The yield of the process was approximately 45-50%, meaning that 2 kilograms of roasted coffee beans yields 1 kilogram of soluble coffee particles. The batch of soluble coffee particles was homogeneously mixed with a batch of roasted Arabica coffee beans in a weight ratio of coffee beans to soluble coffee particles of 2:1, and packed in an airtight container. The mixture was allowed to stand at 23° C. for 7 days. After 7 days of standing time the container was opened and the mixture was separated over a sieve to yield 1950 gram of whole coffee beans and 1040 grams of soluble coffee particles. The soluble coffee particles were packaged in an airtight container. After 3 months of storage at 23° C. the smell of the soluble coffee particles was assessed by a team of sensory experts. The smell of the soluble coffee particles was described as having roasted coffee notes. This was contributed to an increased level of 2-methylpyrazine. The soluble coffee particles had an oil concentration of 40 g/kg soluble coffee particles. The separated whole coffee beans were assessed as fit for extraction and where extracted according to WO2007/043873 to yield a liquid extract. This liquid extract could again be used to prepare soluble coffee particles. Example 2 In an experimental set-up as in Example 1, using 100% Arabica coffee, variations are made with respect to the ratio between whole roast beans and soluble coffee particles and the holding time, as summarized in Table 1 below. TABLE 1 Roast time beans Weight ratio Holding time Example (minutes) beans:particles (days) Smell 1 5.5 2:1 7 (+) 2a 5.5 2:1 3 (+) 2b 5.5 1:1 3 (+) 2c 5.5 1:1 7 (+) 2d 5.5 1:2 7 (+) *) all examples are based on soluble coffee having a storage time of 3 months. All examples result in soluble coffee particles that were evaluated positively in respect of smell, as having clear roasted coffee notes. Example 3 This example concerns a comparison with U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,931. In accordance with the teaching thereof, a coffee blend of 46% Arabica and 54% Robusta was subjected to roasting and grinding, extraction and spray drying, so as to provide soluble coffee particles. (a) A portion of the soluble coffee particles was mixed with a portion of roast and ground coffee having the above-mentioned blend, so as to have a ratio of roast and ground coffee to soluble coffee of 5:1. The mixture was held for 1 day (24 hours). (b) Another portion of the soluble coffee particles was mixed with a portion of roast whole coffee beans having the above-mentioned blend, so as to have a ratio of roast whole coffee beans to soluble coffee of 2:1. That mixture was held for 14 days (2 weeks). The same parameters were determined as in the preceding examples. The results are shown in Table 2.

The samples include the foregoing examples, as well as other samples produced in the same way, yet with further differentiation as to the type of coffee beans, the roasting process, and the drying process. An overview of the samples is given in Table 3 below. The samples were qualitative analysed by means of GC-MS as follows: 0.5 gram of instants coffee was weighted into a 10 mL vial. The sample was equilibrated for 15 minutes at 40° C. The headspace sample was concentrated using a 2.5 mL SPDE syringe 1 mL of the content of the syringe was desorbed on a Trace Quadrupole GC-MS. GC analysis was conducted split less in full scan mode using a Varian VF-1 ms 30 m×0.25 mm×1 um column. 2-methylpyrazine was identified by means of reference standard, and peak areas were reported. Differences between analysis runs were corrected with a reference sample from the previous runs. Method to Determine Oil Level The oil levels were determined by means of a Soxhlet extraction. Therefore 5 gram of instant coffee was dissolved in 150 mL of boiling water and the obtained solution was passed over a filter with 6 g celite 545. The filter was collected and dried for 16 hours at room temperature and 1 hour in a drying stove operating at 103° Celcius. Subsequently, the dried filter was collected in an extraction thimble from Schleicher & Schuell BioScience GmbH and 150 mL hexane was added as extraction medium. The sample was extracted and dried with a Gerhart Soxterm operating at 180° C. The dried product was weighted and the oil level was expressed in gram per 100 gram of instant coffee.

All 2-methylpyrazine levels are expressed in peak areas divided by 10 7 . Example 5 This example concerns the determination of a set of characteristics which significantly contribute for the final good and long retained aroma of the instant coffee according to the present invention. Therefore, quantitative levels of marker substance 2-methylpyrazine and the percentage oil level in the soluble coffee particles in instant coffee particles are determined by means of the analytic oil method as described above and the quantitative 2-methylpyrazine method as described below. Quantitative Analytical Method for 2-Methylpyrazine 2-Methylpyrazine headspace concentrations were determined by means of an indirect external calibration of the headspace concentration using a reference standard of 2-Methylpyrazine. Therefore a working solution of 1096 mg per liter 2-Methylpyrazine was obtained by dissolving 2-Methylpyrazine in pentane. This working solution was further diluted with pentane to obtain 6 calibration solutions of 7 μg/ml up to 1096 μg/ml. A calibration curve was made by liquid injection of 1 μL of the diluted working solutions on a simulated on-column PTV injector. Subsequently, the headspace concentration of a known 2-Methylpyrazine solution was determined by dissolving 610 mg per 50 mL of the standard 2-Methylpyrazine in polyethyleenglycol. This stock solution was 10 times diluted with water and from this solution 300 μL was added to 2700 μL water into a 20 mL vial and equilibrated for 15 minutes at 30° C. The headspace concentration of the known 2-Methylpyrazine solution was determined by injecting 1 mL of the static headspace above the solution and calculating the liquid/headspace partition coefficient. From the liquid/headspace partition coefficient the concentration 2-Methylpyrazine in ng/mL headspace (HS) was calculated. Quantification was performed with SPDE-HS-GC-FID using a Agilent VF-WAXms 30 m×0.25 mm×1 μm column. Therefore 4 gram of instant coffee was weighted into a 20 mL vial and the sample was equilibrated for 15 minutes at 30° C. The headspace of the sample was concentrated using a 2.5 mL SPDE syringe and 1 mL of the content of the syringe was desorbed on a GC-FID. The samples include the foregoing examples, yet with further differentiation as to the above specified characteristics, including reference samples according to U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,931. Other samples are added, based on Example 4, and further having the following manufacturing characteristics: Example 5a: weight ratio beans:particles of 1:2, holding time of 6 days; Example 5b: weight ratio beans:particles of 1:1, holding time of 7 days. The results are depicted in Table 4. The columns in Table 4 have been indicated with letters A and I to L as follows: TABLE 4 A I J K L 1 4.41 4.3 3.70 0.08 2a 3.57 4.4 3.11 0.09 2b 2.55 2.3 1.98 0.06 2c 3.38 2.3 3.01 0.06 2d 2.26 2.0 1.85 0.06 3b 1.76 4.3 1.83 0.18 4a 2.10 2.1 1.69 0.09 4b 1.63 1.8 0.81 0.06 4c 1.28 0.7 0.71 0.05 4d 1.95 1.7 1.12 0.04 3a 0.75 5.6 0.90 3.47 4i 0.08 0.4 0.19 0.05 4j 0.03 0.3 0.04 0.05 5a 2.49 1.4 n.d. 0.12 5b 5.06 2.7 n.d. 0.13 These results show, that the method of the present invention leads to a product which fulfils the quantitative requirements with regard to the specific characteristics which were found to be decisive for the aroma of instant coffee. This becomes even more evident when the characteristics of the instant coffee according to the present invention are compared to those corresponding characteristics of product according to the prior art U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,931. The results of the product according to the prior art U.S. Pat. No. 1,836,931 clearly indicate that such a product, which has not been prepared according to the present invention, does not at all fulfil the characteristics which are required to obtain an instant coffee with a particular good and retained aroma. Example 6 This example concerns the determination of a further characteristic which contributes to the good aroma and the reconstitution ability of the instant coffee, i.e. the percentile content of roast and ground coffee in the instant coffee. As explained above, roast and ground coffee is insoluble in contrast to the soluble coffee particles, and is determined by physical separation from the coffee solution by art-known means and then gravimetrically analysed. Method R&G Parts in Instant The contents R&G parts in instant coffee were determined by means of a filtration. Depending on the amount of roast and ground coffee in the instant coffee, 1-10 gram instant coffee was dissolved in 200 mL of boiling demineralized water and was kept at 95° Celcius for 20 minutes. Subsequently, the coffee solution was passed over a dried nylon filter with a known weight and a mesh size of 15 μm (Kabel Zaandam) using a Sartorius stainless steel pressure filter holder with a diameter of 50 mm and a content of 200 mL. The filter was collected and dried for 1 hour in a drying stove operating at 103° Celcius. The dried product was weighted and the content R&G parts was expressed in gram per 100 gram of instant coffee. An instant coffee prepared according to the present invention involving a coffee beans to coffee particle ratio of 1:1 and a holding time of 7 days exhibited a content of roast and ground coffee in the instant coffee of only 0.13 wt. %, which is below the lower envisaged limit of 0.5 wt. % and far below what instant coffee of the prior art or marketed products typically feature. Example 7 This example concerns the determination of aroma retention during open shelf-life of instant coffee. A test is conducted as follows, using an initially closed and sealed container (a glass jar) comprising 200 g of instant coffee, said container provided with a reclosable cover. Directly after breaking the seal and opening the container, i.e., without delay and without any stirring of the instant coffee, the instant coffee is scooped, using a tea spoon, into three glass tubes until each tube is filled with 10 g of instant coffee. From at least one of these tubes a quantity of 4 g of instant coffee is taken, and this sample is subjected to the aforementioned quantitative analysis for 2-methylpyrazine. After taking the quantity of coffee (which is denoted “0 OP” for an open shelf-life of zero), the instant coffee is firmly stirred with a teaspoon for a period of 10 seconds. Thereafter, the instant coffee is shaken for another period of 10 seconds, after which the cover is closed. The stirring and shaking for, in total, 20 seconds serves to replace the headspace of the instant coffee. After 24 hours standing time, the container is opened again. Exactly the same procedure is repeated, i.e. taking a second series of three samples of instant coffee of 10 g each, stirring and shaking the instant coffee for, in total, 20 seconds, and closing the cover. A quantity of 4 g of this second series of samples of instant coffee is subjected to the aforementioned quantitative analysis for 2-methylpyrazine. The test is repeated daily from day 3 until day 6. It is noted that, as a result of the stirring and shaking, the test presents an accelerated method for open shelf-life as compared to real-life storage. I.e., it is to be expected that during the test period a reduction of the aroma can be observed. The coffee used is prepared in analogy with that of Example 5b, with an initial oil level of 2.8 wt. %. The results are depicted in Table 5. The letters therein have the following meaning TABLE 5 M N 0 5.06 1 3.66 2 3.24 3 2.58 4 1.44 5 0.92 The results show that the instant coffee of the invention retains a desired aroma level of at least 1.5 ng 2-methylpyrazine per ml headspace for at least 3 days of accelerated open shelf-life.","20190191733"

No. 10/272,968, filed Oct. 17, 2002, now abandoned which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/345,234, filed Oct. 19, 2001, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to liquid coffee concentrates, methods of producing and assessing the quality of liquid coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Consumers produce the traditional “pot of coffee” by extracting the desired components of roast and ground coffee using an automatic drip coffee maker (ADC) or other form of brewer. Although the flavor and aroma of such a coffee beverage is highly desired and appreciated, the inconvenience of the brewing process has lead to the development of instant coffee and coffee concentrate products that allow the consumer to quickly make a single cup of coffee. Unfortunately, the production processes used to produce such coffee products result in finished products having ratios of flavor and aroma components that are different from fresh brewed coffee. As a result, coffee beverages produced from such concentrated products do not have the highly desired flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee. Since the flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee is especially desired by consumers, attempts have been made to improve the flavor and aroma of products made from coffee concentrates. Such attempts include incorporating volatile aroma flavor components into the finished concentrates, and the intensification of such components by the application of thermal energy. While such attempts are appreciated, there remains a need for a liquid coffee concentrate having the same ratios of flavor and aroma components as that of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the coffee concentrate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicant's invention relates to a liquid coffee concentrate having a furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value that is from about 50% to about 210% of the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Applicants also claim methods of producing and assessing the quality of coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. DETAILED DESCRIPTION A. Definitions As used herein, the term “coffee product” includes, but is not limited to coffee concentrates, coffee extracts and fresh brewed coffee. As used herein, the term “coffee concentrate” means a coffee extract that has undergone additional processing, such as thermal treatment. As used herein, the term “pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's pyridine and 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting pyridine's peak area value is divided by said 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran's peak area value. As used herein, the term “furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's furfuryl acetate and 4-ethyl guaiacol peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting furfuryl acetate's peak area value is divided by said 4-ethyl guaiacol's peak area value. As used herein, the term “unit operation” includes, but is not limited to, equipment used to transfer heat such as heaters and coolers; holders; and transfer lines. All percentages and ratios are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, the articles a and an, when used in a claim, are understood to mean at least one of the components that are claimed or described. Publications, patents, and patent applications are referred to throughout this disclosure. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. B. Coffee Concentrate Characteristics and Preparation The quality of any ready-to-use coffee product, made from a coffee concentrate, is dependent on the properties of the concentrate. Although coffee concentrates contain innumerable aroma and flavor components, Applicants discovered that the flavor and aroma of products made from concentrate approaches that of fresh brewed coffee when the concentrate's ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol approaches the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the concentrate. In addition to discovering the correlation between the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol, and flavor and aroma, Applicants discovered that a coffee concentrate's ratio of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol can be adjusted by the application of thermal energy to the concentrate. While evaluating the suitability of thermal processing, Applicants discovered that the entire, rather than just the hold tube portion, of a time and temperature profile must be considered. Applicants also recognized that the suitability of any set of thermal processing conditions is not only time and magnitude dependent but rate dependent as well. As a result, more common thermal processing descriptors such as Fo are insufficient to describe the thermal processing conditions that will result in the flavor and aroma improvements of Applicants' invention. Thus, Applicants' processing conditions are described in terms of equivalent times and temperatures, as thermal processing conditions that are time, magnitude and rate dependent can be effectively and efficiently described by these descriptors. A detailed description of Applicants' coffee concentrate and processes of making said concentrate is set forth in detail below. 1. Coffee Concentrate Embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 50% to about 210% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 65% to about 150% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Still other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 80% to about 120% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. 2.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a method for preparation of a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, using a predetermined amount of coffee grounds. The invention furthermore relates to a corresponding, fully automatic, coffee machine which may be of the piston-type. Fresh coffee-based beverages can be produced in the standard way, for example with a filter coffee machine. In addition, fresh coffee-based beverages can also be prepared with the aid of piston-type machines (so-called specialty machines). Insulated containers with a corresponding warming unit are necessary to keep larger amounts of filtered coffee ready for use. Piston-type machines produce coffee-based beverages with a high share of turbid and suspended materials, which are not desirable for a typical filtered coffee. The reason for this is that piston-type machines push the complete beverage amount with high pressure through a brewing unit, wherein a small amount of hot water, which is clearly lower than the amount guided through the brewing unit, is added later on if necessary, for example via a bypass line. The turbid and suspended materials dissolved out of the coffee grounds during this process then enter the beverage ready for drinking. These turbid and suspended materials, however, are desired for products prepared with a piston-type machine, for example for espresso and Schümli products (wherein beans by Julia Schümli are especially desired for these products). For that reason, these types of machines could not, so far, be used for the preparation of products similar to filtered coffee. German patent document DE 44 09 030 C2 describes a method for the production of a coffee-based beverage, as well as a suitable coffee machine provided with a bypass. The coffee-based beverage is prepared using a predetermined amount of ground coffee and a coordinated amount of hot water, wherein only a portion of the hot water is guided through the coffee grounds for the extraction and then flows into a storage container. The remaining partial amount bypasses the coffee grounds and flows directly into the storage container. The amount flowing through the bypass line is controlled such that at all times a drinkable coffee quality exists inside the storage container. An attempt is made with this method to compensate for fluctuations in the coffee strength during the brewing process. One known option for preparing a cold coffee-based beverage is the preparation of a specialty coffee, preferably an espresso, with the aid of a piston-type machine and subsequently pouring it over ice cubes. This type of preparation is characterized by the combination of ice cubes with a smaller amount of coffee, wherein the special drinking experience above all is based on the existing, non-melted ice. With a different method for preparing a cold coffee-based beverage, for example, regular filtered coffee is produced with a filter coffee machine and is then filled into containers in which it is allowed to cool down to room temperature over a longer period of time. The coffee cooled down in this way is then removed from the containers and, if applicable, is served while filled with ice. These types of beverages, however, are no longer fresh at the time when they are dispensed because of the relatively long cooling down period. The aforementioned method furthermore requires the storage of large amounts of brewed filter coffee since the cooling down period is relatively long, wherein furthermore cooling agents for keeping the beverage cool can require additional energy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for producing a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, and to provide an improved coffee machine for use with this method. According to the intention, a freshly brewed cold coffee-based beverage may be prepared with the aid of a coffee machine, for example, a piston-type coffee machine (specialty coffee machine), by freshly preparing a small amount of warm, extremely concentrated extract of coffee and mixing it proportionally with an excessive amount of cold water, so as to prepare a pleasantly cool, drinkable coffee-based beverage which has a dry substance share and taste that generally obtained with filtered coffee. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provide a method for producing a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage using a predetermined amount of ground coffee, which in one embodiment includes: feeding a predetermined amount of ground coffee into a brewing chamber; preparing a coffee concentrate with the supplied predetermined amount of ground coffee with a brewing operation in the brewing chamber, wherein the prepared coffee concentrate constitutes a specifiable multiple (VK) of a concentration (KN) for a normal drinking quality for filtered coffee at approximately 1.2 to 1.4% dry substance share; and mixing the prepared coffee concentrate with an amount of water which corresponds to a specifiable multiple (VM) of the amount of the prepared fresh coffee concentrate to prepare the fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an automatically controlled coffee machine for preparing a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, which in one embodiment includes: a storage container for ground coffee or whole-bean coffee ground as needed with a grinding device; a pressure-control device to provide a required water pressure; a brewing chamber to prepare fresh coffee concentrate from the ground coffee; a metering device to meter the ground coffee from the storage device or the grinding device into the brewing chamber; a hot water feeding tube connected to the brewing chamber to pre-brew and brew the coffee concentrate; a monitoring unit to determine a concentration for the brewed coffee concentrate; a beverage dispenser connected to the brewing chamber to dispense the brewed coffee concentrate; a cold water feeding tube connected to the dispenser; and a mixing chamber to mix the coffee concentrate with the cold water. The coffee machine may be a piston-type coffee machine. The coffee machine may comprises a beverage outlet connected to the brewing chamber and the cold water feed-in for dispensing fresh coffee-based beverages, preferably in individual portions or multiple portions to be dispensed either directly or to be stored in a container as available supply. By dispensing a freshly prepared cold beverage, the freshness aspect is clearly improved as compared to the traditional method. Furthermore achieved is a considerable reduction in the required storage volume and the number of components needed for cooling down cold coffee-based beverages since the beverages are prepared as need-based. As a result of the mixing with cold water, preferably tap water, an active cooling of the beverage is not required during the preparation of a fresh, cold coffee-based beverage and no waiting or cooling period is necessary. The temperature of the dispensed fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage is approximately the temperature of the available cold water, wherein the dispensing temperature is preferably at most about 15° C., even more preferable at most about 10° C. and especially preferred at most about 5° C. above the cold water temperature. Preparing the extremely small amount of hot coffee concentrate, as compared to the amount of hot coffee prepared during a normal brewing operation, requires a considerably lower amount of energy for cooling a fresh cold coffee-based beverage as compared to the traditional method. In addition, the handling of the process (filling of the supply container, removal of the used coffee grounds) is clearly simplified. For the desired output amount, a predetermined amount of ground coffee is guided into the brewing chamber, for example by freshly grinding coffee beans in a grinder or by using already ground coffee. This so-called coffee cake, however, is not pressed for the brewing operation. The brewing operation starts with a pre-brewing inside the brewing chamber, without pressure, during a specifiable limited time period and at a specifiable temperature. A brewing operation is subsequently carried out with the pre-brewed amount of coffee grounds and at a specifiable pressure, wherein the hot water pressure should amount to less than 2 bar. The brewing operation is stopped before the concentration of the brewed coffee concentrate is below a specifiable multiple of the concentration of a normal drinking quality for filtered coffee, with approximately 1.2 to 1.4% share of dry substance. The specifiable multiple of the concentration amounts to at least five times the concentration used for normal drinking quality. The coffee concentrate prepared in this way is then mixed with cold water until the desired beverage level is reached. Fresh tap water or water cooled to a specified temperature is mixed in for preparing a fresh cold coffee-based beverage. The cold water can furthermore be supplied from a correspondingly cooled storage container, wherein this water can preferably have a temperature of less than about 35° C., especially preferred of less than about 20% C, or even more preferred a temperature in the range of about 10° C. to about 0° C. A fresh cold coffee-based beverage can thus be prepared immediately. Following the complete extraction of the coffee cake, the pressed-out coffee cake is subsequently removed from the brewing chamber and place into a suitable container. According to an embodiment of a coffee machine according to the invention there may be provided a hot-water feeding tube to the brewing chamber and a cold-water feeding tube to the beverage dispenser.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The same components or functional units having the same function are given the same reference numbers in the Figures. FIG. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a piston-type coffee machine 1 that may be used to implement the invention. The embodiment of the coffee machine 1 in FIG. 1 includes a storage device 2 for storing the ground coffee which may be provided with a metering device 5 , a brewing chamber 3 with an extraction device, a hot water feeding tube 19 preceded by a heating unit 8 and followed by a hot water valve 11 a , a cold water feeding tube 20 followed by a cold water valve 12 , a beverage outlet 23 , a container 7 and a control unit 10 . The control unit 10 is connected to all sensors and actuators (not shown herein) and controls the coffee machine with the aid of commands input by an input device (not shown herein), or pre-programmed with specifiable parameters and sequences that can be adjusted from the outside. A cold water feeding tube 25 of the hot-water line 19 is provided with a pressure control device 15 . A concentration sensor 17 may be arranged on or in the brewing chamber 3 . Devices 26 , 27 for measuring the amounts can be provided in the hot water feeding tube 19 or in the cold water feeding tube of the hot water line 25 , and in the cold water feeding tube 20 , as well as in the metering device 5 . The brewing chamber 3 , the hot water feeding tube 19 and the cold water feeding tube 20 can furthermore be provided with temperature sensors, not shown herein, which are connected to the control unit 10 . The hot water valve 11 a with intake and the cold water valve 12 with its intake areas are jointly connected to a water supply system 18 . The preparation of a fresh cold coffee-based beverage is described in the following. To prepare a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, a desired amount of ground coffee is first moved from the storage device 2 via the metering device 5 , which may be arranged between the storage device 2 and the brewing chamber 3 , into the brewing chamber 3 . A coffee concentrate is then prepared in the brewing chamber 3 through an initial pre-brewing operation with a specifiable amount of hot water supplied by the hot water feeding tube 19 at a specifiable temperature. For this, the hot water valve 11 a or 11 b is opened, for example electromagnetically, by the control unit 10 . Tap water then flows from the tap water system 18 into the heating unit 8 , to be heated up. The heated up water then flows into the brewing chamber 3 . The ground coffee in the brewing chamber 3 is also referred to as coffee cake and is not pressed. The pre-brewing occurs without pressure. A feed-in pressure of the hot water is monitored by the pressure-control device 15 . The control unit 10 controls the feeding of the required amount of hot water via the hot water valve 11 a or 11 b which can be a control valve. This pre-brewing operation takes place during a predetermined time period and is controlled by the control unit 10 . The pre-brewing operation is followed by a brewing operation in the brewing chamber 3 at a pressure of less than 2 bar, for example 1.8 bar. The hot water is guided under this pressure, which can be controlled by the pressure-control device 15 , via the hot water feeding tube 19 through the brewing chamber 3 which contains the ground coffee. As soon as the limit value, stored in the control unit for the amount to be brewed in dependence on the amount of ground coffee used, or until the concentration K of the prepared coffee concentrate determined via a concentration sensor 17 , has reached a specifiable limit value and drops below it, the control unit 10 stops the brewing operation in the brewing chamber 3 by interrupting the feed-in of the hot water. The specifiable limit value amounts to at least five times the limit value defined for the normal drinking quality of filtered coffee. This normal, defined drinking quality of filtered coffee relates to filtered coffee having a dry substance share of approximately 1.2 to 1.4%. Following the brewing operation or parallel to the brewing operation, the prepared coffee concentrate is replenished with fresh, cold water from the cold water feeding tube 20 until the desired beverage level is reached. The cold water temperature is preferably less than about 35° C., especially less than about 20° C. and especially preferred in the range of about 10° C. to about 0° C. This temperature can correspond to the temperature of tap water from the water supply system 18 , which supplies the cold water in this case, wherein additional cooling devices can also be provided. The temperature of the cold water can be monitored with the aid of temperature sensors, which are not shown herein. The coffee concentrate and the cold water are conducted to the beverage dispenser 23 and from there into a container 9 , for example into a cup or a storage container such as a carafe for coffee. The pressed out coffee cake is then discharged from the brewing chamber 3 via an outlet 24 into the container 7 , and the brewing chamber 3 is again ready for a new brewing operation. The brewing chamber 3 may also be in communication with a drain, as illustrated, for cleaning purposes. FIG. 2 contains a flow chart, showing an embodiment of a method according to the invention for preparing a fresh coffee-based beverage with the above-described coffee machine. In a first method step S 1 , a predetermined amount of ground coffee is filled into the brewing chamber 3 . In a second method step S 2 , a coffee concentrate is brewed with the supplied amount of ground coffee in the brewing chamber 3 , wherein the coffee concentrate prepared in this way amounts to multiple times V the concentration KN of the drinking quality for a normal filtered coffee with approximately 1.2 to 1.4% dry substance share. The coffee concentrate in this case is prepared with the aid of several partial steps. First, the predetermined amount of ground coffee is pre-brewed (S 2 - 1 ) without pressure during a specifiable, limited time period, and the brewing operation is then continued by pressing hot water at a specifiable pressure of less than 2 bar, e.g. 1.8 bar, through the coffee grounds inside the brewing chamber (S 2 - 2 ). In an additional partial step (S 2 - 2 - 1 ), a concentration K is determined for the coffee concentrate, either by comparing the amount of coffee grounds used and the volume flow of hot water to the specified values stored in the control unit or by comparing the value analyzed via a concentration sensor to the predetermined value stored in the control unit. The brewing operation is stopped (S 2 - 2 - 2 ) before the concentration K of the brewed coffee concentrate drops below a specifiable multiple VK, at least five times the amount, of the concentration KN for the normal drinking quality of filtered coffee with approximately 1.2 to 1.4% dry substance. A fresh, cold coffee-based beverage is prepared during a third method step S 3 by mixing the coffee concentrate, produced in this way, with an amount of water that corresponds to multiple times VM the amount of the produced fresh coffee concentrate. The invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiments, but can be modified within the framework of the attached claims. For example, it is conceivable that a user of the coffee machine can pre-select the output temperature of the fresh, cold beverage. It will be understood that the above description of the present invention is susceptible to various modifications, changes and adaptations, and the same are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the appended claims.","20100260907"

No. 11/381,622, filed May 4, 2006, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to coffee-derived surfactants. More specifically, this invention is directed to coffee-derived surfactants prepared by transesterification reactions of sugars and coffee oil. The coffee-derived surfactants are especially useful in the production of coffee oil emulsions for use with, or incorporation into, coffee products. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Soluble coffee, also referred to as instant coffee, is a convenient alternative to the more traditional roast and ground coffee (R&G). Instant coffees, however, often trade the robust flavor of the R&G bean for the convenience of quick preparation. Soluble coffee is typically made by extraction and thermal hydrolysis of roast and ground (R&G) coffee, followed by separation and drying of the extract. Often soluble coffees may have an imbalanced flavor and aroma due to the high degree of processing and associated losses. The high temperatures and pressures used in such processes often produce a lesser quality product as compared to traditional R&G coffee. The inferior quality of the soluble coffees has been a longstanding problem. U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,044 (Nov. 19, 1996) provides an emulsion preconcentrate which contains hydrolyzed coffee oil and a coffee aroma. Coffee oil is hydrolyzed using, for example, alkaline hydrolysis using a conventional saponification process for fats and oils. The hydrolyzed oils generally have melting points greater than about 30° C. After adding the appropriate coffee aroma, the emulsion preconcentrate is added to soluble coffee particles (e.g., instant coffee). Once the coffee beverage is prepared, a “[s]mall amount of oil may appear on the surface, particularly if the hydrolyzed oil contains high levels of glycerides or the soluble coffee product contains unhydrolyzed oil. However, the amount of oil on the surface is well within acceptable ranges; for example equivalent to or less than that which would appear on the surface of roast and ground coffee.” U.S. Pat. No. 4,044,162 (Aug. 23, 1977) provides a method of improving the flavor and aroma of decaffeinated coffee by contacting green coffee with sucrose during the caffeine extraction process. The sucrose is reported to replace natural sucrose removed or destroyed during caffeine extraction. U.S. Pat. No. 4,857,351 (Aug. 15, 1989) provides a method for treating coffee beans to improve flavor and aroma. One step in this process involves the treatment of partially roasted coffee beans with an alkaline solution at a temperature of about 4 to about 177° C.; a sugar can be added to the solution. U.S. Pat. No. 6,291,006 (Sep. 18, 2001) provides a so-called dissolution agent that can be added to coffee and other beverages. The dissolution agent preferably includes lecithin, propylene glycol, ethoxylated mono and diglycerides, and a sucrose fatty acid ester, combined with maltodextrin and water to make a binder solution. The dissolution agent is added to the beverage product normally at a level of about 0.2 to about 0.33 percent. There remains a need to provide an improved and more efficient method of producing soluble coffee that retains the robust coffee flavor and aroma similar to R&G coffee. There also remains a need to provide improved soluble coffee containing higher levels of coffee oils which, when prepared, do not form visible “oil-slicks.” SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to coffee-derived surfactants. More specifically, this invention is directed to coffee-derived surfactants prepared by transesterification reactions of sugars and coffee oil. The coffee-derived surfactants are especially useful in coffee products, including the production of coffee oil emulsions for use with, or incorporation into, coffee products. In especially preferred embodiments, this invention is directed to highly effective emulsifiers produced from coffee materials to facilitate the formulation of emulsions and foams in coffee products (e.g., instant coffee) and to increase the incorporation of coffee oil into coffee products with reduced formation of so-called “oil slicks.” The coffee-derived emulsifiers are prepared using a transesterification reaction to form sugar esters from coffee materials, especially coffee oils, and sugars (e.g., sucrose). In one embodiment, coffee oil, a non-reducing sugar (e.g., sucrose), and an alkaline catalyst (e.g., potassium carbonate) are reacted to provide a series of sugar monoesters. Sugars having reducing groups (e.g., mannose) can also be used in the present invention so long as the reducing groups are blocked (e.g., via alkylation of the reducing groups; see Example 7) prior to the transesterification reaction. For purposes of this invention, the term “sugar” is intended to include both non-reducing and reducing sugars; as noted, however, reducing sugars should be pre-modified by blocking the reducing groups prior to the transesterification reaction. It is generally preferred that the raw materials used to prepare the coffee-derived surfactants are themselves derived from coffee materials. Thus, for example, sucrose used in the transesterification reaction can be obtained from coffee materials (e.g., extracted from green coffee). Green coffee or other coffee material can be ashed and hydrated to provide an alkaline residue which can be used in place of the alkaline catalyst (e.g., potassium carbonate). The coffee-derived surfactants of this invention allow the incorporation of higher levels of coffee oils in instant type coffees and provide improved quality, reduced raw material costs, and reduced formation of “oil slicks” in instant type coffees. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention provides coffee-derived surfactants by alkaline catalyzed transesterification reactions of sugars with coffee materials. The resulting coffee-derived surfactants are especially useful in the preparation of coffee oil emulsions which can then be used in preparation of coffee beverages (especially soluble coffee beverages). The resulting coffee oil emulsions are less likely to form oil slicks, as compared to other means of adding coffee oils, in instant type coffees. Incorporating more coffee oils in instant coffee products using the coffee-derived surfactants of this invention allows for improved flavor and aroma which more closely mimics the desired robust coffee flavor and aroma in R&G coffee. Moreover, since the surfactants are prepared from coffee materials, non-coffee surfactants are not added to the coffee products. Coffee-derived surfactants are prepared by alkaline catalyzed transesterification reactions of sugars with coffee materials. Although not wishing to be limited by theory, it is thought that the coffee-derived surfactants produced in the present invention are largely a series of sugar monoesters formed during the transesterification reactions. Suitable coffee materials for use in the present invention include, for example, roast and ground coffee, coffee oils, spent (i.e., partially extracted) coffee grounds or coffee oils, coffee aqueous extracts, green coffee bean extracts, and the like as well as mixtures thereof; the extracts or other coffee materials may be concentrated if desired. Preferably, the coffee material comprises coffee oils. The sugars used in the present invention include monosaccharides (e.g., mannose, glucose, fructose, galactose and the like) and disaccharides (e.g., sucrose, lactose, maltose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like) as well as mixtures thereof. Non-reducing sugars (e.g., sucrose, trehalose) can be used directly in the transesterification reaction. Sugars having reducing groups (i.e., reducing sugars such as mannose, glucose, fructose, galactose, lactose, maltose, and cellobiose) must have their reducing groups blocked (see, e.g., Example 7) prior to being subjected to the transesterification reactions. Preferred sugars are obtained from coffee materials such as roast and ground coffee, spent (i.e., partially extracted) coffee grounds, coffee aqueous extracts, green coffee bean extracts, and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Sugars derived from coffee materials, since they mainly consist of sucrose, can be used in the transesterification reaction without any blocking pretreatment or preconditioning. Especially preferred coffee materials from which sugars can be derived include spent coffee grounds. Alkaline transesterification catalysts are used to form the desired transesterification products. Examples of such catalysts include K 2 CO 3 , KOH, NaOH, Na 2 CO 3 , KHCO3, NaHCO 3 , and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Suitable catalysts also can be prepared from coffee materials. Thus, for example, coffee materials can be ashed (e.g., in a furnace at about 700° C. or higher) to produce a mineral residue containing various alkaline salts for use as the transesterification catalyst. Generally, the transesterification reactions are carried out at about 130 to about 170° C. (preferably about 140 to about 160° C.) for about 4 to about 10 hours (preferably about 6 to about 8 hours) in a suitable solvent (e.g., dimethyl formamide and the like). The desired coffee-derived surfactants can be obtained from the reaction mixture by removing the solvent using conventional techniques (e.g., rotary evaporation). In other embodiments, the coffee materials can be treated prior to, or during, the transesterification reaction to, for example, increase the level of free fatty acids in the coffee material. Thus, for example, coffee oil can be partially hydrolyzed at about 200 to about 300° C. for about 1 to about 4 hours to increase the free fatty acids content. Subsequent treatment of coffee oil with alkaline transesterification catalysts may, in addition to catalyzing the transesterification reactions, further increase the free fatty acid content. The free fatty acids are typically present as alkaline salts. Increasing the fatty acid content of coffee materials, such as by partial hydrolysis of coffee oil, may beneficially increase the dispersability or functionality of the transesterification reaction products of this invention. Advantages and embodiments of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited therein, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit the invention. All parts, ratios, and percentages are by weight unless otherwise directed. All publications, including patents and published patent applications, are hereby incorporated by reference. EXAMPLE 1 An aqueous extract (4.5 liters) of green coffee beans having about 10 percent dissolved solids was adjusted to pH 4.5 by addition of phosphoric acid. The extract was then passed through a column containing Amberlite XAD-1180 resin; the resulting eluate was then passed through a column containing polyamide PSC-6 resin. The resulting eluate was then passed through each of the columns a second time and then collected. This combination of columns is thought to preferentially remove acids, phenolic compounds, and proteins and proportionately increase the sucrose concentration. Water was added to complete the elution of the coffee extract from the columns and added to the collected elute. The eluate was freeze dried and then extracted with ethanol (6× by volume at 80° C.). Rotary evaporation of the ethanol extract gave 6 g of pale yellow powder. Gas chromatography analysis of the powder following trimethylsilylation indicated that sucrose was the major component and was present at a concentration of over 80 percent. A mixture of sucrose fatty acid esters was produced by reacting the above-described sucrose preparation (3.5 g) with spent grounds coffee oil (6.0 g) in the presence of K 2 CO 3 (1 g) catalyst in a polar solvent (25 ml dimethyl formamide) by heating for 8 hours in a 135° C. oil bath. K 2 CO 3 was used to catalyze the transesterification reaction. K 2 CO 3 is not surface-active and does not become chemically part of the sucrose fatty acid ester molecules produced. The reaction yielded a solidified brown mass (10.5 g) after rotary evaporation to remove dimethyl formamide. The brown residue was then extracted with diethyl ether; the insoluble portion (containing K 2 CO 3 ) was discarded. The soluble portion, after removal of the diethyl ether by rotary evaporation, provided the solidified sucrose ester reaction product. Analysis using gas chromatography (GC) confirmed the formation of fatty acids corresponding to those present in coffee oil esters plus a series of peaks that eluted after sucrose. Analysis using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) identified these peaks as a series of sucrose monoesters. The solidified reaction product containing the sucrose monoesters was combined with an equal part of water using a Turrax homogenizer; an equal amount of coffee oil was then added and the mixture emulsified using the Turrax homogenizer to produce a coffee oil emulsion. A drop of the resulting coffee oil emulsion placed on the surface of hot water. The drop dispersed without producing a visible surface slick. When a similar amount of coffee oil is added to the surface of hot water, an oil slick is observed. EXAMPLE 2 Coffee oil (90 g), pressed from spent roasted coffee grounds obtained from a commercial soluble coffee process, was steam hydrolyzed by heating with water (10 g) at 250° C. for 2 hours in a sealed Parr bomb. Analysis indicated that the free fatty acid content of the partially hydrolyzed oil increased from 2.1 percent initially to 47.0 percent after treatment. The partially hydrolyzed coffee oil was used in Example 4. EXAMPLE 3 A mixture of sucrose fatty acid esters was produced by reacting sucrose (13.7 g) with spent grounds coffee oil (12.0 g) in the presence of K 2 CO 3 (4 g) catalyst by heating for 6 hours in dimethyl formamide at 140° C. K 2 CO 3 was used to catalyze the transesterification reaction. K 2 CO 3 is not surface-active and does not become chemically part of the sucrose fatty acid ester molecules produced. The reaction yielded a solidified brown mass (29.5 g). Analysis using gas chromatography (GC) confirmed the formation of fatty acids corresponding to those present in coffee oil esters plus a series of peaks that eluted after sucrose. Analysis using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) identified these peaks as a series of sucrose monoesters. It was estimated that about 5 percent of the sucrose was converted to sucrose monoesters under these unoptimized reaction conditions. The solidified reaction product was first combined with an equal part of water using a Turrax homogenizer; to this mixture was added an equal part of coffee oil which was emulsified using the Turrax homogenizer. A drop of the resulting (50/50) emulsion placed on the surface of hot water. The drop dispersed without producing a visible surface slick. For comparison purposes, sucrose (13.7 g) was combined with spent grounds coffee oil (12.0 g) in a beaker at room temperatures without an alkaline catalyst (e.g., K 2 CO 3 ). The mixture was combined with an equal part of water using a Turrax homogenizer and a drop of the resulting (50/50) unstable coarse emulsion placed on the surface of hot water. A very apparent brown spotty oil slick resulted. EXAMPLE 4 The process of Example 3 was essentially repeated using partially hydrolyzed spent grounds coffee oil (prepared in Example 2) in place of the spent grounds coffee oil. The reaction similarly produced a mixture of sucrose monoesters. EXAMPLE 5 Green coffee beans (50 g) were ashed in a furnace at 800° C. for one hour to produce a mineral residue (4 g) containing alkaline potassium salts. The ash (4 g) was contacted with spent grounds coffee oil at 140° C. for 6 hours to produce free fatty acids as an alternative to the use of K 2 CO 3 obtained from a non-coffee source. The ash can also be used as an alternative to K 2 CO 3 obtained from a non-coffee source to catalyze the transesterification reaction to form the surfactant compositions of this invention. Thus, this material could be used, for example, to replace the K 2 CO 3 catalyst of Example 1 to provide a surfactant composition prepared only from coffee-derived materials. EXAMPLE 6 Ethanol was produced from an aqueous extract of green coffee beans by microbial fermentation using yeast from the Saccharomyces genus. Such ethanol, which is derived from coffee materials, can be used with sugars containing reducing groups to “block” (e.g., alkylation of the reducing groups). Such ethanol, for example, could be used as described in Example 7 to produce coffee-derived surfactants; if combined with the coffee-derived catalyst of Example 5, surfactant compositions prepared only from coffee-derived materials could be obtained. EXAMPLE 7 A mixture of ethyl mannose fatty acid esters was produced by first reacting mannose (1.8 g) with ethanol (20 g) in the presence of Dowex cation-exchange resin in its H + form to catalyze production of ethyl mannose (2.1 g) and thereby blocking the reducing groups. Ethyl mannose (2 g) was then reacted with spent grounds coffee oil (3 g) in the presence of K 2 CO 3 (1 g) by heating for 6 hours in a 140° C. oil bath. K 2 CO 3 was used to catalyze the transesterification reaction. K 2 CO 3 is not surface-active and does not become chemically part of the ethyl mannose fatty acid esters produced. The reaction yielded a solidified brown mass (6 g). Analysis using gas chromatography (GC) confirmed the formation of fatty acids corresponding to those present in coffee oil esters plus a series of peaks that eluted after mannose. Analysis using LC-MS identified these peaks as a series of ethyl mannose monoesters. It was estimated that 0.5 percent of the mannose was converted to ethyl mannose monoesters under these unoptimized reaction conditions. The solidified reaction product was combined with an equal part of water using a Turrax homogenizer and a drop of the resulting (50/50) emulsion placed on the surface of hot water. The drop dispersed without producing a visible surface slick. For comparison purposes, mannose (1.8 g) was combined with spent grounds coffee oil (3.0 g) in a beaker at room temperatures without the use of an alkaline catalyst. The mixture was combined with an equal part of water using a PowerGen 700D mixer (Fisher Scientific) and a drop of the resulting (50/50) unstable coarse emulsion placed on the surface of hot water. A very apparent brown spotty oil slick resulted. EXAMPLE 8 Roasted spent coffee grounds were contacted with water at high temperature using a commercial thermal hydrolysis process to prepare an aqueous coffee extract having a high concentration of mannose. The resulting extract could be used in the place of mannose in Example 7 to prepare mannose monoesters using only coffee-derived materials. EXAMPLE 9 The sucrose monoester-containing reaction product (0.16 g) of Example 3 was combined with soybean oil (8.0 g), Maxwell House Instant Coffee powder (2.0 g), and water (7.84 g) and sheared using a PowerGen 700D mixer to produce a stable water-in-oil emulsion having average oil droplet size of 8 microns. EXAMPLE 10 The sucrose monoester-containing reaction product (1.6 g) of Example 3 was combined with Maxwell House Instant Coffee powder (2.0 g), and water (230 g) in a 12 ounce cup and whipped using a PowerGen 700D mixer at 20,000 rpm for 30 seconds to produce a foamed coffee beverage having the appearance of espresso.","8603562"

The complete text of these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a coated coffee particle and to various items made using such coated coffee particles. Further, the coated coffee particle may be formed into a structured coffee composition suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers can find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. Single serving coffee makers such as those by Hamilton Beach, Cuisinart, Mr. Coffee and others are generally designed to make a single cup of coffee (but can make slightly larger volumes) using a single use ground, or powered, coffee composition. In some instances, the coffee compositions used in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be powered in nature, in other instances the coffee compositions utilized in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be contained in what is typically viewed as a single use coffee “cup.” In this instance, such a coffee “cup” container/structure can contain, but does not require, a built-in filter element that lines the inside surface of such a single “use” coffee cup container/structure. It should be noted that although such coffee cup containers/structures are viewed as single use, the end user or consumer can, and often does, use such single use coffee cups more than once. Other forms of coffee makers and methods for preparing coffee include, but are not limited to, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced whereby various manufacturers provide coffee in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, are provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “containers,” “cups,” and/or “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are really only designed to brew a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tabletted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. Moreover, when roast and ground (R&G) coffee is exposed to air and/or sunlight for significant amounts of time, it goes stale overtime and exhibits papery notes that are evidence thereof. Further, roast and ground coffee must also be packaged in air tight packaging (e.g., wherein the removal of most oxygen must be purged therefrom) to avoid oxidation occurring thereon causing the roast and ground coffee to become stale. In light of the above and in view of the current products available in the marketplace, it would be desirable to develop a coffee composition and one or more items made therefrom that utilize a combination of instant coffee with one or more of roast coffee and/or ground coffee to achieve a coffee composition able to withstand exposure to air and light over some time without staling while still maintaining the product's integrity in combination with providing faster disassociation when brewed, thereby advantageously providing a variety of consistent coffee products of varying strengths with the ability to also use less robust packaging therefor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided are coated coffee particles and to various items made using the coated coffee particles. In another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particles can be formed into a structured coffee compositions suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use one or more of the present embodiments. The general principles described herein can be applied to embodiments and applications other than those detailed below without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Therefore, the present embodiments are not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed or suggested herein. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety as though they are fully set forth herein. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the numerical properties set forth in the following specification and claims are approximations that can vary depending on the desired properties sought to be obtained in embodiments of the present invention. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations; the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported with relative precision. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from error found in their respective measurements. As noted above, the present invention relates to coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to various coffee compositions and to a variety of items made using such coffee compositions wherein the coffee composition is in the form of coated particulates as disclosed herein. In yet another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particulates can be formed into any three-dimensional coffee structure suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, old brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. Terminology Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Non-Coffee Binder” means a material which improves the structural integrity of a coffee composition made in accordance with the present invention. “Non-Coffee Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc., or any one or more binders made from one or more coffee ingredients and some amount of water. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, liquid coffee concentrate, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. Ground roast coffee can also be referred to as “roast coffee, ground coffee, or even a combination of roast coffee and ground coffee”. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Coffee solids” means the coffee constituents that are extracted or extractable during the brewing of coffee. Unless indicated otherwise, the term coffee solids refers to both the dissolved coffee solids and suspended coffee solids (e.g., very small grinds or fines). “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee composition means that the coffee composition is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the composition, when the composition is in place in a brewing device so as to be contacted with water (hot, cold or any temperature therebetween) for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example, flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3 weight percent) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. Furthermore, instant coffee used in the present invention can be prepared by any convenient process, of which a variety of processes are known to those skilled in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Moreover, representative spray drying processes that can provide suitable instant coffee are disclosed in, for example, pages 382 through 513 of Sivetz & Foote, “Coffee Processing Technology,” Vol. I (Avi Publishing Co. 1963), U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,771,343, 2,750,998, and 2,469,553, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Other suitable processes for providing instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,436,227, 3,493,388, 3,615,669, 3,620,756, and 3,652,293, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. The instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention can be prepared form any single variety of coffees or a blend of different varieties, and can be decaffeinated or un-decaffeinated, and can be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic as necessary. Additionally, instant coffee has many forms: spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid. “Liquid coffee concentrate” or “liquid coffee extract” as used herein designates an aqueous extract of the roasted coffee beans wherein the solids content is substantially greater than used for direct consumption as a beverage. The coffee solids content may be from about 10 wt % to about 75 wt %. The term as used here indicates a concentrated coffee extract, irrespective of this being liquid or a solid deep frozen coffee concentrate. As is generally known coffee extracts are recovered by contacting roasted and ground coffee beans with water or an aqueous solution. On an industrial scale, the intention is to achieve high extraction efficiency leading to extraction of aroma substances, that is odorants and flavorings, from the ground coffee. The concentration method is not particularly limited and can be performed by a known method and apparatus, evaporation, membrane concentration, concentration under reduced pressure, freeze concentration, and the like. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3 grams to about 5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of espresso strength brewed coffee. In one embodiment, the present invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures can be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing can include about 70° C. to about 100° C., about 80° C. to about 99° C., about 85° C. to about 97° C., or about 90° C. to about 96° C. However, it is contemplated that brewing may take place in other brewers at high pressures of greater than 100° C. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce anywhere from about 4 to about 12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The coffee products of the present invention can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and can be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. For more information related to ADC brewers see, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Coated Coffee Particle The general inventive concepts encompass various embodiments that are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a coated coffee particle. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may include a ground roast coffee particle that is coated with a coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, and at least partially drying the granulated composition. Optionally, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure. Examples of coffee extracts for use in the solution of coffee extracts include, but are not limited to, liquid coffee concentrate and instant coffee. It has been found that by mixing a solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee and at least partially drying the granulated composition a plurality of coated ground roast coffee particles may be prepared. As used herein, the coated ground roast coffee particles may be referred to as coated coffee particles or coated particulates. Through the mixing of the solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee a portion of the ground roasted coffee is extracted. Accordingly, a matrix is formed that includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee on the ground roast coffee particles. Stated differently, the matrix is composed of compounds that originated from both the coffee exact and roast and ground coffee particles. In one or more embodiments, coffee exact may be prepared from an instant coffee, a liquid coffee concentrate, or a combination thereof. For the purpose of this specification, ground roast coffee particles that include a coating of the matrix or coffee extracts and extracts from the round roast coffee may be referred to as the coated ground roast coffee particles. The coating may also be referred to as a coffee extract and ground roast coffee extract matrix or simply the matrix. The coating at least partially covers the surface of the ground roast coffee particles and may fill in any cracks or crevices on the surface of the particle. The coating of the ground roast coffee particles may also bind the particles together to form a structured coffee composition. As indicated above, the matrix or coating of the ground roast coffee particles compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. This mixture may be experimentally shown via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR analysis shows a peak that corresponds with a wavelength of 940 nm in the coffee coating that is not present in coffee extracts such as those prepared from instant coffee. This peak is high in ground roasted coffee but is present in lower amounts in the coating. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the peak may be related to lipids present in the ground roast coffee, but it may also be a combination of lipids with other compounds that absorb in this region. Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/QTOF) analysis of the coffee coating and ground roast coffee particles, and the coffee extracts may also be used to show compositional differences. For example, coffee extracts such as instant coffee have an extremely low amount of lipids and a different compositional background compared to roast and ground coffee. The presence of high amounts of lipids and/or composition similar to roast and ground coffee but different from instant would indicate a solvent was used. Further, visual appearance of the coating through by surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy or other surface measuring techniques may be used to identify that the coating of coffee extracts was added using a solvent. Visual appearance may also suggest that a solvent was used. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of problems solved, the coated coffee particle advantageously provides a solution to one or more of the following problems: (a) fast disassociation in hot or cold water; (b) the creation of a larger surface area via capillary action creating void spaces due to solution of the instant component; (c) significantly higher percentages brew solids (BS) are achieved with less coffee weight and volume; (d) delivery of improved brew profile and rich color early in brew; (e) consistent results across a full range of brew methods (i.e., ADC, single serve, French Press, cup infuser, cold brew); (f) the structured coffee composition may be prepared with 100 percent coffee or coffee related flavorings/additives; (g) coffee flavor of instant coffee portion of the composition is enhanced by extraction of flavor notes from ground roast component; (h) cold brewing can be achieved with significantly less volumes of coffee and shorter brew times (e.g., about 2 to about 4 hours or about 2 to about 3 hours for a pitcher); and (i) the product stays fresher longer (less staling perception) when stored in low barrier packaging. Ingredients: Ground Roast Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be prepared from ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “ Arabica ( s )”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “ Robusta ( s )”). See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in its entirety. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of ground coffees produced from the coffee beans discussed above can be used to make the structured coffee composition. Further, mixtures of two or more different varieties, or types, of ground coffees described above can also be used in combination to prepare the structured coffee composition. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12 weight percent. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology , “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112 to 169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. In other embodiments, the coffee been may be “pre-dried” prior to roasting. In these or other embodiments, the coffee beans may be dried to a moisture content in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Exemplary methods of pre-drying a coffee bean are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,160,757 and 5,322,703 and which are both incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. This drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional or low moisture drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at a temperature in the range of about 70° F. to about 325° F. (21° C. to 163° C.), or from about 90° F. to about 300° F., or from about 120° F. to about 275° F., or even from about 160° F. to about 250° F. over drying times lasting about 1 minute to about 24 hours, or from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, or from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, or from about 3 hours to about 6 hours, or even from about 4 hours to about 5 hours. After drying the green coffee beans (and optionally pre-drying the coffee beans), the coffee beans to are typically processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of the present invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans can be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8° C. to about 371.1° C. (about 350° F. to about 700° F.), or about 176.8° C. to about 260° C. (about 350° F. to about 500° F.), or about 204.4° C. to about 232.2° C. (about 400° C. to about 450° F.), or about 260° C. to about 287.8° C. (about 500° C. to about 550° F.), or about 315.6° C. to about 348.9° C. (about 600° C. to about 660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and can, for example, be about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or about 12 minutes to about 18 minutes, or can be about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 6 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 4 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and can, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1 minutes to about 3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° F. to about 1200° F. (about 177 C to about 649° C.), or from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, or from about 10 seconds to about 47 seconds. As is well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer ., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee that is used to make the structured coffee composition can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, or from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, or even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as about 250 μm (microns) and as high as about 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of about 400 μm to about 2,500 μm, or from about 500 μm to about 2,400 μm, or from about 650 μm to about 2,200 μm, or from about 800 μm to about 2,000 μm, or from about 900 μm to about 1,00 μm, or from about 1,000 μm to about 1,600 μm, or from about 1,200 μm to about 1,400 μm, or even about 1,300 μm. The coffee beans can be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to about 1.5 mm, or from about 300 μm to about 1,600 μm, or even from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles can be broken down during three-dimensional shape molding, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the molded structure formed from the various coffee compositions described herein. In one or embodiments, the size of the ground roast coffee particles may be described with reference to the size range of the coffee typically employed for a particular brewing method. In one or more embodiments, the ground roast coffee particles may be a coarse grind typically used for French press or percolator coffee brew, for example (e.g., about 900 microns to about 1400 microns), a medium-coarse grind typically used for pour over brewers, flat bottom drip brewer or ADC, or Aeropress, for example, (e.g., about 800 microns to about 1200 microns), a medium grind typically used for clever dripper, café solo, or single serve brewer, for example, (e.g., about 500 microns to about 900 microns), a medium fine grind typically used for Turkish coffee, for example, (e.g., about 200 microns to about 550 microns) or a super fine grind typically used for espresso, or moka pot, for example (e.g., about 200 microns to about 450 microns), or any one or more combinations thereof based on the desired type of coffee beverage and coffee strength. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by full particle size distribution curve. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than about 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. In one or more embodiment the roast ground coffee particles may be prepared using mill flaking. Mill flaking technology or mill flaking is a unique grinding process that creates a larger surface area on each flake for hot water to easily extract more of our coffee flavor. Flaked coffee is further disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,676, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/mL to about 0.35 g/mL such as, for example, about 0.263 g/mL, about 0.288 g/mL, about 0.325 g/mL, or even about 0.35 g/mL, if desired. Alternatively, the structured coffee composition can also be made for ground roast coffees having lower or higher densities, if desired. For example, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from high density coffees having densities of greater than about 0.40 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of up to about 0.60 g/cm 3 , although even higher densities are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. Similarly, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from low density coffees having densities of less than about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 to about 0.25 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.22 g/cm 3 to about 0.23 g/cm 3 (such as about 0.19 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 , about 0.21 g/cm 3 , about 0.22 g/cm 3 , about 0.23 g/cm 3 , about 0.24 g/cm 3 or even about 0.25 g/cm 3 ). Furthermore, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from higher density coffees having densities from about 0.39 g/cm 3 to about 0.57 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.40 g/cm 3 to about 0.56 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.46 g/cm 3 to about 0.48 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.47 g/cm 3 . In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3.5 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.75 to about 4.25 weight percent. In one instance, the inventive coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.6 weight percent, or from about 2.85 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or even from about 4.5 weight percent to about 4.85 weight percent. Generally speaking, the structured coffee composition can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, in one embodiment it is desirable that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular,” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. In another instance, embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the coffee compositions of the present invention is/are decaffeinated are also within the scope of the present invention. In one or more embodiments, the amount of one or more ground roast coffees (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the structured coffee composition used are in the range of about 60 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, or from about 65 weight percent to about 87.5 weight percent, or from about 70 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, or from about 72.5 weight percent to about 82.5 weight percent, or from about 75 weight percent to about 80 weight percent even about 77.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Instant Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include instant coffee. The instant coffee may be used to form a slurry in the preparation of the structured coffee composition by adding water to an instant coffee. The slurry is then combined with roast and ground coffee. It has been found that when an instant coffee is included in the structured coffee composition, the instant coffee may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. The presence of instant coffee in coffee compositions and/or structures can be detected by a number of different methods. However, one method is described in R. M. Noyes and C. M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee product to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. See various methods of detecting presence of instant coffee also as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different instant coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the method of which the instant coffee is prepared and other factors. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of less than 7 weight percent, or less than 6.5 weight percent, or less than 6 weight percent, or of less than 5.5 weight percent, or of less than 5 weight percent, or less than 4.5 weight percent, or of less than 4 weight percent, or less than 3.5 weight percent, or of less than 3 weight percent. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of about 0.5 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.5 to about 4.25 weight percent. Suitable instant coffee for use in the structured coffee composition include, but are not limited to, spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid instant coffees. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the yield of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high yield instant coffee, a medium yield instant coffee, or a low yield instant coffee. High yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of greater than 45%. High yields instant coffees may be obtained using a primary and then a secondary extract with high water temperatures. Typically, high yield instant coffees include a high robusta content to maximize extraction yield. Medium yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of between 25% to 45%. Typically, medium yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content with a minimal robusta content. Low yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of less than 25%. Low yield instant coffees may be obtained using only a primary extraction at temperatures generally at or below 100° C. Typically, low yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%). In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the quality of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high quality instant coffee or a low quality instant coffee. High quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that produce a cup of brewed coffee with an aroma similar to a roast and ground coffee and have a flavor with minimal processed and Carmel notes. Typically, high quality instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%) and are produced at a low extraction yield. Low quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that have a dull or unexciting flavor that may taste stale. Typically, low quality instant coffees include a high robusta content and are produced at a high extraction yield. In some embodiments a low yield, high quality instant coffee is used. In another embodiment a high yield instant coffee is used. The structured coffee composition may employ a variety and types of instant coffee can be used, including a high yield, high quality instant coffee, a high yield, low quality instant, or a low yield, low quality instant, or one or more combinations thereof any one or more instant coffee varieties and types of instant coffee. Exemplary instant coffees can be used with the present invention to make the coffee composition, including but not limited to, those as shown below in Table 1.

In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee that may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, instant coffees may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Liquid Coffee Concentrate As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include a liquid coffee concentrate. Liquid coffee concentrates may be purchased commercially or prepared prior to inclusion in the structured coffee composition. It has been found that when a liquid coffee concentrate is included in the preparation of a structured coffee composition, the liquid coffee concentrate may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. In one or more embodiments, a liquid coffee concentrates may be prepared by concentrating the draw-off stream from a liquid extraction process. This process utilizes hot and/or cool water and and/or steam to extract soluble coffee from roast and ground coffee. The liquid stream may then be concentrated by either thermal evaporation or freeze concentration or an alternate method. The concentrated stream of liquid coffee extract can be utilized to create a slurry, or with a roast and ground coffee with or without adding additional process water. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. An exemplary liquid coffee concentrate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,113,643, which is incorporated herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, a commercially available liquid coffee concentrate may be employed in the structured coffee composition. Liquid coffee concentrate is often sold in frozen form, and may be thawed prior to being combined with roast and ground coffee. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be characterized by the percent of coffee solids in the total volume of the liquid coffee concentrate. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may have coffee solids in an amount of about 10% to about 75%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 15% to about 70%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 20% to about 65%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 25% to about 60%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 30% to about 58%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 35% to about 55%, and in other embodiments in an amount of about 40% to about 50%. The amount of liquid coffee concentrate that may be included in the structured coffee composition should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least property such as binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, and staling resistance. In one or more embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on the overall weight of the total weight of structured coffee composition. Additional Additives The coated coffee particles may include on or more additional ingredients. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the structured coffee composition (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context). Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included and, surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee products. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290; 6,277,428; 6,090,431; 1,951,357, and EP 813816, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. While binders included in certain embodiments, in other embodiments the structured coffee composition is free of non-coffee binders. In one or more embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added during the step of mixing the one or more ground roast coffee and the solution of one or more coffee extracts. In other embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added to the structured coffee composition (e.g., after the step of drying). Flavorants, both liquid and solid (or dry), can be included in the structured coffee products in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Crème Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. The flavorants that can be used include those known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavorants. A solid sweetener such as white granulated sugar may be used in connection with the structured coffee product. Examples of a whitening agent that can be used in connection with the structured coffee products include liquid dairy components and dry dairy components. Other suitable sweeteners that can be used in connection with the structured coffee compositions are those well known in the art, including both natural and artificial sweeteners, including but not limited to also high intensity sweeteners. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,706,785; 10,182,583; and 10,278,407, which disclose flavorants, sweeteners, and whitening agents for inclusion into the structured coffee products. These patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, where the coated coffee particle is in a structured coffee composition, the structured coffee composition may be made with one or more layers of additives, for example, coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers on a side of the structured coffee composition (e.g., the top, bottom, or any side or rounded face of the structured coffee composition). In these or other embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers that bisect or are situated between two portions of the coffee composition in the structured coffee composition. In other various embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be made with one or more various elements including the coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc., wherein the structured coffee composition is a homogenous mixture of any one or more of the foregoing included therein. Method of Making a Coated Coffee Particle: As indicated above, the coated coffee particles may be prepared by mixing a solution of brewed coffee extracts with ground coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. In one or more embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts may be prepared from instant coffee. In these or other embodiments, the instant coffee may be mixed with a solvent to prepare the solution of brewed coffee extracts. Suitable solvents for used in preparing the solution of brewed coffee extracts include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, brewed extracts from coffee, tea, juice, carbonated water, nitrogen infused water, and liquid CO 2 , among others. Any suitable method of mixing the instant coffee and the solvent may be used. Generally, the instant coffee and the solvent are mixed until smooth and uniform consistency is achieved. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using an instant coffee may be a slurry. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent may be from about 4:1 to about 1:2, in other embodiments from about 3:1 to about 1:1.75, in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 1:1.5, in other embodiments from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.25, in other embodiments from about 1.15:1 to about 1:15.1, in other embodiments from about 1.1:1 to about 1:1.1, and in other embodiments from about 1.05:1 to about 1:1.05. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of brewed coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, liquid coffee concentrate may be used as or to prepare the solution of coffee extract(s). In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee extract may be used as prepared (i.e. the product of an extraction and an optional concentration). In other embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be diluted with a solvent. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extracts prepared using a liquid coffee concentrate may be a slurry. Regardless, in one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may include a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. For example, a solution of coffee extracts may be prepped by combining a solution prepared by combining instant coffee and a solvent with a liquid coffee concentrate. In other embodiments, the instant coffee may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate to prepare a solution of coffee extracts. The ranges and amount of coffee solids provided above for the liquid coffee concentrate may be used in a solution of coffee extracts that includes a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. The solution of coffee extracts may then be combined with a ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Any suitable method of mixing the solution of coffee extracts and the ground roast coffee may be used. Suitable mixing device include, but are not limited to stand mixers, spatulas, and paddle mixers. In certain embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may be sprayed on the ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Typically, prior to drying the granulated composition may be described as sticky. In one or more embodiments, the amount of solution of coffee extracts and the amount of ground roast coffee in the granulated composition may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the weight of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract(s) to the weight of the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the ratio of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts to the ground roast coffee may be from about 10:90 to about 40:60, in other embodiments from about 12.5:87.5 to about 37.5:62.5, in other embodiments from about 15:85 to about 35:65, in other embodiments from about 17.5:82.5 to about 32.5:67.5, and in other embodiments from about 20:80 to about 30:70. After the granulated composition it may be formed or otherwise shaped into a structure. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into an agglomerate with a random shape. In other embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed or molded into geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure using a press or a die. Suitable presses include a Carver Press, for example Model #3912. In these or other embodiments, a low amount of pressure or compaction should be employed in the forming of the structure so the resultant structured coffee composition is not completely compressed and includes a level of porosity. For example, a de minimis amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a pressure that slightly exceeds 0 pounds per square inch (PSI). In other embodiments, an amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a compaction of the granulated composition of between 60% and 70%. For example, a portion of the granulation composition may be molded using a target compaction travel on a carver press of 94% which is calculated by taking the amount in millimeters of the 100 percent travel of the die assembly and multiplying by 0.94 to determine the amount of travel in millimeters to achieve a 94% compaction travel target using hand compaction until the target travel is achieved thereby resulting in a compaction of 60 percent to 70 percent of the granulated coffee. After the granulated composition is formed into a structure, it may be dried to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water or other solvents may be removed by air drying, microwave drying, infrared drying, etc. After the drying step a residual amount of water, moisture, or a combination thereof may remain in the coated coffee particles. The solvent content (i.e. water, other solvents, or a combination of water and other solvents) of the of the coated coffee particles may be determined by oven drying coupled with weight analysis to provide the most universal method across solvents, allowing one to measure percent loss of the solvent or Karl Fischer Titration. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a final solvent content of less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 9.75 weight percent, less than about 9.5 weight percent, less than about 9.25 weight percent, less than about 9 weight percent, less than about 8.75 weight percent, less than about 8.5 weight percent, less than about 8.25 weight percent, less than about 8 weight percent, less than about 7.75 weight percent, less than about 7.5 weight percent, less than about 7.25 weight percent, less than about 7 weight percent, less than about 6.75 weight percent, less than about 6.5 weight percent, less than about 6.25 weight percent, less than about 6 weight percent, less than about 5.75 weight percent, less than about 5.5 weight percent, less than about 5.25 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 4.75 weight percent, less than about 4.5 weight percent, less than about 4.25 weight percent, less than about 4 weight percent, less than about 3.75 weight percent, less than about 3.5 weight percent, less than about 3.25 weight percent, less than about 3 weight percent, less than about 2.75 weight percent, less than about 2.5 weight percent, less than about 2.25 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1.75 weight percent, less than about 1.5 weight percent, less than about 1.25 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the coffee composition and/or structure present. In one or more embodiments, the water content of the structured coffee composition may be described in reference to the water content of the ingredients used to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the ground roast coffee employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. In still other embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the combination of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee (i.e. the percent of water in the combined amount of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee) employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. For example, if a structured coffee composition is prepared with a ground roast coffee and an instant coffee that both have an initial water content of 3%, the structured coffee composition may have a water content with 15% of 3% (i.e., 2.55% to 3.45%). Coating Characteristics As indicated above, the coated coffee particles include a coating that compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extract(s) and extract(s) from the ground roast coffee.

In these or other embodiments, the coated coffee particles may include a coating with a mean thickness of at most about 325 microns, at most about 350 microns, at most about 375 microns, at most about 400 microns, at most about 425 microns, at most about 450 microns, at most about 500 microns, at most about 525 microns, at most about 550 microns, at most about 575 microns, at most about 600 microns, at most about 625 microns, at most about 650 microns, at most about 675 microns, at most about 700 microns, at most about 725 microns, at most about 750 microns, at most about 775 microns, at most about 800 microns, at most about 825 microns, at most about 850 microns, at most about 875 microns, at most about 900 microns, at most about 925 microns, at most about 950 microns, at most about 975 microns, at most about 1000 microns, at most about 1025 microns, at most about 1050 microns, at most about 1075 microns, at most about 1100 microns, at most about 1125 microns, at most about 1150 microns, at most about 1175 microns, at most about 1200 microns, at most about 1225 microns, at most about 1250 microns, at most about 1275 microns, at most about 1300 microns, at most about 1325 microns, at most about 1350 microns, at most about 1375 microns, at most about 1400 microns, at most about 1425 microns, at most about 1450 microns, at most about 1475 microns, or even about 1500. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may include a coating with a mean thickness of about 5 microns to about 1500 microns, in other embodiments about 10 microns to about 1450 microns, in other embodiments about 20 microns to about 1400 microns, in other embodiments about 30 microns to about 1350 microns, in other embodiments about 40 microns to about 1300 microns, in other embodiments about 50 microns to about 1250 microns, in other embodiments about 60 microns to about 1200 microns, in other embodiments about 70 microns to about 1150 microns, in other embodiments about 80 microns to about 1100 microns, in other embodiments about 90 microns to about 1050 microns, in other embodiments about 100 microns to about 1000 microns, in other embodiments about 110 microns to about 950 microns, in other embodiments about 120 microns to about 900 microns, in other embodiments about 130 microns to about 850 microns, in other embodiments about 140 microns to about 800 microns, in other embodiments about 150 microns to about 750 microns, in other embodiments about 160 microns to about 700 microns, in other embodiments about 175 microns to about 600 microns, in other embodiments about 200 microns to about 550 microns, in other embodiments about 225 microns to about 500 microns, in other embodiments about 250 microns to about 450 microns, in other embodiments about 275 microns to about 400 microns, in other embodiments about 290 microns to about 350 microns, and in other embodiments about 300 microns to about 325 microns. In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the amount of the surface of the coffee particle that is coated by the coating that includes a mixture of the brewed coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the average surface area coverage of the coffee particle is in the range of about 50 percent to 100 percent, about 52.5 percent to 97.5 percent, or from about 55 percent to about 95 percent, or from about 57.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, or from about 60 percent to about 90 percent, or from about 62.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, or from about 65 percent to about 85 percent, or from about 67.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, or from about 70 percent to about 80 percent, or from about 72.5 percent to about 77.5 percent, or even about 75 percent of the exposed surface area of the coffee particle. Composition Size and Configuration: As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be used in structured coffee composition. Although the structured coffee compositions may be made in any size and/or three-dimensional geometric shape, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produce a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, an structured coffee may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and can optionally be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to break any coffee structure made from the one or more coffee compositions into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e., break a molded product/pellet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as one-half of a standard serving, or one-third of standard serving, or one-quarter of standard serving. The end user/consumer may add or reduce the number of coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference, to achieve brewed coffee that is weaker or stronger than normal. Since, in one embodiment, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; and 9,474,290, which disclose methods of adjusting the weakness or strength of a standard brewed coffee, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. Furthermore, about one (1) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about one (1) cup of coffee; or about three (3) standard servings of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or about four (4) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or even about five (5) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of dimensions, the process and ingredients the structured coffee composition may have a cylindrical structure measuring about 29 mm to about 33 mm in diameter and about 19.5 mm to about 32 mm in thickness and about 14.0 cm3 to about 27.0 cm3 in volume, which can have variations thereabout as further described below and shown in FIG. 2 , and Tables 2, 3, and 4. The diameter and thickness can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 6.5 grams, about 7.5 grams, about 8.5 grams, about 10.5 grams, or even about 12.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 13 grams, about 15 grams, about 17 grams, about 21 grams, or even about 25 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 19.5 grams, about 22.5 grams, about 25.5 grams, about 31.5 grams, or even about 37.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 26 grams, about 30 grams, about 34 grams, about 42 grams, or even about 50 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. Similarly, structured coffee compositions made with different dose sizes, e.g., a coffee product made to produce one-third of a standard serving of brewed coffee per structure or molded product, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different structure configurations for the structured coffee composition are also possible. For example, cylinder, cube, cuboid, sphere, pellet, ellipsoid, triangular pyramid, hexagonal prism, truncated triangular pyramid, truncated square pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, truncated hexagonal pyramid, cone, truncated cone, diamond, a three dimensional shape with an oval-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with heart-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with triangle-shaped face, or pillow shape are contemplated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical molded structure can, if so desired, be concave or convex. Additionally, or alternatively, the outer surface of a structure or molded product can have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be in the form of a particulate or an agglomeration of particles. See FIG. 1 for examples of structural shapes. It should also be noted that comparative examples are shown in some tables and figures herein, which can be labeled “Tablet Example”. The comparative example, “Tablet Example”, is a coffee tablet made using a multi-step compaction process as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Resistance to Staling In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles may have a resistance to staling or a reduced perception of staling. Resistance to staling may be measured through the quantification of lipid oxidation byproducts, such as hexanal, that are known to be generated during coffee staling and contribute to the perception of stale coffee particulate or products. Reduced perception of staling in roasted coffee particulate or products by the end user (consumer) once brewed, can be measured though the use of a trained sensory panel calibrated to identify stale notes, such as “papery,” in a coffee brew. Advantageously, the coated coffee particles may protect coffee flavor from one or more negative organoleptic effects, such as development of paper off-notes, of staling, especially those staling effects caused by lipid oxidation. In one embodiment, this is accomplished via the use of a coated coffee particulate or product (i.e., roasted and ground coffee or coffee structures formed from a roasted and ground coffee particulate or product that has been coated in any manner discussed herein) which may limit exposure of such a coffee particulate or product to environmental conditions that cause or result in enhanced lipid oxidation. In addition, the structured coffee compositions may minimize surface area to volume ratios for coffee particulate or products that will be exposed to oxidative forces, further minimizing lipid oxidation and staling thereof. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 4 days in a UV light box. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and assessed by expert panelists for staling. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Further experimental details are included in the example section. The staling data may be reported along with the exposed surface area (i.e., the area of the surface that is exposed to light divided by the total volume of the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.5, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 1. Stated differently, the brewed coffee is perceived as not stale. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.82, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 2. Stated differently the brewed coffee is perceived to have a very slight off note. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by aging the coffee under UV lights and testing determining the hexanal content. The coffee may be aged by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 7 days. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and the amount of hexanal may be determined. Further experimental details are included in the example section. In one or more embodiments, the amount of hexanal after a week of exposure of light in the coated coffee particles may be less than 40 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 30 ng/g, other embodiments less than 25 ng/g, and in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g. Packaging and Use: The coated coffee particles are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages and/or packaging. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be provided in a package as a plurality of coated coffee particles. In other embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be bound together as a structured coffee composition. Due to the resistance to staling of the coated coffee particles, they allow for reduction of packaging materials and lowers packaging cost. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; woven and nonwoven filter paper, a nylon mesh material, boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. Moreover, the instant coated slurry and/or liquid coffee concentrate can even be used to coat the inside of a package or packaging material for the coffee compositions and/or coffee structures thereof. The packaging for the coated coffee particles may be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the coated coffee particles are periodically used by the consumer, the unused coated coffee particles that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. If desired, in embodiments where the coated coffee particles are used in structured coffee compositions, the structured coffee compositions may be packaged in any desired number so that each packaged amount can be designed to yield any desired number of brewed coffee servings and/or strengths. For example, structured coffee compositions are in one embodiment designed to produce a single serving of coffee per coffee composition and/or structures thereof can be packaged individually to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, in groups of two to facilitate making two cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of three to facilitate making three cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle and so forth up to groups of twelve to facilitate making twelve cups of coffee in a single brew. The structured coffee compositions may be packaged with more or less of the same to produce stronger or weaker coffee for a standard brew of coffee since, in one embodiment, the coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) can be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. Furthermore, in yet other embodiments designed to produce a single serving of coffee per structured coffee composition can be packaged individually as structured coffee composition to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, or can be packaged in a group of three (3) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of about four (4) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of even about five (5) structured coffee compositions coffee to facilitate making about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. One advantage is that two or more structured coffee compositions may be, via two different coffee compositions or structures formed from each respective different structured coffee composition, combined in the same brew to produce a preferred brew in which the one or more properties resulting from the combination of different coffee compositions or structures provide a desired variation, change or combination in flavor, strength, caffeine content, or other such characteristic in the preferred brew. A wide variety of types of structured coffee compositions can be provided together in a pre-packaged kit, or in a consumer selected array, to facilitate preparation of a preferred brew specific to an individual consumer's preferences. As such, an exemplary kit may include a plurality of varied structured coffee compositions, with at least two of the varied structured coffee compositions having a different predetermined property, such as, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, level of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee, or type, of coffee bean treatment. Such a kit can be provided with instructions for combining the two or more types of coffee composition to prepare a desired brewed coffee. These instructions may include one or more “recipes” for preparing one or more special predetermined blends of coffee. The present invention may be packaged as coffee compositions (if in loose powdered form) and/or as an appropriate number of structured coffee compositions. See various methods of packaging and use of coffee compositions and products as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition Properties: In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with brewing water of a desired and/or suitable temperature (any temperature could be used, for example in the range of 1° C. to 100° C., as both hot and cold coffee brews are desirable) at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated herein. The strength/robustness of the structured coffee compositions may conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a product's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the structure in an axial direction over the height of the structure or across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure. Product hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the structure is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the structure breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the structure to break is taken as the hardness of the structure, which is sometimes referred to as the “structure crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. As shown in Table 2 below and FIGS. 3 A and 3 B, the structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the height or axial direction of the structure in the range of about 21.3 N (Newtons) to about 61.7 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 20 N to about 65 N, about 22.5 N to about 62.5 N, about 25 N to about 60 N, about 27.5 N to about 57.5 N, about 30 N to about 55 N, about 32.5 N to about 52.5 N, about 35 N to about 50 N, about 37.5 N to about 47.5 N, about 40 N to about 45 N or even about 42.5 N. The structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure in the range of about 11.1 N (Newtons) to about 51.6 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 10 N to about 52.5 N, about 12.5 N to about 50 N, about 15 N to about 45 N, about 17.5 N to about 42.5 N, about 20 N to about 40 N, about 20 N to about 37.5 N, about 22.5 N to about 35 N, about 25 N to about 32.5 N, or even about 30 N.

For convenience, the friability of the structured coffee compositions can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating the structure in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these structures that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The structures should not be broken to obtain the weight of the structure in grams, but adjust the number of whole structures to come as close as possible to weight of the structure in grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of structures represents the friability of these structures. As shown in Table 3 below and in FIG. 4 , it has been found that the structured coffee compositions, can have a friability in the range of about 50 to 55 percent to about 100 percent (total disintegration of the coffee structure), of about 57.5 percent to about 97.5 percent, of about 60 percent to about 95 percent, of about 62.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, of about 65 percent to about 90 percent, of about 67.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, of about 70 percent to about 85 percent, of about 72.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, of about 75 percent to about 80 percent, or even about 77.5 percent.

Water activity may be determined using a water activity meter such as a Rotronic Hygrolab Water Activity Meter. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. Furthermore, generally speaking, and as shown in Table 4 (water activity data) above, structured coffee compositions having the above combination of properties of about stated values and/or within claimed ranges for hardness, friability, and density within the diameter and height measurements and the about stated target weights may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. It has been further found that the coated coffee particles achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise conventional ground roast coffee composition. That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the coated coffee particles are used in a typical ADC coffee maker or other brewing devices than when the same amount of conventional ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. Yield ratios provided by the structured coffee compositions, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the structured coffee compositions relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of conventional ground roast coffee (e.g., the ground roast coffee used to prepare the structured coffee composition) is normally greater than about 1 and in many instances greater than about 1.1, greater than about 1.2, greater than about 1.25, greater than about 1.5, greater than about 1.75, greater than about 2, greater than about 2.25, greater, than about 2.5, greater than about 2.75, and even about 3 on a weight basis. As discussed herein, various particle sizes for the roast and ground coffee may be used, which may result in various percent brew solids, density, and percent porosity in the molded product. Porosity is measured by Micro-CT (also called microtomography or micro-computed tomography). In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity (i.e., percent of total volume) in the structured coffee compositions may greater than 40%, greater than 42.5%, greater than 45% or greater than 47.5%, or greater than 50%, or greater than 52.5%, or greater than 55%, or greater than 57.5%, or greater than 60%. In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity in the structured coffee compositions may range between from about 40% to about 80%, or from about 42.5% to about 77.5%, or from about 45% to about 75%, or from about 47.5% to about 72.5%, or from about 50% to about 70%, or from about 52.5% to about 67.5%, or from about 55% to about 65%, or from about 57.5% to about 62.5%, or even about 60%. In light of the above, when a standard serving of coffee is prepared the percent brew solids achieved by the structed coffee compositions are in the range of about 0.90 weight percent to about 3.00 weight percent, or from about 0.95 weight percent to about 2.95 weight percent, about 1.00 weight percent to about 2.9 weight percent, or from about 1.05 weight percent to about 2.85 weight percent, or from about 1.10 weight percent to about 2.80 weight percent, about 1.15 weight percent to about 2.75 weight percent, or from about 1.20 weight percent to about 2.70 weight percent, about 1.25 weight percent to about 2.65 weight percent, about 1.30 weight percent to about 2.60 weight percent, about 1.35 weight percent to about 2.55 weight percent, about 1.40 weight percent to about 2.50 weight percent, about 1.45 weight percent to about 2.45 weight percent, about 1.50 weight percent to about 2.40 weight percent, about 1.55 weight percent to about 2.35 weight percent, about 1.60 weight percent to about 2.30 weight percent, about 1.65 weight percent to about 2.25 weight percent, about 1.70 weight percent to about 2.20 weight percent, about 1.75 weight percent to about 2.15 weight percent, about 1.80 weight percent to about 2.10 weight percent, about 1.85 weight percent to about 2.05 weight percent, about 1.90 weight percent to about 2.00 weight percent, or even about 1.95 weight percent, based on the weight of the coffee brewed. For measurement of the percent (%) brew solids (% BS) used herein, the refractive index (RI) is measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. Then a linear regression equation is developed and used to correlate the RI to % BS. The coated coffee particles and structured coffee compositions prepared from the coated coffee particles coated coffee particles disassociate and brews rapidly in both room temperature and cold water applications when used for cold brew coffee, which is shown in Table 5. The present invention disassociates in hot water (196.5-202° F.) in about 15 to about 21 seconds, in room temperature water (72-72.3° F.) in about 1 minute 7 seconds to about 1 minute 24 seconds, and in cold water (38.7-42.3° F.) in about 2 minutes 51 seconds to about 4 minutes 12 seconds. While the coated coffee particles may be brewed by any conventional means, the coated coffee particles, when used for quick cold brew coffee provides a bold cold brew coffee strength to remain bold when served over ice. It uses less coffee and brews in a shorter time frame than conventional cold brew formulations to provide a consistent brew.

The follow list of coffee products are used to produce the various coffee brews tested by the panelists: (a) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at standard drop weight (30.5 grams) (FOL 30.5 grams); (b) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at drop weight matching the present invention composition drop weight (34.0 grams) (FOL 34 grams); (c) Present Invention (4×8.5 gram structures)−80 percent Folgers Classic Roast and Ground+20 percent Colcafe Instant (Invention); (d) Folgers Instant Crystals (14.2 grams) (Fol Inst); and (e) Colcafe Instant (14.2 grams)−Low Yield High Quality Instant (Colcafe). All products are brewed in Mr. Coffee ADC brewers in 1420 mL H2O at a temperature of about 157° F. +/−1° F. The panels are run blind and randomized. These products are evaluated and compared over a number of different coffee flavor attributes. It is determined that the coated coffee particles produce a brewed coffee that has the most coffee “Body,” such as heaviness, mouthfeel, consistency, and/or weight as it coated the tongue of the panelists. Further, Body, is the feeling of the consistency of the liquid related to the amount of extraction of the solids or any other additives that increase the viscosity (References: heaviness on tongue, fullness of mouthfeel). As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 , the coated coffee particle closely tracks the attributes of a conventional roast and ground coffee (both Folgers Classic roast and ground coffees) even with a mixture of instant coffee therein with the roast and ground. Working Examples: Proof of UV Treatment as an Accelerant to Induce Staling: A validation experiment is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of UV treatment to accelerate staling. This experiment evaluates the degree of difference (DOD) of brewed coffee flavor from a sealed control. The treatments include coffee placed on a foil lined tray subjected to UV aging, coffee placed on a foil lined tray and left in the dark, coffee left enclosed in its original canister after opening, and coffee left sealed in its original canister without opening. At the beginning of the experiment, ten cans of Folgers Classic Roast coffee are procured from a local grocery store (Buehler's, Orrville, OH). All cans are within their use by dates at time of evaluation. All cans are subjected to oxygen measurement before opening to ensure fresh coffee. Four randomly selected cans are opened and 29.5 gram lots of roast and ground coffee from each can are placed in a thin layer on two foil lined service trays (number of tray samples=8 trays total). Four of these trays are placed under UV lights, four are placed in dark in laboratory drawers. After coffee samples are distributed, the cans from which they came are then closed with their manufacture supplied lids and placed in a dark drawer at room temperature for storage. Finally, one tray of 29.5 grams of instant coffee (Folger's) is placed under UV light as well. Coffee samples are evaluated against a sealed reference at one, four and eleven days of storage. On the final day, the instant coffee is included in the evaluation. Degree of difference is scored internally by expert cuppers on the following scale: 0.2 no difference; 0.3 very slight difference; 0.5 slight difference; 0.8 moderate difference; and 1.2 large difference. Results: It is found that coffee stored under UV light is noticeably stale after one day of aging and is moderately to very different in flavor from a sealed control by day four. By day eleven, coffee stored under UV light and in the dark on trays are both moderately to very different from sealed controls and classified as stale (See Table 6 below). These results indicate that UV light treatment does accelerate the aging process. It also highlights that the sensory qualities produced by UV staling are the same as encountered in coffee samples that stale in the dark, supporting the theory that both UV exposed and non-UV exposed samples are undergoing similar aging reactions, but at different rates. Table 6 below discloses average degree of difference (DOD) scores for coffee stored under different conditions and illustrates that UV light rapidly accelerated the aging process.

The experiment examines four product forms all using an 80:20 weight percent mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee: (a) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee dry mix; (b) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed herein using water in the form of a three-dimensional coffee structure; (c) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed above using water in the form of a loose unformed particulate; and (d) flaked roast and ground coffee with instant in a dry mix. Evaluations are carried out using two different instant coffees, a high yield regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration and a high quality Colombian instant coffee from Coleafé. The experiment is set up as a randomized block design with five blocks containing three replicates of each of the four coffee forms disclosed above. At the start of the experiment, the first block is subjected to in initial evaluation before aging (Time (T)=0 days). After the initial assessment, the remaining blocks are placed under UV lights. Additional samples are evaluated at one, four and seven days. On sampling days, a block is chosen at random for evaluation. Coffee from the selected block is brewed (34 grams coffee to 1420 grams water) on an ADC brewer and subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using a trained sensory panel (no. of evaluators=9 to 11 evaluators per tasting). Panelists assign each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Before submitting coffee samples for sensory analysis, two 5.0 mL aliquots of each brew are collected for monitoring of chemical markers for lipid oxidation, including hexanal. Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Finally, samples from each treatment in each block are saved for imaging using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Results: It is found that there is a significant reduction in both staling flavor and the chemical marker for staling (hexanal) in the formed coffee structures of item (b) above versus all other treatments for both instant types (see FIGS. 9 A and 9 B). There is no difference between the un-formed three-dimensional coffee structures (item (c) above) and the roast and ground/instant mix control (Item (d) above). It is further determined that the exposed surface of the three-dimensional coffee structure of item (b) above has a significantly higher level of hexanal per gram dry coffee than the core of the structure (see FIG. 10 ). This suggests a surface area effect for protecting the coffee from staling. It is found that a coating of instant coffee is formed on individual roast and ground coffee particles during the methods of the present invention using water as described herein. However, it is also found that the coating of the roast and ground coffee particles is uneven, leaving some areas with no instant coffee coating (see FIGS. 11 A, 11 B and 11 C). Specifically, FIG. 9 A illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above are scored significantly lower compared to all other forms of coffee (items (a), (c) and (d)) for papery notes, a measure of coffee staling, for both instant coffee types. FIG. 9 B illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above have significantly lower hexanal concentrations as compared to all other treatments (items (a), (c) and (d)) starting at day three of the experiment for both instant coffees evaluated. FIG. 10 illustrates that the surface of the three-dimensional coffee structures have a significantly higher concentration of hexanal than the core of the coffee structures as evidenced by higher hexanal/deuterated hexanal ratio for the surface of the coffee structures (see item (b) above). This difference is identified in the coffee structures of item (b) using both instant coffee types. FIGS. 11 A, 11 B and 11 C are electron micrographs of un-treated roast and ground coffee particles where FIG. 11 A depicts void spaces with sharp edges resulting from the remnants of cell walls of the coffee seed; FIG. 11 B depicts that some portions of the un-coated coffee particulate particles are similarly un-coated; and FIG. 11 C depicts that other portions exhibit an instant coffee coating. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: To test the barrier effects of an instant coffee coating apart from the effect of product form, this experiment places roast and ground coffee into metal tins that are then subjected to accelerated aging using UV light. The tins protect the coffee from light except at the exposed surface. The tins are then assigned to one of four treatments: (i) uncovered with full exposure to UV light; (ii) covered with a metal tin lid; (iii) partially covered with instant coffee coating; and (iv) fully covered with an instant coffee coating. The tins are exposed to UV light for five days and then subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation by expert cuppers and evaluated for stale flavors. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Results: After five (5) days of aging, it is found that coffee covered with a full coating of instant coffee is not significantly different from coffee covered with a tin lid, thus showing no staling effect for both treatments. Coffee exposed to UV light, or with a partial coating, tastes stale. Matching the sensory results, the level of hexanal in the uncovered samples is significantly higher than in the control or fully coated samples, indicating that the fully coated samples are protected from staling. As shown in FIG. 12 , the hexanal to deuterated hexanal ratio of samples covered with a tin lid (control) or covered with a full coating of instant coffee (covered) are significantly lower than uncovered samples, indicating that less staling had occurred. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: This experiment is designed to test if thin layers of instant coffee could prevent staling of roast and ground coffee. In this experiment, thin layers if instant coffee (covering two ranges of thickness, averaging 45 μm and 258 μm, respectively) are created on a scaffolding of nylon mesh. Layers are created by applying hydrated instant coffee (1:1 w/w with water) to the mesh with a brush. The scaffold is then allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight. The resulting layers of instant coffee are then fixed over trays of roast and ground coffee. Trays are then subjected accelerated aging using UV light. Staling is assessed through sensory evaluation and measurement of chemical staling markers. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using expert cuppers. Cuppers assigned each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. The instant coffee films are visualized and their thickness measured using ESEM (150× magnification). Thin films averaged 48 μm in thickness (minimum 23 μm), while the thicker films averaged 258 μm in thickness. A nylon mesh is used as a scaffolding to form thin layers of instant coffee. To test the effectiveness of these layers in preventing staling, the mesh scaffolds with and without instant coffee are placed over trays of roast and ground coffee during accelerated aging using UV light. Results: It is found that the instant coffee films (both thicknesses) are able to reduce staling in the roast and ground coffee as assessed though sensory evaluation and measurement of the chemical staling marker hexanal (see FIGS. 13 A and 13 B, respectively). This experiment demonstrates that a thin film of instant coffee is able to confer a protective effect against staling for roast and ground coffee. As illustrated in FIG. 13 A, papery flavor scores for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. As illustrated in FIG. 13 B, the area ratios between hexanal and deuterated hexanal for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. Creating Roast and Ground Particles with Instant Coating: This set of experiments evaluates several different methods of combining at least one roast and ground coffee with a hydrated slurry formed from water and at least one instant coffee (or equivalent) for their ability to form an instant coffee coating on the at least one type of roast and ground coffee (see Table 7 for the various particulars). Coating completeness is evaluated by electron microscopy. The method of forming the coated products of Treatments 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 is discussed in detail below. Each form represents a different means of application that is effective in producing a coating with a coverage within the scope of the present invention as discussed above. As shown in Table 7, different treatments are tested to see if a coating of instant coffee within the scope of the present invention as detailed herein could be applied to roast and ground coffee particles.

Treatment 2—Roast and Ground Coffee with Liquid Coffee Concentrate, small agglomerates: Step (1): Place liquid coffee concentrate (20.0 g liquid coffee concentrate for 100 grams of mix) in a clean stand mixer bowl. Agitate the coffee concentrate at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment (about 0.5 minutes) Step (2): Once the liquid coffee concentrate has begun to coat the mixing bowl, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the liquid coffee concentrate at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts liquid coffee concentrate (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams liquid coffee concentrate). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the liquid coffee concentrate suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and liquid coffee concentrate are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #8 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen. The resulting matrix is then transferred to a drying surface (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). Step (5): The resulting matrix is allowed to dry over night or until excess moisture is removed. Treatment 4—Particulate Air Dried: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) of at least one type of instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until fully mixed (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allowed dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 6—Particulate #16 Sieve: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #16 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen in order to create small agglomerates/particles over a catch tray that can be used for drying (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). The screening process creates small agglomerates that dry easily at room temperature. Step (5): The resulting mixture is allowed to dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 8—Particulate: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 60 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 60.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 10—Microgrind: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (50.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (50.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula with gentle agitation. Allow the resulting coffee-water mixture to settle for about 30 minutes. Remove any foam from the top of the instant coffee suspension and retain the de-foamed suspension. Step (2): Combine the de-foamed instant coffee suspension with microgrind roast and ground coffee in a stand mixer bowl at a ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts dry instant coffee equivalent (80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 40.0 grams of instant coffee suspension from Step (1)). Mix microgrind roast and ground coffee and instant coffee suspension using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (3): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Results: The above experiments found that by varying one of several variables, a desired shell formed from one or more types of liquid coffee concentrate or instant coffee, with any desired coverage percentage as disclosed above, could be achieved around individual roast and ground coffee particles (see FIGS. 14 A through 14 E) as evidenced by comparison to uncoated regions of a un-formed coffee particulate coffee ground (see FIG. 15 ). Variables within the scope of the present invention include, but are not limited to, increasing the amount of water in the water/instant coffee mixture, varying the roast and ground particle size, increasing the amount of instant coffee slurry to roast and ground coffee to form the instant coffee/roast and ground mixture, and/or altering the post-mix handling process. More Anti-Staling Working Examples: Multiple experiments to test anti-staling properties of coffee extract coatings are setup and run to analyze the impact of the following: (i) surface area to volume ratio; (ii) instant coffee mass to water ratio; and (iii) use of liquid coffee extract as a coating substance. Accelerated aging using UV light box is utilized for three to four days of aging. Staling of the coffee samples is assessed by expert panelists through independent assessments. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Impact of Surface Area to Volume Ratio on Staling of Coffee: Two sample types of coffee are prepared to assess the impact of surface area to volume ratio on coffee samples which include (1) loose roast and ground coffee on a tray; and (2) three-dimensional coffee structures prepared from the any one of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein. For item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee the percent of surface area exposed to UV light is controlled with aluminum foil (Al) or sheets of instant coffee film (IF) laid over the roast and ground coffee. The coffee on an uncovered tray has one (top) surface exposed to UV (50 percent of surface area) and one (bottom) surface against the tray bottom (50 percent of surface area). For item (2) the three-dimensional coffee structure (cylindrical shaped) only the top surface of the structure is directly exposed to UV light. Decreasing the mass of the structure changes its height, but does not change its diameter. Further, decreasing the mass of the structure increases the surface area exposed to UV light for a given mass of structures (approximately 34 grams). Both coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: Item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee on a tray started to stale between 75 percent and 85 percent coverage. The instant coffee film (IF) covered coffee samples performed as well as the aluminum foil (Al) covered coffee samples. The three dimensional structures of the present invention discussed herein started to stale between tablets weights of about four gram to two gram target weights. As seen in Table 8, staling of coffee samples discussed above is not detected at a surface to area volume ratio at or below 0.82. Staling is detected at a surface area to volume ratio at or above 1.39. Exposed surface area to volume ratios for preventing staling of any of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein are at least about 0, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.05, at least about 0.07, at least about 0.10, at least about 0.12, at least about 0.15, at least about 0.17, at least about 0.20, at least about 0.22, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.27, at least about 0.30, at least about 0.32, at least about 0.35, at least about 0.37, at least about 0.40, at least about 0.43 at least about 0.45, at least about 0.48, at least about 0.50, at least about 0.53, at least about 0.55, at least about 0.57, at least about 0.60, at least about 0.62, at least about 0.65, at least about 0.67, at least about 0.70, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.75, at least about 0.77, at least about 0.80, at least about 0.82, at least about 0.84, at least about 0.86, at least about 0.88, at least about 0.90, at least about 0.92, at least about 0.94, at least about 0.96, at least about 0.98, or even at least about 1. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. TABLE 8 Exposed Surface Area Stale Score Treatment to Volume Ratio (1-5) Tray Al 100% covered R & G coffee 0.00 1 Tray Al 97.5% covered R & G coffee 0.32 1 8.5 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 0.42-0.43 1 6.5 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 0.48-0.50 1 Tray Al 95% covered R & G coffee 0.53 2 Tray IF 95% covered R & G coffee 0.53 2 4.0 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 0.77-0.82 2 2.0 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 1.39-1.45 3 Tray Al 85% covered R & G coffee 1.58 3 Tray Al 75% covered R & G coffee 2.63 4 Tray uncovered (50% total exposure) R & G coffee 5.26 5 Impact of Instant Coffee Dilution on Staling: Instant coffee is diluted in water at three ratios are analyzed including: (i) 1:1 instant coffee to water; (ii) 1:2 instant coffee to water; and (iii) 1:4 instant coffee to water ratios to understand the target weight percent of instant coffee. The instant coffee dilutions of items (i) through (iii) above are tested on micro grind roast and ground coffee (particle size of about 200 microns or less) and ADC brewer grind size roast and ground coffee (average particle size of about 1000 microns). All treatments of items (i) through (iii) are applied using various methods as discussed herein of the present invention at an 80:20 mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee to make coffee compositions of the present invention as discussed herein. The coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the microgrind coffee samples with a more diluted suspension of instant coffee (1:4) to water is more effective at protecting the microgrind coffee from staling than more concentrated suspensions (1:1 or 1:2), which is likely due to increased coating with less dense extract suspension on this grind size. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of three (3) (slightly stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of one (1) (not stale) For ADC brewer grind size, the larger grind size, a more concentrated suspension of instant coffee in water is more effective at protecting the coffee from staling. The larger grind size may absorb the suspension differently than smaller particles. Grind size is critical to determine the target instant coffee dilution (weight percent) for forming the coating. It is determined that different dilutions needed at different grind sizes. For the microgrind a 1:4 dilution is targeted and for the ADC brewer grind size, a 1:1-1:2 dilution is targeted. For the ADC brewer grind size, the negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). Impact of Roast and Ground Coffee to Coffee Extract Ratio on Staling: Three ratios of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract are analyzed including: (i) 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; (ii) 70:30 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; and (iii) 60:40 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract (all at a weight to weight). Two roast and ground grind sizes of coffee are analyzed for the coating of instant coffee thereof including microgrind and ADC brewer grind size. Liquid coffee concentrate is used to coat the roast and ground coffee. All roast and ground coffee samples are in particulate form. The coated coffee samples are aged under UV light for three days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the liquid coffee concentrate coating on microgrind coffee, an increased amount of liquid coffee (60:40 ratio) in the formulation helps prevent staling versus less mass of liquid coffee (80:20 or 70:30 ratios). The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is more effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 60:40 ratio received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of three point five (3.5) (slightly stale to stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). For liquid coffee concentrate coating on ADC brewer grind size, an increased amount of liquid coffee (70:30 ratio) staled while application of liquid coffee 20 percent by weight did not. The 60:40 application is too liquid to form particulates and is untestable. The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is less effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of the five (5) (very stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of one (1) (not stale). Summary of Anti-Staling Working Examples: The total solids concentration and liquid volume impact the instant coating effectiveness of protecting the roast and ground coffee from staling. Target application of the instant coating on microgrind coffee is an instant coffee dilution of 1:4 instant coffee to water and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for microgrind coffee is a target applied at 60:40 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight). Target application for ADC brewer grind size coffee for instant coffee dilution is about a 1:1 to about a 1:2 instant coffee to water ratio and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for ADC brewer grind size coffee is target applied at 80:20 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight).

TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to the field of coffee preparation, and more specifically to a new and useful method for brewing coffee in the field of coffee preparation. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 1 is a flowchart representation of a method of one embodiment; FIG. 2 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method; FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of a coffee brewing machine of one embodiment of the invention; FIG. 4 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method; FIG. 5 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method; FIGS. 6A and 6B are graphical representations of one variation of the method; and FIG. 7 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method. DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS The following description of the embodiment of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention. 1. First Method and Applications As shown in FIG. 1, a method for brewing coffee at a coffee brewing machine includes: identifying a coffee bean from data derived from a canister containing the coffee bean in Block S 110 ; retrieving a recipe for the coffee bean in Block S 120 , the recipe specified by a coffee roaster supplying the coffee bean; identifying a grind profile of the coffee bean in Block S 130 ; setting brewing parameters at the coffee brewing machine based on the recipe and the grind profile of the coffee bean in Block S 140 , the brewing parameters including a brew temperature and a steep time; and controlling the coffee brewing machine according to the brewing parameters to brew the cup of coffee from the coffee bean in Block S 150 . As shown in FIG. 7, one variation of first method S 100 for brewing a cup of coffee at a coffee brewing machine includes: receiving a coffee source identifier in Block S 110 ; retrieving a recipe for brewing a coffee bean based on the coffee source identifier in Block S 120 ; initiating a brew cycle in Block S 142 ; heating water in a boiler to a target temperature specified by the recipe in Block S 152 ; metering a volume of water from the boiler into a brew chamber in Block S 154 ; heating the brew chamber to maintain the volume of water near the target temperature in Block S 160 ; according to the recipe, displaying an agitation instruction at a first time during the brew cycle in Block—S 170 ; according to the recipe, triggering a first alarm to cease agitation at a second time during the brew cycle in Block S 172 ; and according to the recipe, triggering a second alarm to dispense fluid from the brew chamber at a third time during the brew cycle in Block S 180 . First method S 100 functions to set and control brewing parameters for a coffee bean based on a predetermined coffee recipe to enable accurate and repeatable replication of a coffee experience, such as defined by a coffee roaster supplying the coffee bean. In particular, first method S 100 can enable a coffee roaster to refine and set a specific brewing recipe for his coffee bean, such as on a bean type basis, on a roast batch number basis, or even on a per-pound of coffee basis, thereby providing the coffee roaster with controls to predetermine and remotely (and asynchronously) oversee the flavor of every cup of coffee brewed with his coffee beans, whether in a local coffee shop, in a remote café, or in a private residence. First method S 100 can enable this functionality by identifying a particular whole or ground coffee bean selected for an upcoming brew cycle, such as based on an identifier applied to packaging containing the bean or based on a selection for the coffee bean entered manually into the coffee brewing machine. First method S 100 then retrieves a brew recipe specific to the identified coffee bean, such as from local memory or from a remote database of coffee brewing recipes. Alternatively, first method S 100 can extract the recipe directly from the coffee bean packaging (e.g., a one-pound coffee bag, a coffee tin), such as by reading and translating a quick-response (QR) code, a bar code, a RFID tag, or other embedded code applied or printed onto the packaging. First method S 100 then sets brewing parameters to brew cup, pot, or other volume of coffee with the coffee bean (i.e., a brew cycle) at the coffee brewing machine. For example, first method S 100 can account for a current state of the coffee brewing machine or a local coffee grinder (e.g., hours, wear), water quality, environmental conditions, or coffee bean quality (e.g., age, moisture content), etc. to map the recipe to the coffee brewing machine for the current brew cycle. First method S 100 is described generally in the context of brewing coffee. For example, first method S 100 can control various parameters to accurately and repeatably recreate a coffee flavor experience—as defined by an affiliated coffee roaster—from freshly-ground whole coffee beans. However, first method S 100 can also be applicable to brewing tea or to brewing any other hot to cold beverage. Furthermore, first method S 100 is described generally in the context of replicating a coffee experience defined by a coffee roaster by accurately and repeatedly executing a recipe set by the roaster for the particular coffee bean. However, any other entity can create, modify, or set a recipe for brewing a coffee bean (or other steeping material), such as a café manager, a trained barista, a taste representative of a restaurant that serves its own “brew” of a common coffee, a hotel manager, a representative of a catering service, or any other representative of a food- or drink-related business or service in order to customize the recipe for the business or service. A user can also create, modify, or set the recipe and then share the recipe with other users (e.g., other cafés, other baristas), such as over a social networking system, through an online forum, or via an execution file shared via email. 2. Coffee Brewing Machine Blocks of first method S 100 can execute on a coffee brewing machine capable of automatically controlling brew time, brew temperature, brewing pressure, agitation, and water-to-coffee-ground ratio controls and/or capable of interfacing with a human user (e.g., a barista) to guide executing of the specific recipe for the coffee bean. For example, Blocks of first method S 100 can be implemented by a coffee brewing machine incorporating the brewing system described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0186456, published on 26 Jul. 2012, which is incorporated in its entirety by this reference. In another example shown in FIG. 3, the coffee brewing machine 100 includes an input module 110 for a receiving a coffee bean selection, a water reservoir 120 , a boiler 130 that heats water received from the reservoir 120 , a first temperature sensor 131 that measures water temperature in the boiler 130 , a brew chamber 140 in which water is steeped with coffee grounds, a pump 150 that dispenses heated water into the brew chamber 140 , heater that heats fluid in the brew chamber 140 during brew cycles, a second temperature sensor 141 that measures fluid temperature in the brew chamber 140 , a valve 142 in the base of the brew chamber 140 to dispense fluid out of the brew chamber 140 , a manually-operated piston 170 that forces fluid out of the brew chamber 140 through a filter between the valve 142 and the brew chamber 140 , a display 112 that presents brewing instructions to a user, an audio driver 114 that delivers audible cues to the user, and a processor 160 that controls the foregoing components of the coffee brewing machine 100 to brew the selected coffee bean automatically or with manually assistance. In this example, the input module can include an optical sensor, and the processor 160 can communicate with the optical sensor to read a QR code on the coffee packaging, interface with a wireless communication module within the coffee brewing machine 100 to retrieve a coffee brewing recipe from a remote server based on the QR code, set brewing parameters based on the retrieved brewing recipe (and other measured or determined variables at or near the coffee brewing machine 100 ), and applies the coffee brewing parameters through the foregoing components of the coffee brewing machine 100 during the brew cycle. However, the coffee brewing machine 100 can be of any other suitable form, such as a large professional coffee brewing machine for café use, an under-counter coffee brewing machine, or a small residential coffee brewing machine for a private or home use. The brewing machine can also source water from a plumbed line or tap into a commercial or residential plumbing system or from a reservoir within the brewing machine that is refilled manually. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 2, one or more Blocks of first method S 100 can be execute on a discrete computing device in communication with the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one example in which the coffee brewing machine 100 is a residential coffee brewing machine, a user can open a native application (or an application within a web browser) executing on his mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet) to scan a QR code printed on a coffee bag, and the native application can transmit data extracted from the QR code to a remote server to retrieve the coffee brewing recipe and then upload the received recipe to the user's coffee brewing machine, such as over Wi-Fi, cellular, or Bluetooth communication protocol. Alternatively, the native application can trigger the remote server to push the recipe directly to the coffee brewing machine 100 . The coffee brewing machine 100 can then execute other Blocks of first method S 100 to brew the coffee bean according to the received recipe and/or brewing parameters. In this example, the native application can also handle wired or wireless communications with the coffee brewing machine 100 to track and store a serial number, a model number, age, total hours of use, gallons of water used, actual and target temperature of the boiler 130 and the brew chamber 140 in the coffee brewing machine 100 , and/or other information pertaining to the coffee brewing machine 100 . The native application can similarly access local information, such as time, weather, humidity, temperature, and location from sensors integrated into the mobile computing device (e.g., a thermistor, a global positioning system (GPS) sensor) and/or downloaded from a local weather tower or an online weather database. The native application can thus adjust brewing parameters for the upcoming brew cycle based on machine and environmental information. However, the mobile computing device and the coffee brewing machine 100 can cooperate in any other way to execute Blocks of first method S 100 . Blocks of first method S 100 can additionally or alternatively be implemented by a remote computer system, such as a remote server in communication with the coffee brewing machine 100 or with a network of coffee brewing machines linked through an Internet or Ethernet connection. The computer system can be a cloud-based computer (e.g., Amazon EC2), a mainframe computer system, a grid-computer system, or any other suitable computer system. For example, the computer system can be a remote server that communicates with one or more coffee brewing machines over HTTP (or TCP or UDP) protocols through a web service (e.g., Amazon AWS). The computer system can thus receive recipe, roaster, coffee brewing machine, coffee grinder, environmental, and other data from and transmit parameters, recipe information, etc. to the coffee brewing machine 100 , a coffee grinder, a user's mobile computing device, etc., such as over an Internet, Ethernet, cellular, Wi-Fi, satellite, or other suitable connection. However, Blocks of first method S 100 can be implemented by any other one or more devices and in any other suitable way. 3. Coffee Bean Identifier Block S 110 of first method S 100 recites receiving a coffee source identifier. Generally, Block S 110 functions to collect data identifying the coffee bean to be brewed and to pass these data to Block S 120 , which selects a particular brew recipe corresponding to the coffee bean for an upcoming brew cycle on the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one implementation, Block S 110 automatically identifies a coffee bean from data collected from the packaging containing the coffee bean. In particular, in this implementation, Block S 110 identifies the coffee bean that is to be brewed in the upcoming brew cycle by extracting identifying information directly from the coffee bean packaging—such as from a one-pound coffee bag or from a coffee tin—containing whole coffee beans or coffee grounds. As described below, Block S 110 can cooperate with Block S 120 to extract or retrieve a recipe for the coffee directly from the packaging containing the coffee bean. Alternatively, Block S 110 can retrieve a coffee source identifier—such as a serial number or address unique to the packaging, the coffee bean roast batch, or to the roaster supplying the coffee bean—and Block S 120 can reference the coffee source identifier to a local or remote database of coffee beans to identify the specific coffee bean and to retrieve the corresponding recipe. In this implementation, Block S 110 downloads a coffee source identifier from a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, a near-field communication (NFC) tag, or any other suitable wireless transmitter arranged on the packaging. For example, the coffee brewing machine 100 can include an RFID reader, an NFC reader, or an other radio-based wireless scanner or receiver, and Block S 110 can interface with this receiver to collect the coffee source identifier from the coffee packaging, such as when a user swipes the coffee packaging over the receiver. In particular, Block S 110 can cooperate with Block S 120 to download the recipe directly from wireless transmitter arranged on the coffee bean packaging. Alternatively, Block S 110 can download a unique code (e.g., an alphanumeric sequence) from the wireless transmitter arranged on the coffee bean packaging and pass the code to a remote server that identifies and selects the corresponding recipe, and Block S 120 can then receive the recipe back from the remote server. In this implementation, Block S 110 can similarly execute on or interface with a receiver integrated into a user's mobile computing device to retrieve the coffee source identifier from the coffee bean packaging. Alternatively, in this implementation, the coffee brewing machine 100 includes an optical sensor (e.g., a camera), and Block S 110 interfaces with the optical sensor can capture an input of the coffee bean packaging and implements machine vision to identify a QR code, a bar code, a serial number, or other coffee source identifier printed on or applied to the packaging. For example, Block S 110 can implement optical character recognition to extract coffee-related information from an image of a portion of the bag on which the QR code, bar code, or serial number, etc. is arranged. In this example, Block S 110 can control the optical sensor to automatically capture the image when a user holds the coffee packaging in front of the optical sensor. Block S 110 can thus cooperate with Block S 120 and the optical sensor to read the recipe directly off of the packing. Block S 110 can alternatively read the coffee source identifier, such as a name, a roast batch number, a roaster, a roast date, and/or a serial number, directly off of the packaging, and Block S 120 can pass any one or more of these data to local memory or to a remote server to collect the corresponding recipe. Similarly, Block S 110 can identify a code arranged on the packaging in the image, such as a barcode or a QR code, and translate the identified code into coffee source identifier (e.g., an alphanumeric sequence), and Block S 120 can similarly handle the coffee source identifier to collect the recipe for the coffee bean. For example, Block S 110 can read a quick-response code applied onto the coffee bag with an optical sensor coupled to the coffee brewing machine 100 and identify a coffee roaster supplying the coffee bean and a roast date of the coffee bean from the quick-response code, and Block S 120 can download the recipe assigned to the coffee bean for the roast date by the coffee roaster. In another implementation, Block S 110 cooperates with the input module 110 to receive manual entry of a name, an identification number, a batch number, a serial number, or any other suitable coffee source identifier related to the coffee bean selected from the upcoming brew cycle. For example, the coffee brewing machine 100 can include a display 112 and a discrete input region (e.g., a switch or button), and Block S 110 can control the display 112 to render a menu of coffee bean recipes stored locally on the coffee brewing machine 100 . In this example, the display 112 can cycle through the available recipes based on inputs into the input region, and Block S 120 can retrieve a recipe corresponding to a selection by the user. Thus, as in this example, Block S 110 can receive a manual selection for the coffee bean from a list of coffee beans. Block S 110 can similarly control a touchscreen or an analog interface on the coffee brewing machine 100 to collect a manual selection of a particular coffee bean affiliated with a brewing recipe stored locally or remotely. Block S 110 can also interface with the user's mobile computing device to receive a selection for the coffee bean. Alternatively, Block S 110 can receive manual entry of a code, such as a numeric or alphanumeric code printed directly onto the packaging or printed onto a sticker applied to the packing. However, Block S 110 can receive an identifier of the whole or pre-ground coffee bean in any other suitable way. In any of the foregoing implementations, Block S 110 can receive the coffee source identifier that defines a pointer to a particular coffee bean (e.g., a particular roast) from a particular coffee roaster, a roast date of the particular coffee bean, a batch roast number of the particular coffee bean, and/or a serial number of the packaging containing the particular coffee bean. Block S 110 can thus receive one or more levels (or resolutions) of identifiers of the coffee bean to be brewed in the upcoming brew cycle, such as shown in FIG. 5. In particular, Block S 110 can handle the coffee source identifier defining one of more of a general type of roast that is common to thousands of pounds of beans from the roaster annually, a date of roast that is common to hundreds of pounds of beans roasted by the roaster on one day (or week or other roast period), a roast batch number that is unique to fifteen pounds (15 lbs.) of coffee beans, or a coffee packaging serial number that is unique to one pound (or any similar quantity) of coffee beans. However, Block S 110 can collect, extract, and/or receive the coffee source identifier defining any other identifier for the coffee bean in any other format. 4. Recipe Block S 120 of first method S 100 recites retrieving a recipe for brewing a coffee bean based on the coffee source identifier. (Block S 120 of first method S 100 can similarly recite retrieving a recipe for the coffee bean, the recipe specified by a roaster associated with the coffee bean.) Generally, Block S 120 functions to access a particular coffee brewing recipe specific to the coffee bean—as specified by a coffee roaster—based on the coffee source identifier collected in Block S 110 . As described above, the recipe can be defined by the roaster as a target experience for a cup of coffee brewed from the particular coffee beans. Because each coffee bean harvest can be different, because each roaster can roast beans differently, because the same roaster can roast batches of beans differently, and because variations may exist even amongst beans within the same roast batch from the same roaster and sourced from the same coffee bean harvest, the target experience can be generic to one coffee roast supplied by the roaster (e.g., all dark roast from the roaster), specific to one coffee roast supplied by the roaster for one coffee harvest or coffee season, specific to one roast date (e.g., a day or week) for coffee beans from the roaster, specific to one roast batch number for coffee beans from the roaster, or specific to a single package of coffee beans from the roaster. Generally, the recipe can define a set of quantitative (and qualitative) brewing parameters to (e.g., brew temperature, brew temperature profile, brewing duration, brew or initial water volume, coffee ground contact time with water per unit area, filter medium, filter size, brewing pressure, coffee grind profile, agitation profile, coffee ground-to-water ratio, water quality, user prompts or alarms, recipe expiration date, etc.) that, when executed (within a certain tolerance), achieve a target tasting experience (e.g., flavor, aroma, caffeine content, acidity, bitterness, sweetness, aftertaste, approach, body, finish) from a cup of coffee brewed with the coffee bean. In one implementation, the recipe specifies a static base set of brewing parameters including a brew temperature, start and stop times for agitation, and a steep time (i.e., a time from initiation of a brew cycle to dispensation of fluid from the brew chamber 140 ). Subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can thus execute this limited set of brewing parameters for each brew cycle in which the corresponding coffee bean is used, such as automatically through actuators and sensors incorporated into the coffee brewing machine 100 or by guiding manual execution of one or more brewing parameters at the coffee brewing machine 100 during the brew cycle, as described below. The recipe can also specify a particular filter type and/or size to brew the coffee bean, such as a metal filter or a paper filter of a particular porosity and/or flow rate, as well as additional agitation periods and/or types of agitation, such as stirring or punching (i.e., pushing floating particulate downward, or “breaking the crust”). The recipe can further define a grind profile for coffee beans, such as a grind size and/or a threshold deviation of particulate size in the coffee grounds from the grind size. In the foregoing implementation, the coffee brewing machine 100 can be preset to meter a particular volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 for all brew cycles, and all brew cycles can be specify a static volume or weight of coffee grounds. Alternatively, the recipe can specify a specific ratio of coffee grounds to water (e.g., by mass, weight, or volume ratio). The recipe can thus specify an algorithm for calculating a particular mass, weight, or volume of coffee grounds for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 during a brew cycle for the preset static brew volume of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Similarly, a subsequent Block of first method S 100 can receive a final brew volume (i.e., a final volume of brewed coffee dispensed from the brew chamber 140 during a brew cycle), and the recipe can define an algorithm for calculating an amount of water and an amount of coffee grounds for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 , such as based on a target ratio of coffee grounds to water during the steeping period and a water retention capacity of the grounds (e.g., a volume of water retained per unit weight of dry grounds). The recipe can further include one or more algorithms for calculating or adjusting final brewing parameters (e.g., agitation type and time, steep time, brew temperature or profile, etc.) based on additional variables, such as grind profile or distribution, bean age, location, barometric pressure, ambient air temperature to account for additional factors that may effect flavor of coffee brewed with the coffee beans. For example, the recipe can specify algorithms than adjust brewing parameters based on a make and model, hours, and/or grinder settings of a local (e.g., adjacent or connected) coffee grinder, based on a location of the coffee brewing machine 100 , which may indicate available water quality, elevation or barometric pressure, based on the ambient air temperature, or based on the make and model of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can thus normalize brewing parameters for the upcoming brew cycle to account for any one or more of these variables. In this example, the recipe can include ambient environmental conditions and brewing parameters used by the roaster when formulating the recipe for the coffee bean, such as brew time, brew temperature, brew pressure, agitation time(s) and type(s), and water-to-coffee-ground ratio. Subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can define these parameters as baseline parameters and then adjust the baseline parameters according to one or more algorithms in the recipe based on differences between the ambient environmental conditions during formulation of the recipe and present ambient environmental conditions at the coffee brewing machine 100 in preparation for the upcoming brew cycle. As shown in FIG. 4, in one example process flow, the roaster roasts a batch (e.g., 100 lbs.) of coffee beans and dials in a recipe for the batch by brewing and tasting various cups of coffee with coffee beans from the batch. The roaster then uploads the recipe specific to the batch to a server and prints sticky labels with QR codes that point to the recipe. The roaster then applies the sticky labels to 1 lb. paper coffee bags and fills the bags with whole coffee beans from the roast batch. A customer (e.g., a coffee buyer for a café) then purchases one of the 1 lb. bags of coffee. When the QR code on the bag is later read with a scanner integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 , the coffee brewing machine 100 executes Block S 110 to identity the batch number of the coffee bean in the bag and executes Block S 120 to retrieve the recipe from the remote server before implemented the recipe in subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 to brew a cup of coffee with the coffee bean. As in the foregoing example process flow, Block S 110 can receive the identifier directly from a tag or other wireless transmitter arranged on the coffee packaging, or Block S 110 can extract the identifier from the coffee packaging, such as by implementing machine vision techniques to read a code from an image of the packaging as described above. Block S 120 can then apply the identifier to a local or remote database of recipes to retrieve a particular recipe specific to the coffee bean selected for the upcoming brew cycle. In this implementation, because the recipe is stored electronically and separate from the coffee packaging (e.g., on a remote server), the roaster can update, modify, or tweak the recipe over time, and Block S 120 can retrieve the current (i.e., most up-to-date) recipe specific to the beans to be roasted. Similarly, as in the second method described below, when the roaster enters or modifies a brew recipe for a particular coffee bean, the new or updated brew recipe can be pushed automatically to existing coffee brewing machines, such as to specific coffee brewing machines affiliated (e.g., through contract) with the roaster and/or designated for brewing the particular coffee bean. However, Block S 110 can receive an identifier for the coffee bean in any other way and in any other format, and Block S 120 can function in any other way to retrieve the recipe specific to the coffee bean. 5. Grind Profile One variation of first method S 100 includes Block S 130 , which recites identifying a grind profile of the coffee bean. Generally, because grind profile can affect flavor of a cup of coffee, Block S 130 functions to estimate an average grind size and standard deviation (i.e., a grind profile distribution) of coffee grounds ground from the coffee bean. In one implementation, Block S 130 interfaces with an optical sensor to collect an image of dry grounds and implements machine vision to estimate average grind size and standard deviation of the coffee grounds from the image. For example, an optical sensor integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 or into the user's mobile computing device can capture an image of grounds prior to dispensation of the grounds in the brew chamber 140 of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Alternatively, Block S 130 can estimate the grind profile of the coffee bean based on the make, model, and/or age (e.g., hours of use) of a coffee grinder near the coffee brewing machine 100 and used to grind the coffee bean. For example, Block S 130 can pass a make and model of the coffee grinder to a remote database container coffee grinder data and thus retrieve a particular shape, size, and/or orientation of burrs equipped in the particular coffee grinder used to grind the current coffee bean. For example, a coffee grinder equipped with flat burrs may produce a tighter grind profile than a coffee grinder equipped with round burrs, a coffee grinder equipped with vertically-oriented burrs may produce a tighter grind profile than a coffee grinder equipped with horizontally-oriented burrs, and a coffee grinder equipped with larger burrs may produce a tighter grind profile than a coffee grinder equipped with smaller burrs. Block S 130 can thus predict the grind profile of coffee grounds output from the coffee grinder according to these burr parameters. Block S 130 can also retrieve a coradiality, a burr material (e.g., sintered ceramic or ground steel), burr coating, burr type (e.g., crushing or cutting), burr age, and/or a date of most recent burr-replacement at the coffee grinder and estimate the grind profile of the coffee grounds accordingly. In particular, grind profile standard deviation can be very high for brand new burrs and decrease as the burrs are “broken in.” However, as the coffee grinder continues to be used, the burrs eventually begin to wear out, thus yielding increasingly less uniform grind sizes. For example, once a new coffee grinder is broken in, it may yield grind profiles with relatively small standard deviations (such as shown in FIG. 6A), and older coffee grinders (i.e., coffee grinders with many hours of use) can yield grind profiles with relatively large standard deviations (such as shown in FIG. 6B). Block S 130 can thus implement an algorithm or model linking grind profile standard deviation to coffee grinder age or use to estimate the grind profile distribution of the coffee grounds prior to brewing. For example, Block can implement a generic coffee grinder wear model to estimate grind profile standard deviation of grounds output from any coffee grinder. Alternatively, because coffee grinders from different manufacturers or different models of coffee grinders from the same manufacturer may wear differently, Block S 130 can access a grinder wear model specific to the particular grinder used to grind the coffee bean prior to the brew cycle, such as by retrieving the grind model from a remote server based on a grinder make, model, and/or serial number entered into the user's mobile computing device or into the coffee brewing machine 100 manually or collected automatically from the grinder over wireless communication. In the foregoing implementation, Block S 130 can interface with a wireless communication module with the coffee brewing machine 100 (or within the user's mobile computing device) to download a make, model serial number, and/or hours of operation directly from the coffee grinder, such as over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth communication protocol. Alternatively, Block S 130 can receive a manual entry of grinder hours of operation or other related data and estimate the grind distribution of grounds output from the coffee grinder. Block S 130 can thus predict a grind profile for the coffee bean that is ground fresh and local to the coffee brewing machine 100 , that is ground at a particular machine or by a particular grocer, coffee distributor, or roaster, etc. Alternatively, the roaster can grind the coffee bean and dispense coffee grounds into the coffee packaging prior to sale. In this process flow, Block S 130 can communicate with the roaster to retrieve grind profile data for the coffee bean, such as by downloading a grind data uploaded by the roaster to a grind database accessible by the coffee brewing machine 100 over the Internet. Block can similarly retrieve coffee grinder make, model, and/or hours of operation data from a grinder user by the roaster to grind the coffee to estimate the grind profile for the pre-ground beans, such as with a method described above. Block S 130 can also prompt the user to grind the coffee bean to a particular size. For example, Block S 130 can prompt a user to grind the coffee bean to a particular size specified in the recipe (e.g., a size selected by the roaster and stored with the recipe). In this example, Block S 130 can interface with a digital display 112 incorporated into the coffee brewing machine 100 to render an instruction for selecting a particular grind size at a local coffee grinder. Block S 130 can also interface with the digital display 112 to render an instruction for dispensing a particular weight of coffee grounds (of the particular grind size) into the brew chamber 140 , such as based on the ratio of coffee grounds to water specified in the recipe and/or based on a final brew volume selected by the user. Block S 134 can similarly transmit a grind setting and/or a coffee grind weight to a local coffee grinder, such as a grind setting specified in the recipe and a grind weight based on the selection for the final brew volume. Block S 130 can also adjust the prompted grind size according to the measured or estimated grind profile distribution from the local coffee grinder. Block S 130 can additionally or alternatively cooperate with other Blocks of first method S 100 to adjust the prompted grind size to accommodate for other variables (e.g., ambient temperature, water quality) or to adjust other brewing parameters to compensate for an available ground size and distribution from the grinder. However, Block S 130 can identify a grind profile of the coffee bean, prompt the user to grind the coffee bean to a particular grind size, or automatically set an output of a local coffee grinder in any other suitable way. 6. Fully-Automated Brewing In one variation, first method S 100 executes brew parameters defined in the recipe and/or refined in Block S 140 described below by interfacing with various sensors and actuators within the coffee brewing machine 100 to automatically brew the selected coffee bean, as shown in FIG. 1. For example, a coffee brewing machine executing this variation of first method S 100 can be installed in a residential setting to automatically—or with limited human involvement—brew coffee for an individual in his home. In this variation, first method S 100 can include Block S 140 , which recites setting brewing parameters based on the recipe and the grind profile of the coffee bean. Generally, Block S 140 functions to adjust brewing parameters specified by the recipe for the upcoming brew cycle to compensate for any number of variables that may affect flavor of the brewed coffee, such as grind profile, freshness of grind, age of beans, local barometric pressure, local humidity, local ambient temperature, and water quality used to brew the cup of coffee. In particular, Block S 140 can adjust brewing parameters set in by the recipe to achieve a coffee experience intended by the coffee roaster despite differences in local conditions (i.e., variables) leading up to the brew cycle. For example, as described above, Block S 140 can set brewing parameters defined in the recipe retrieved in Block S 120 as baseline parameters and adjust these parameters according to differences between current conditions and conditions during the formulation of the recipe. For example, Block S 140 can normalize the roaster's recipe to the current conditions at the coffee brewing machine 100 according to environment conditions, grind profile, water quality, age of the coffee bean, freshness of the grind, etc. In one example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters for the upcoming brew cycle to account for local barometric pressure near the coffee brewing machine 100 . For example, because the free boiling point of water is proportional to barometric pressure, and Block S 140 can decrease a peak or average brew temperature in response to lower detected or received barometric pressure near the coffee brewing machine 100 . In this example, responsive to the lower peak or average brew temperature, Block S 140 can increase brew duration and/or agitation accordingly. Furthermore, because barometric pressure can be linked to altitude and altitude linked to location, Block S 140 can determine the location of the coffee brewing machine 100 , such as by polling a GPS sensor in the coffee brewing machine 100 or a GPS sensor in the user's mobile computing device, and Block S 140 can then access an average local barometric pressure for the location, such as from a lookup table. Alternatively, Block S 140 can interface with a pressure sensor incorporated into the coffee brewing machine 100 to measure the local barometric pressure directly, or Block S 140 can communicate with a weather tower to retrieve a local barometric pressure reading. However, Block S 140 can receive local barometric pressure and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In another example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters to account for the ambient air temperature proximal the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one example, Block S 140 assumes that the temperature of the ground coffee bean is approximately the same temperature as the ambient air temperature, and, for lower detected ambient air temperatures, Block S 140 extends the brew duration (i.e., steep time) and softens a temperature ramp profile within the brew chamber 140 to prevent temperature shock to the coffee grounds. Alternatively, for lower ambient air temperatures, Block S 140 can set a faster temperature ramp in the brew chamber 140 to accommodate the brew chamber 140 , water, and/or coffee grounds that are initially cooler in order to minimize contact between the grounds and the water outside of a particular temperature range. Block S 140 can also adjust a steeping period (and an alarm to notify the user that the cup of coffee is ready) according to a predicted thermal energy flux from the brew chamber 140 based on ambient air temperature, a type of coffee cup (e.g., ceramic, paper) to be used, etc. In one example, Block S 140 interfaces with a thermistor or other temperature sensor within the coffee brewing machine 100 or within the user's mobile computing device to detect the ambient air temperature proximal the coffee brewing machine 100 . However, Block S 140 can receive ambient air temperature and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In yet another example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters to account for a quality of water in use at the coffee brewing machine 100 . In particular, tap and bottled water may contain various minerals that affect flavor, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride(s), zinc, iron, copper, and fluoride, and Block S 140 can adjust brewing parameters to account for differences in water used by the roaster and water used at the coffee brewing machine 100 . For example, for water with relatively high mineral content, Block S 140 can reduce both brewing (i.e., steeping) time and average brew temperature to curb chemical reactions between metals in the water and acids in the coffee grounds, which can yield salts that affect the flavor of the coffee and/or upset an acid balance in the coffee. In this example, Block S 140 can also cooperate with Block S 130 to prompt the user to use a finer grind to account for the reduced brew time and brew temperature without substantially sacrificing body of the coffee. In a similar example, Block S 140 can set a brewing time and a brewing temperature according to an amount of dissolved solids in the supplied water, which can affect solvent efficiency of the supplied water. Additionally or alternatively, Block S 140 can set higher brew pressures to accommodate for the reduced brew time and temperature. Block S 140 can also interface with a water mineral sensor integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 to determine the mineral content of the water, or Block S 140 can access a tap water profile database to retrieve tap water data based on the location of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Alternatively, the user can enter a type of bottled water or scan a barcode on a bottle of water used to brew the coffee, and Block S 140 can access a bottled water profile database to retrieve water quality data for the selected bottled water. However, Block S 140 can receive any other water quality data and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In another example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters to account for the grind profile of the coffee bean. In particular, the grind profile—or the average size and standard deviation of particles ground from coffee beans—may affect which and to what extent flavors are extracted from each ground over time during a brew cycle. For example, grounds that are smaller or larger than a target size range can yield undesirable or imbalanced flavors, since grounds that are too small may have been severed from particulate that yields complementary flavors and grounds that are too large limit may predominantly yield flavors that stem from larger molecules, thereby upsetting flavor balance of the brew. In particular, ground size can affect permeability of the grounds, thereby affecting the flavor of coffee brewed within the grounds. Therefore, Block S 140 can adjust brewing parameters (e.g., brewing duration, agitation, brew temperature profile, brewing pressure) to control water-to-ground contact time, thereby controlling flavor extraction from the grounds for the current grind profile. For example, for a grind profile with a proper average ground size but a standard deviation of ground size outside of a threshold standard deviation, Block S 140 can increase brewing duration and decrease average brew temperature to selectively extract more flavors from larger grounds during brewing. In another example, for a grind profile with an average ground size greater than a preferred ground size but a proper standard deviation of ground size, Block S 140 can increase average brew temperature, increase agitation, and increase brewing pressure to extract more balanced flavors from the grounds. However, Block S 140 can receive a grind profile of the coffee bean and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In the foregoing example, implementation, Block S 140 can also adjust brewing parameters to account for the age of the coffee bean and/or the freshness of the grounds. In particular, a whole bean may degrade and become stale over time, thus resulting in diminished flavors in a brew. Degradation of flavor from the coffee bean may be further exacerbated if the bean is stored ground rather than whole. Therefore, Block S 140 can implement a degradation algorithm—such as specific to a coffee bean and stored configuration (i.e., whole or ground)—to model changes in flavors extractable from the coffee bean based on age of the coffee bean (i.e., time since roasting). Block S 140 can also access a coffee bean or roaster database to determine an age of the coffee bean based on the roast date, batch number, or a “ready” date (i.e., a number of specified rest days following the roast date). Alternatively, Block S 140 can interface with Block S 110 to extract a roast or ready date directly from the coffee packaging. In one example, for an older and relatively degraded bean, Block S 140 can increase brewing duration, average brew temperature, and average brewing pressure in order to extract more flavor from the bean to compensate for a decrease in extractable flavors from the bean over time. Similarly, Block S 140 can prompt the user to fill the brew chamber with a larger amount (e.g., volume, mass, or weight) of grounds to compensate for older whole coffee beans (e.g., more than two weeks old) or for coffee grounds that were ground outside of a preferred flavor window (e.g., more than 24 hours prior). Block S 140 can also throw a warning and/or notify the user if the coffee bean is too old to yield a cup of coffee that achieves the coffee experience specified by the roaster. However, Block S 140 can receive an age of the coffee bean and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In another implementation, Block S 140 can adjust the brewing parameters to account for a mass of grounds to be brewed, such as by setting a volume of water to be added to the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 based on the amount of coffee grounds to be brewed. For example, Block S 140 can receive a ratio of water (e.g., in grams) to coffee grounds (e.g., in grams) from the recipe, interface with a scale integrated into the brew chamber 140 to measure a mass of grounds added to the brew chamber 140 , and calculate the volume of water to add to the brew chamber 140 based on the water-to-grounds ratio and the mass of grounds. Alternatively, Block S 140 can receive manual entry of ground mass entered by a user. Yet alternatively, a user can load grounds into the brew chamber 140 with a scoop or known volume, and Block S 140 can estimate the mass of grounds based on manual entry of the number of scoops and a known or estimate density of the coffee ground, such as a density specific to the particular coffee bean as measured by the roaster. Block S 140 can also account for changes in moisture content of the coffee bean over time (e.g., based on the degradation algorithm described above), water absorption volume of the grounds, water absorption rate of the grounds (e.g., based on the grind profile), etc. to estimate a ratio of water added to the brew chamber 140 to water released from the brew chamber 140 upon completion of the brew cycle. For example, Block S 140 can receive a manual entry or user selection of a volume final brew volume (e.g., 4 oz., 8 oz., six cups), calculate a mass of grounds to add to the brew chamber 140 , instruct the user to add the mass of grounds to the brew chamber 140 , and set a volume of water to add to the brew chamber 140 accordingly. However, Block S 140 can receive, estimate, or measure a mass of grounds for consumption during the brew cycle and/or receive a selection for a volume of coffee to output during the brew cycle and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. Block S 140 can further set a pre-wetting and/or water ingress pulse parameters for dispensing water in to the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 140 can set a pre-wetting parameter to add a first 50 g of water the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 and to set a soak timer for the grounds. In another example, Block S 140 can set a water ingress pulse parameter to add a first 50 g of water at a first time, pause for ten seconds, and then add 250 g of water at a specified interval and flow rate up to a total initial water volume (i.e., based on a determined ratio of water in to coffee out) in Block S 154 . However, Block S 140 can function in any other way to set any other brewing parameter. In this variation, first method S 100 can also include Block S 150 , which recites controlling a coffee brewing machine according to the brewing parameters to brew the coffee bean. Generally, Block S 150 functions to implement brewing parameters set in Block S 140 to brew the coffee bean by monitoring sensors integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 and controlling actuators within the coffee brewing machine 100 accordingly. Initially, Block S 150 heats water in a boiler 130 to a target temperature and then actuates the pump 150 to dispense a volume of water—set in Block S 140 —into the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 150 can control a pump to displace water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 , interface with a flow sensor arranged along a fluid supply line to the brew chamber 140 to measure the volume of water displaced into the brew chamber 140 , and then power off the pump when the desired dispensed water volume is reached. Once water and grounds are both dispensed into the brew chamber 140 , Block S 150 implements closed-loop feedback to control a heating element coupled to the brew chamber 140 to maintain the temperature of fluid within the brew chamber 140 based on outputs of a temperature sensor 141 coupled to the brew chamber 140 and a brew temperature set in Block S 140 . For example, Block S 150 can control the heating element and the plunger 170 arranged over the brew chamber 140 to implement heating and pressure profiles set in Block S 140 based on outputs of a temperature sensor 141 (e.g., a thermocouple, a contactless laser-based temp sensor) and a pressure sensor arranged in the brew chamber 140 , respectively. In this example, Block S 150 can control the heating element according to a time-dependent temperature profile, such as by initially increasing the temperature of the grounds and water in the brew chamber 140 from room temperature to a preset target temperature of 195° F. over a preset period of time and holding the temperature at 195° F. for a subsequent preset period of time. Block S 150 can also control an impeller, ultrasonic transducer, or other agitator arranged in or in communication with the brew chamber 140 according to an agitation profile parameter set in Block S 140 . In this example, Block S 150 can control the agitator according to a time-dependent agitation profile, such as by agitating the water and grounds in the brew chamber 140 for a first period of time (e.g., thirty seconds) during the brew cycle and then ceasing agitation for the remainder of the brew cycle. Finally, when a water-ground contact period completes—as specified in Block S 140 —Block S 150 can control a valve 142 coupled to the brew chamber 140 to dispense fluid (i.e., brewed coffee) from the brew chamber 140 into a coffee cup, a coffee pot, a thermos, or any other container. Block S 150 can also implement a post-brew rest period parameter set in Block S 140 to notify a user that the coffee is ready to drink or distribute. For example, Block S 140 can specify that the coffee should rest for 90 seconds after brewing and before consuming, such as based on an optimal consumption temperate set by the roaster and an anticipated cooling time related to an ambient air temperature near the coffee brewing machine 100 . Thus, Block S 150 can implement the brewing parameters set in Block S 140 to reduce a possibility of human error during a brew cycle and to enable substantially accurate and repeatable brewing results. Alternatively, Block S 150 can interface with sensors and actuators arranged within the coffee brewing machine 100 to implement brew parameters defined explicitly within the or to implement a combination of brew parameters defined in the recipe and refined in Block S 140 . However, Block S 150 can function in any other suitable way to control a coffee brewing machine according to brewing parameters—assigned to the coffee bean and/or manipulated in Block S 140 according to local parameters and/or user inputs—to brew the coffee bean. However, in this variation, Blocks of first method S 100 can function in any other way to automatically implement parameters specified in a recipe for a particular coffee bean selected for brewing on a coffee brewing machine. 7. Semi-Automated Brew Cycle In another variation, first method S 100 interfaces with various sensors within the coffee brewing machine 100 , controls a set of actuators within the brewing machine to implement a subset of brewing parameters for the brew cycle, and presents instructions (i.e., prompts, directives) to the user to implement remaining brewing parameters for the brew cycle, as shown in FIG. 7. This variation of first method S 100 can therefore control specific variables of a brew cycle, such as brew temperature, and guide a user through operation of the coffee brewing machine 100 to replicate a coffee experience defined by the corresponding roaster without eliminating a manual component of coffee brewing. In particular, in this variation, first method S 100 can control some brewing variables automatically while guiding manual control of other brewing variables to maintain human involvement and an appearance of a trained, professional barista operating the coffee brewing machine 100 to brew coffee. For example, a coffee brewing machine executing this variation of first method S 100 can be installed in a coffee shop or café and used by professional baristas to brew coffee from patrons. This variation of first method S 100 includes Block S 142 , which recites initiating a brew cycle. Generally, Block S 142 functions to begin the brew cycle by locking brewing parameters, such a brew temperature, a brew time, and agitation types and times. For example, Block S 142 can extract these brew parameters directly from the recipe, and subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can implement these brew parameters during the brew cycle to brew the coffee bean. Block S 142 can also deliver prompts to the user to prepare the coffee brewing machine 100 for the brew cycle and/or receive inputs from the user to adjust the brew parameters. In one example implementation, Block S 142 extracts a filter type from the recipe, as described above, and renders—on the display 112 —an instruction to insert a filter of the filter type into the coffee brewing machine 100 accordingly prior to the initiating the brew cycle. In another example implementation, Block S 142 prompts a user to enter a selection for a final brew volume, such as for a four-ounces, six-ounce, or twelve-ounce pour. Block S 142 can thus set a volume of heating water to be portioned from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 accordingly. In this example implementation, Block S 142 can also calculate a mass, weight, or volume of grounds to be added to the brew chamber 140 based on the final brew volume selection, a water absorption capacity of the grounds, and/or a ratio of water to grounds specified in the recipe, etc., and Block S 142 can then interface with Block S 130 to prompt the user to dispense the calculated amount of coffee grounds into the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 142 can initiate the brew cycle by triggering Block S 152 to heat water in the boiler 130 to a target brew temperature for the coffee bean and render on the display 112 a prompt to select a final brew volume from a set of final volumes (e.g., 4 oz, 6 oz, or 12 oz). Block S 142 can then calculate the corresponding amount of coffee grounds and the volume of water for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 , and Block S 130 can render a text-based instruction on the display 112 to dispense the amount of coffee beans into the brew chamber 140 and to enter an input (e.g., by hitting a “Start” button) when completed. Once a user enters the appropriate input, and Block S 154 can begin to dispense the calculated volume of water into the brew chamber 140 . Alternatively, Block S 142 can initiate the brew cycle by triggering Block S 152 to preheat water in the boiler 130 to the brew temperate, render a prompt on the display 112 to manually dispense a preset amount of coffee grounds into the brew chamber 140 , and then trigger Bock S 154 to portion a preset volume of water into the brew chamber 140 in response to a user input into the coffee brewing machine 100 indicating the grounds were loaded into the brew chamber 140 . However, Block S 142 can function in any other way to initiate a brew cycle. In this variation, first method S 100 also includes Block S 152 , which recites heating water in a boiler 130 to a target temperature specified by the recipe. Generally, Block S 152 controls a heating element coupled to a boiler 130 within the coffee brewing machine 100 to preheat water to the brewing temperature (or to another temperature specified in the recipe) prior to dispensation of a particular volume of water into the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 152 can interface with the temperature sensor 131 (e.g., a thermistor) and implement closed-loop feedback to control the heating element to heat and maintain water in the boiler 130 at the target temperature. However, Block S 152 can function in any other way to control a temperature of water in the boiler 130 within the coffee brewing machine 100 . This variation of first method S 100 also includes Block S 154 , which recites metering a volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 . Generally, Block S 154 functions to displace a set volume of heated water—such as specified in the recipe or calculated in Block S 142 —into the brew chamber 140 by controlling one or more pumps and/or valves within the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one implementation, Block S 154 triggers a valve 132 between the boiler 130 and ambient air to close and powers an electromechanical pump for a particular period of time to pump air into the boiler 130 , thereby displacing heated water from the boiler 130 in to the brew chamber 140 . In this implementation, Block S 154 can calculate the particular period of time from the target volume of water for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 such that the volume of heated water dispensed into the brew chamber 140 can be controlled and achieved without a flow sensor arranged between the boiler 130 and the brew chamber 140 . In a similar implementation, the boiler 130 can be arranged at a height over the brew chamber 140 , and Block S 154 can trigger a valve 132 between the boiler 130 and the brew chamber 140 to open for a particular period of time (similarly calculated) to dispense a particular volume of heated water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 (also without interfacing with a flow sensor arranged therebetween). Alternatively, Block S 154 can interface with a flow sensor and the pump 150 within the coffee brewing machine 100 to monitor a volume of heated water dispensed into the brew chamber 140 and to control the pump accordingly. However, Block S 154 can control any other actuator within the coffee brewing machine 100 to portion a particular volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 in any other suitable way. In this variation, first method S 100 further includes Block S 160 , which recites heating the brew chamber 140 to maintain the volume of water near the target temperature. Generally, Block S 154 dispenses the volume of heated water into the brew chamber 140 , Block S 160 functions to control a heating element coupled to the brew chamber 140 —based on an output of a temperature sensor 141 also coupled to the brew chamber 140 —to maintain the temperature of the water and coffee grounds (i.e., the brew mixture) at the brew temperature. For example, Block S 160 can implement closed-loop (e.g., proportional-integral-derivative, or PID) feedback to hold the temperature of the brew mixture at the target brew temperature. Block S 160 can also function to preheat the brew chamber 140 to the target temperature before Block 154 dispenses (any) heated water into the brew chamber 140 . In particular, Block S 160 can implement closed loop feedback to power the heating element according to the target temperature and to an output of the temperature sensor 141 coupled to the brew chamber 140 , thereby heating the brew chamber 140 up to a temperature substantially identical to the temperature of heated water in the boiler 130 . Thus, when Block S 154 meters heated water from the boiler into the brew chamber 140 , the temperature of the water and the temperature of the brew chamber can be substantially similar such that the temperature of the water—now exposed to the coffee grounds—does not shift substantially from the target brew temperature. Block S 160 can preheat the brew chamber to substantially ensure that the grounds dispensed into the brew chamber are exposed to the heated water dispensed into the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 only at the (or within a threshold range of) the target brew temperature. Block S 154 can thus delay dispensation of heated water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 until the temperature sensor 141 indicates that the brew chamber 140 can reached the target brew temperature and/or has leveled off at a temperature within a threshold range of the target brew temperature, such as within 0.5° C. of the target brew temperature for ten seconds. Block S 160 can further control the heating element to adjust the temperature of the brew mixture during the brew cycle according to a time-dependent temperature profile. For example, Block S 152 can preheat water in the boiler 130 to an initial brew temperature, and Block S 160 can control the heating element in the brew chamber 140 to hold the brew mixture at the initial temperature for a first period of time, then ramp the temperature of the brew mixture up to a second temperature at a particular rate (i.e., change in temperature per unit time), and finally hold the brew mixture at the second temperature before dispensation of the fluid from the brew chamber 140 . However, Block S 160 can control the heating element coupled to the brew chamber 140 to implement any other time-dependent brew temperature profile specified in the recipe set in Block S 142 (or Block S 140 ). Block S 160 can also record temperature data of the brew mixture and/or the brew chamber 140 during the brew cycle. For example, Block S 160 can survey the temperature sensor 141 within the brew chamber 140 at a preset rate (e.g., 10 Hz) during the brew cycle and store measured temperatures locally in memory within the coffee brewing machine 100 , such as with a tag or coffee source identifier identifying the brew cycle number and/or the coffee bean. Block S 160 can additionally or alternatively upload the set of temperatures—with the coffee source identifier—to a remote database of brew data, such as in real-time or asynchronously (e.g., upon completion of the brew cycle). Block S 152 can similarly track temperatures of water within the boiler 130 and store the data locally on the coffee brewing machine 100 and/or upload these data to the remote database, and these boiler 130 and brew chamber 140 temperature data can be analyzed locally or remotely to diagnose, troubleshoot, or preempt problems with operation of the coffee brewing machine 100 . However, Block S 160 can function in any other way to manage the temperature of the brew mixture within the brew chamber 140 during the brew cycle. This variation of first method S 100 also includes Block S 170 , which recites displaying an agitation instruction at a first time during the brew cycle according to the recipe, and Block S 172 , which recites triggering a first alarm to cease agitation at a second time during the brew cycle according to the recipe. Generally, in this variation, Block S 170 functions to prompt a user to agitate the brew mixture and Block S 172 functions to prompt the user to cease agitation based on an agitation schedule specified in the recipe. For example, Block S 154 can trigger a brew cycle timer (e.g., a countdown or a count-up timer) once Block S 154 begins to dispense water into the brew chamber 140 or once Block S 154 finishes dispensing the complete volume of water in to the brew chamber 140 , and first method S 100 can maintain and render the timer on the display 112 . In this example, Block S 170 can prompt a user to manually stir contents of the brewing chamber at a particular time during the brew cycle as specified by the recipe, and Block S 172 can control an audio driver 114 (e.g., a speaker) within the coffee brewing machine 100 to sound an audible alarm to alert the user to cease stirring once a stirring period specified in the recipe elapses. Block S 170 can also render a textual and/or image-based (e.g., a two-color dot-matrix cartoon) instruction for a type of agitation, such as stirring in a circular motion, stirring in a lateral motion, stirring in a zigzag motion, or punching down the grounds from the surface of the brew mixture, such as defined in the recipe for the agitation period. Block S 170 can additionally or alternatively deliver an audible alarm to prompt the user to begin stirring, such as through an audio driver 114 or speaker 114 within the coffee brewing machine 100 , and Block S 172 can additionally or alternatively deliver a visual cue on the display 112 to cease agitation. Block S 172 (and other Blocks of the first method S 100 ) can also render flashes on the display or otherwise modulate an intensity of a backlight of the display to provide a visual cue for a requested manual action at the coffee brewing machine 100 . However, Block S 170 and Block S 172 can cooperate in any other way to guide a user in manually agitating contents of the brew chamber 140 —such as in a particular agitation pattern—and ceasing agitation based on an agitation schedule specified in the recipe. In this variation, first method S 100 can further include Block S 174 , which recites displaying a second agitation instruction at a fourth time during the brew cycle according to the recipe, the fourth time between the second time and the third time. Generally, Block S 174 implements functionality similar to Blocks S 170 and 172 to prompt the user to execute a second agitation schedule. For example, Blocks S 170 and S 172 can cooperate to prompt the user to stir the contents of the brew chamber 140 in a circular motion over a period of ten seconds shortly after Block S 154 dispenses the volume of heated water in to the brew chamber 140 (e.g., from 0:10 to 0:20 on the brew cycle timer), and Block S 174 can prompt the user to punch down the brew mixture for ten seconds following a fifty-second rest period (e.g., from 1:10 to 1:20 on the brew cycle timer). Block S 174 can thus deliver audible and/or visual prompts to begin and then cease a second agitation cycle over a particular period of time during the brew cycle and as defined in the recipe. However, first method S 100 can deliver audible and/or visual instructions to prompt the user to complete any other number and/or type of agitation cycles during the brew cycle. In this variation, first method S 100 further includes Block S 180 , which recites triggering a second alarm to dispense fluid from the brew chamber 140 at a third time during the brew cycle according to the recipe. Generally, Block S 180 functions to prompt the user to manually begin dispensation of fluid (i.e., brewed coffee) from the brew chamber 140 upon completion of a water-to-ground contact time specified in the recipe. For example, Block S 180 can render an textual and/or cartoon-based instruction on the display 112 and/or sound an audible alarm to prompt the user to open a manual valve 142 at a base of the coffee brewing machine 100 , thereby releasing fluid from the brew chamber 140 and into a vessel below, such as directly into a coffee mug, into a coffee pot, or into a thermos. In this example, manual actuation of the valve 142 can enable fluid to passively exit the brew chamber 140 (i.e., via gravity). However, for the coffee brewing machine 100 that also includes a manually-operated plunger 170 , such as shown in FIG. 3, Block S 180 can also prompt to open the valve 142 and to then actuate the plunger 170 into the brew chamber 140 , thereby relatively rapidly evacuating fluid from the brew chamber 140 and terminating contact between the fluid and the coffee grounds, such as specified in the recipe for the coffee bean. For example, Block S 180 can render on the display 112 a textual command to actuate the plunger 170 . Block S 180 can also interface with a linear or arcuate sensor coupled to the plunger 170 or to a pivoting plunger lever 172 , respectively, to track the position of the plunger 170 and to guide displacement of the plunger 170 during actuation by the user, such as by displaying visual indicators of a target position and an actual position of the plunger 170 and prompting the user to align the visual indicators of the target position and the actual position of the plunger 170 through manual displacement of the plunger 170 . Similarly, once substantially all fluid has passively drained from the brew chamber 140 , Block S 180 can prompt the user to actuate the plunger 170 into the brew chamber 140 to evacuate any remaining fluid therefrom. However, Block S 180 can function in any other way to prompt the user to manually release fluid from the brew chamber 140 . In this variation, Blocks of first method S 100 , such as Blocks S 170 , S 172 , and S 180 , can also interface with a local coffee grinder to adjust brew parameters for the brew cycle. For example, Block S 130 can download a grind setting and grind hours (or wear) of a local coffee grinder and estimate a profile and size distribution of grounds loaded into the brew chamber 140 for the current brew cycle, and Blocks S 170 and S 172 can implement methods similar to Block S 140 described above to adjust the first time for displaying the agitation instruction and the second time for triggering the first alarm to cease agitation, respectively, during the brew cycle according to the profile and size distribution of the coffee grounds. Block S 180 can similarly adjust the third time for triggering the second alarm based on the profile and size distribution of the coffee grounds loaded into the coffee brewing machine 100 for the brew cycle. Furthermore, Blocks S 142 , S 170 S 172 , S 174 , and/or S 180 , etc. can additionally or alternatively deliver audible and/or visual prompts for inputting brew parameters (e.g., a final brew volume) and for guiding manual realization of brew parameters (e.g., filter type, agitation, dispensing of fluid from the brew chamber 140 ) through an external electronic device in communication with the coffee brewing machine 100 . For example, the coffee brewing machine 100 can communication with a nearby mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet) over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth communication protocol, and Blocks S 142 , S 170 S 172 , S 174 , and S 180 can deliver audible and visual prompts to a user through a speaker 114 and the display 112 (e.g., a touchscreen), respectively, integrated into the mobile computing device. In this example, Blocks S 142 , S 170 S 172 , S 174 , and/or S 180 can also receive inputs from the user via the mobile computing device, such as through a touchscreen integrated into the mobile computing device. However, Blocks of first method S 100 can interface with any other actuator (e.g., display, speaker) within or outside the coffee brewing machine 100 to communicate data to the user and to receive inputs from the user. In this variation, first method S 100 can further prepare the coffee brewing machine 100 for a subsequent brew cycle with the same coffee bean (e.g., with coffee beans from the same roast batch and/or from the same roaster) or with a different coffee bean (e.g., with coffee beans from a different roast batch and/or from a different roaster). In this implementation, first method S 100 can include Block S 190 , which recites refilling the boiler 130 . For example, Block S 190 can control a valve 132 and/or the pump 150 —similar to Block S 154 described above—to transfer water from the reservoir 120 (i.e., a holding tank) into the boiler 130 to return the water level in the boiler 130 to a particular level following dispensation of heated water from the boiler 130 in Block S 154 . Blocks of first method S 100 can then repeat to brew a second volume (e.g., a cup, a pot) of coffee. In one example in which first method S 100 brews a second cup of coffee from a different coffee bean, Block S 110 can receive a second coffee source identifier, Block S 120 can retrieve a second recipe for a second coffee bean based on the second coffee source identifier, and Block S 142 can initiate a second brew cycle through techniques similar to those described above. Block S 152 can then heat water in the boiler 130 to a second target temperature according to the second recipe, Block S 154 can meter a second volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 , and Block S 160 can heat the brew chamber 140 to maintain the second volume of water near the second target temperature. Finally, Block S 170 can display a second agitation instruction at a first time during the second brew cycle according to the second recipe, Block S 172 can trigger a first alarm to cease agitation at a second time during the second brew cycle according to the second recipe, and Block S 180 can trigger a second alarm to dispense fluid from the brew chamber 140 at a third time during the second brew cycle according to the second recipe. Blocks of first method S 100 can thus repeat to brew sequential volumes of coffee from the same or different coffee beans based on preset recipes corresponding to coffee beans selected for each brew cycle. However, in this variation, Blocks of first method S 100 can function in any other way to semi-automatically implement parameters specified in a recipe for a particular coffee bean selected for brewing on a coffee brewing machine. 8. Second Method and Applications As shown in FIG. 4, a method for transmitting brewing recipes to coffee brewing machines includes: collecting a coffee source identifier corresponding to a coffee roast batch in Block S 210 ; loading a set of brew parameters assigned to the coffee roast batch in Block S 220 , the set of brew parameters including a brew temperature and a steep time; identifying a particular coffee brewing machine in a set of coffee brewing machines in Block S 230 , the particular coffee brewing machine designated to brew coffee from the coffee roast batch; and transmitting the set of brew parameters with the coffee source identifier to the coffee brewing machine 100 over a computer network in Block S 240 , the set of brew parameters defining a recipe for brewing coffee from the coffee roast batch at the coffee brewing machine 100 . Generally, second method S 200 functions to push a recipe for brewing a volume of coffee with a particular coffee bean from an entity associated with roasting the particular coffee bean to a particular coffee brewing machine designated to brew coffee with the particular coffee bean. The particular coffee brewing machine can then execute the first method described above to implement the recipe thus received. For example, once a coffee roaster roasts a batch of coffee beans, the coffee roaster can define, refine, or tweak a brew recipe specific to the roast batch, such as a brew temperature, a steep time (i.e., brew duration), an agitation schedule, a grind profile or grind size, and/or a coffee ground-to-water ratio, etc. In this example, the roaster can brew test cups of coffee on a “master” coffee brewing machine, which can record brewing parameters selected or implemented by the roaster during the test tests, and the roaster can select a preferred or favorite test cup. The master coffee brewing machine can then execute Block S 220 of second method S 200 to generate a recipe for the particular coffee bean based on the set of parameters recorded for the selected test cup, execute Block S 230 to identify coffee brewing machines affiliated with the roaster (e.g., coffee brewing machines in coffee shops that serve coffee beans from the roaster), and execute Block S 240 of second method S 200 to push (i.e., automatically transmit) the recipe to the identified coffee brewing machine(s) with an identifier of the corresponding coffee bean. Thus, a coffee brewing machine that received the recipe can execute the first method described above to implement the recipe when the corresponding coffee bean is scanned or selected for a subsequent brew cycle at the coffee brewing machine 100 . Blocks of second method S 200 can thus be implemented on coffee brewing machine, such as the coffee brewing machine 100 described above and shown in FIG. 3 or a master coffee brewing machine as described above. Blocks of second method S 200 can additionally or alternatively be implemented on a remote computer system, such as a computer network or a remote server. Block S 210 of second method S 200 recites collecting a coffee source identifier corresponding to a coffee roast batch. Generally, Block S 210 of second method S 200 functions to receive an identifier for the present coffee bean and to pair this identifier with the recipe specific to the coffee bean and generated in Block S 220 . Block S 210 can therefore implement methods or techniques similar to those of Block S 110 described above to collect the coffee source identifier. For example, Block S 210 can receive an optical scan of a bar code, a QR code, a serial number, or any other symbol printed or arranged on a package containing or designated to contain the coffee bean, and Block S 210 can pair this identifier with the recipe generated in Block S 220 . In another example, Block S 210 can receive a batch number, a serial number (e.g., a unique ID) or an other alphanumeric sequence scanned from an RFID tag arranged on or designated for a package containing the coffee bean, and Block S 210 can pair this alphanumeric sequence with the recipe generated in Block S 220 . However, Block S 210 can collect an identifier of the coffee bean in any other form and in any other way and pair this identifier with a particular batch, roast, or group of coffee beans. Block S 220 of second method S 200 recites loading a set of brew parameters assigned to the coffee roast batch, the set of brew parameters including a brew temperature and a steep time. Generally, Block S 220 functions to collect brew parameters selected by the roaster for the coffee bean (e.g., the roast or roast batch of coffee beans) and to aggregate these brew parameters into a recipe for the coffee bean. In one implementation, Block S 220 records brew parameters previously applied at a “master” coffee brewing machine during a test brew cycle for the coffee bean. For example, Block S 220 can collect a brew temperature and a steep time applied at the master coffee brewing machine during a previous test brew cycle, the previous test brew cycle selected by the roaster as the preferred or favorite test cup for the coffee bean. Block S 220 can also collect data corresponding to manual inputs supplied by the roaster during the selected test brew cycle and incorporated these manual inputs into the recipe. For example, Block S 220 can record a first time during the selected test brew cycle at which the roaster begins agitation of fluid within a brew chamber 140 of the master coffee brewing machine, a second time at which the roaster ceases agitation of the fluid, and a steep time corresponding to an elapsed time between initiation of the text brew cycle and dispensation of fluid from the brew chamber 140 of the master coffee brewing machine. Block S 220 can thus automatically define agitation start and stop times and steep time in the recipe for the coffee based on these manual inputs recorded at the master coffee brewing machine during the test brew cycle corresponding to the selected test cup of coffee brewed with the coffee bean. Block S 220 can additionally or alternatively prompt the roaster to manually enter specific agitation instructions for detected agitations periods during the selected test brew cycle, and Block S 220 can incorporate these data into the recipe accordingly. Alternatively, Block S 210 can prompt manual selection or entry of the coffee source identifier, Block S 220 can prompt manual selection or entry of brew parameters for the coffee bean, and Blocks S 210 and S 220 can cooperate to generate the recipe associated with the coffee source identifier and defining the selected or entered brew parameters. In one example, Block S 210 can prompt the roaster to enter a batch number of the coffee bean or to select a sequence of coffee source identifiers of coffee bags allocated for the coffee bean. In another example, Block S 220 can prompt the roaster to manually enter agitation data for the coffee bean, such as agitation type, agitation start time, and/or agitation duration for one or more agitation periods for a brew cycle with the coffee bean. In this example, Block S 220 can also prompt the roaster to enter a total time for the brew cycle, a volume of water to dispense into the brew chamber 140 , and/or any other parameter for a brew cycle specific to the coffee bean, and Block S 220 can generate the recipe for the coffee bean (e.g., for the roast batch, for the roaster, etc.) accordingly. Block S 230 of second method S 200 recites identifying a particular coffee brewing machine in a set of coffee brewing machines, the particular coffee brewing machine designated to brew coffee from the coffee roast batch. Generally, Block 230 functions to automatically populate a list of coffee brewing machines to which to push the recipe for the coffee bean, the selected coffee brewing machines likely or possibly to brew the coffee bean in the future. In particular, Block S 230 identifies coffee brewing machines operated by the roaster and/or operated by entities affiliated with roaster (e.g., by contract) and therefore designated as coffee brewing machines that may brew coffee beans roasted and supplied by the roaster. In one implementation, Block S 230 accesses a list of coffee brewing machines associated with one or more cafés or shops designated to receive the roast batch. For example, the roaster can roast a single batch of coffee designated for a single coffee shop, and Block S 230 can access an order form for the roast batch (such as stored locally on the master coffee brewing machine), identify the designated coffee shop for the order from the order form, and retrieve a list of coffee brewing machine operated by the designated coffee shop, such as from a remote server or database containing location and/or shop affiliation data for each coffee brewing machine configured to execute the first method. In another example, Block S 230 can retrieve a list of all coffee brewing machines operated by coffee shops affiliated with the coffee roasters, such as stored locally on the master coffee brewing machine or remotely on a database owned by the roaster. Block S 230 can collect a list of one or more unique addresses, each address affiliated with a unique coffee brewing machine. For example, Block S 230 can collect an Internet Protocol (IP) address or an email address assigned to each identified coffee brewing machine. However, Block S 230 can identify affiliated coffee brewing machines and populate a list of any other suitable type of addresses for the identified coffee brewing machines in any other suitable way. Block S 240 of second method S 200 recites transmitting the set of brew parameters with the coffee source identifier to the coffee brewing machine 100 over a computer network, the set of brew parameters defining a recipe for brewing coffee from the coffee roast batch at the coffee brewing machine 100 . Generally, Block S 240 functions to push automatically the recipe generated in Block S 220 —tagged with the coffee source identifier collected in Block S 210 —to one or more coffee brewing machines identified in Block S 230 such that these coffee brewing machines are already loaded with the recipe specific to the coffee bean when brewing cycles with the coffee bean are later initiated at the coffee brewing machine 100 s . For example, Block S 240 can upload the recipe, the coffee source identifier, and the list of addresses for the identified coffee brewing machines to a computer network, such as over Wi-Fi, cellular, or Ethernet communication, and the computer network can distribute the recipe and the coffee source identifier to the specified coffee brewing machine 100 s. In one implementation, Block S 240 transmits the recipe and the coffee source identifier for a new coffee bean—such as a new type of coffee bean or a new roast batch of the same type of coffee bean now available from the roaster and/or designated for a particular café, coffee shop, or coffee brewing machine, etc.—to the identified coffee brewing machines. In this implementation, the recipe thus defines a new recipe specifying a set of brew parameters for a new type, batch, or source, etc. of coffee bean. In another implementation, Block S 240 transmits the recipe and the coffee source identifier for an existing coffee bean corresponding to an earlier recipe previously loaded onto one or more coffee brewing machines, such as for an existing type of coffee bean supplied by the roaster or a previous roast type or roach batch provided by the roaster. Thus, in this implementation, Block S 240 can distribute the recipe to one or more coffee brewing machines to override a previous recipe (i.e., a previous set of brew parameters) associated with the coffee source identifier and stored in memory on the coffee brewing machine 100 s. However, Blocks S 210 , S 220 , S 230 , and S 240 of second method S 200 can cooperate in any other way to generate a new recipe for a new coffee source identifier and/or to update an existing recipe for a current coffee source identifier and to distribute (i.e., push) the new and/or updated recipe to associated coffee brewing machines. The methods and coffee brewing machine of the invention can be embodied and/or implemented at least in part as a machine configured to receive a computer-readable medium storing computer-readable instructions. The instructions can be executed by computer-executable components integrated with an application, applet, host, server, network, website, communication service, communication interface, hardware/firmware/software elements of a user computer or mobile device, or any suitable combination thereof.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the processing of coffee, typically the first step is to subject green coffee beans to a roasting process. This process causes thermal decomposition and chemical changes within the beans at which time the familiar aroma and flavour development occurs. A by-product of the roasting process is carbon dioxide gas. Following roasting, coffee almost immediately begins to release carbon dioxide. When in the whole bean state the release of carbon dioxide gas is relatively slow. In some cases it may take in excess of two weeks for all internal carbon dioxide gas built up during the roasting process to be released. In contrast, grinding coffee beans to produce ground roasted coffee results in the release of carbon dioxide and volatile aromatics over a much shortened time frame. As a result of the discharge of carbon dioxide gas, tightly packaged coffee that has not been sufficiently degassed can cause an undesired expansion (and in some cases rupture) of packaging materials. For that reason both roasted coffee beans and ground roasted coffee are commonly transported and stored in bins or open containers following the roasting/grinding process where they are allowed to degas for anywhere from a few hours to upwards of one to two days so that the product that is eventually packaged is essentially carbon dioxide free. Ground roasted coffee also readily absorbs atmospheric moisture and is a good desiccant. In addition, whether it be whole bean or ground, roasted coffee oxidizes when it comes into contact with air, resulting in increased levels of acidity and a general degradation in taste. For these reasons, after being sufficiently degassed coffee is often vacuum packaged in a tightly sealed container to avoid continued contact with air. Alternately, coffee is sometimes packaged in a nitrogen filled container in order to avoid oxidation through contact with air. Unfortunately, the above described methods of processing roasted coffee suffer from a number of substantial draw backs that affect the flavour and aroma of the coffee, and ultimately its price and desirability to consumers. First, degassing coffee increases exposure of the coffee to air and results in enhanced oxidation. Commonly used bulk handling techniques further exasperate the oxidation problem by increasing the contact of the roasted coffee with air. In addition, typical bulk handling equipment that is used in coffee processing (for example conveyor belts, screw conveyors, air conveyors etc.) have a tendency to separate fine and coarse particles and can result in an uneven mixing of fine and coarse particles within individual packaged portions. Ground coffee that is allowed to come into contact with air for any extended length of time runs the risk of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere causing a reduction in the quality of the coffee. It has also been found that a substantial portion of the aromatics associated with roasted coffee are stripped off from either the whole bean or the ground product when the carbon dioxide liberated from the coffee is removed. Appreciating that a significant loss of the aromatics from roasted coffee results in a degradation of the coffee's flavour and taste, others have developed elaborate systems that attempt to capture volatile aromatics, and later condense and process them for use in the production of instant coffee crystals. Finally, a further limitation associated with current coffee processing methods concerns the common practice of vacuum packaging coffee. Where coffee has been packaged within a container under a vacuum environment, immediately upon opening the container the coffee is instantly, and forcefully, aerated causing enhanced and accelerated oxidation. There is therefore a need for an improved method of processing roasted coffee that addresses a number of the limitations present in such methods as are currently in use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention therefore provides a method of processing roasted coffee that provides a means to minimize oxidation, maximize the retention of volatile aromatics, minimize moisture absorption and helps to minimize the separation of fine and course particles in the event that the coffee is subjected to a grinding process. Accordingly, in one of its aspects the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee to improve the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the roasted coffee, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving coffee therein; purging said containers of contained air through flushing said containers with an inert gas; transporting and delivering roasted coffee to a grinding circuit; grinding said roasted coffee directly into a container filling apparatus; with said container filling apparatus, delivering said ground coffee directly into said purged containers; and, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee and to minimize contact of said ground roasted coffee with the air. In a further aspect the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee beans to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the coffee beans following roasting, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving roasted coffee beans therein, purging said containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas and thereafter maintaining said purged containers in a generally upright position with said inert gas retained therein to prevent the influx of air into said purged containers, without delay and without allowing said roasted coffee beans to accumulate in storage bins or staging areas transporting and delivering said roasted coffee beans directly to a container filling apparatus, with said container filling apparatus delivering said roasted coffee beans directly into said purged containers, and, thereafter, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee beans and to minimize contact of said roasted coffee beans with the air. In yet a further aspect the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide gas and aromatics liberated from the coffee, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving roasted coffee therein, purging said containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas and maintaining said purged containers in a generally upright position with said inert gas retained therein, transporting and delivering roasted coffee to a grinding circuit located within an enclosure having an oxygen depleted atmosphere, grinding said coffee directly into a container filling apparatus, with said container filling apparatus delivering said ground coffee directly into said purged containers, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee and to minimize the contact of said roasted coffee with the air, said steps of said method completed with minimal delay between successive steps to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide gas liberated from said coffee prior to the sealing of said coffee within said containers. Further aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken together with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings which show the preferred embodiments of the present invention in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing that graphically depicts the primary stages of one of the embodiments of the preferred method according to the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention may be embodied in a number of different forms. However, the specification and drawings that follow describe and disclose only some of the specific forms of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims that follow herein. According to the method of the present invention, one or more containers are prepared for receiving and packaging coffee therein. Depending upon the end use of the packaged coffee, shipping requirements, retail display considerations and other factors, it will be appreciated that a wide variety of different containers or packages may be utilized. For example, the containers may be of a rigid variety formed from metallic alloys, cellulose products, and/or plastics or other synthetic materials. Similarly, the containers may also be of a flexible or semi-rigid variety, including pre-formed synthetic bags, or bags made from cellulose or other textile materials coated for gas impermeability. In other instances the containers may be constructed from continuous rolls of plastic or other synthetic material that are cut and hermetically sealed to desired sizes in what is often referred to as a form, fill and seal circuit. Regardless of the particular form of container utilized, the preparation of the containers for receiving coffee typically involves the placement of the containers on a conveyor belt or other assembly system such that they can be filled and sealed or form filled and sealed in an efficient and timely fashion. The preparation of the containers for receiving coffee pursuant to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes purging the containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas. Most commonly inert gas would be supplied to the containers through a series of flushing lines directed into the containers while on the assembly line of a processing plant operation. The inert gas used to purge the containers in many cases will have a density either exceeding or relatively close to that of air. Once flushed and purged, the containers proceed through subsequent processing stages in a generally upright orientation to allow the inert gas to remain within the interior of the containers, thereby preventing the influx of air. While a variety of different non-toxic inert gases could be utilized, due to its general availability and relative inexpense, in a preferred embodiment of the invention nitrogen gas is used to purge the containers. The method of the present invention also calls for the transporting and delivering of roasted coffee to a grinding circuit in one embodiment, or for transporting and delivering whole roasted coffee beans directly to a container filling apparatus in an alternate embodiment. Through a thorough understanding of the invention it will be appreciated that the invention is independent of the precise roasting method that is employed, and that a variety of different methods of roasting and roasting equipment could be used. For example, a typical roasting process could involve subjecting green coffee beans to temperatures of between approximately 390 and 460 degrees Fahrenheit causing pyrolysis or thermal decomposition within the beans. At elevated temperatures in this range water is evaporated from the beans followed by pyrolysis causing chemical changes within the bean that result in the familiar aroma and flavour of roasted coffee. During the pyrolysis process carbon dioxide gas is formed and typically builds up within internal cavities in the coffee beans. The specific target temperature to which the coffee beans are elevated and the length of time that they are maintained at that temperature can vary dramatically depending upon the nature and origin of the beans and the desired flavour and colour of the end product. In general, higher roasting temperatures maintained for longer lengths of time result in a somewhat stronger, more robust and darker flavoured coffee. In any event, once the coffee has reached a specific target temperature and has been maintained at that level for the desired length of time the coffee is typically quenched to slow down or retard the pyrolysis reaction. Again the specific method of quenching the roasted coffee may vary broadly, however, typically the hot roasted coffee beans are passed through a cooling chamber where their temperature is reduced through exposure to air, or through quenching with water or or an inert gas such as nitrogen. In accordance with the present invention the coffee exiting the roasting process is preferably quenched and cooled to a temperature of between approximately 80 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Thereafter, in one preferred embodiment the roasted coffee beans are quickly transported and delivered to a grinding circuit to reduce the coffee to granules of a desired size range. The roasted beans are preferably delivered to the grinding circuit without delay to avoid loss of carbon dioxide and to minimize oxidation. As a means to minimize the contact of the beans with air, they may be transported to the grinding circuit in an oxygen depleted environment. Such an environment can be attained through the use of a screw conveyor, by injecting or blowing carbon dioxide or an inert gas onto the beans during transport, or through transporting the coffee within a sealed enclosure where the oxygen has been removed or depleted. When delivered to the grinding circuit the extent to which the coffee is ground will be to a large part dependent upon the coffee's end use. For most residential and commercial uses a granule size of between approximately 0.01 inches and 0.1 inches (Tyler screen size of between #10 and #50 mesh) is sufficient. The particular type of grinding equipment that is utilized has little, if any, bearing upon the invention. Practically any commonly used coffee grinding apparatus could be used. It is expected that in most instances the coffee beans will be ground through the use of a traditional roller mill. Since the grinding of roasted coffee beans accelerates the release of carbon dioxide, in the preferred embodiment of the present inventive method the beans are ground to within their desired size range and deposited immediately and directly into a container filling apparatus that delivers the ground coffee directly into the previously prepared and purged containers. Preferably the grinding circuit is positioned immediately above the filling apparatus such that the ground coffee granules fall directly into the filler apparatus as they exit the grinding and sizing machinery. Essentially, the coffee is “ground” directly into the filling apparatus. Once received within the filling apparatus, the ground roasted coffee is delivered directly to the purged containers by way of a screw conveyor, through a gravity feed mechanism, or through a feeding weigh scale apparatus that deposits coffee into the containers on the basis of weight as opposed to volume. It has been found that in some cases the liberation of carbon dioxide gas from the ground coffee may be significant enough to remove the necessity of purging the containers. In such instances the coffee is ground directly into upright containers that have not been previously flushed with inert gas. Being more dense than air, the carbon dioxide given off by the ground coffee displaces air within the container until the container is essentially oxygen free. With the liberation of carbon dioxide from the coffee generally enhanced at elevated temperatures, the containers may also be heated or cooled as required to stabilize carbon dioxide production and to assist in controlling the amount of oxygen within the container. When coffee is ground not only is the liberation and loss of the carbon dioxide greatly accelerated, so to is the potential for oxidation. For that reason under the present method there is preferably no airveying or conveying of ground coffee through the use of conveyor belts or similar commonly used bulk handling equipment that expose the product to the air. To further reduce oxidation and enhance carbon dioxide retention, an external source of carbon dioxide or inert gas may be supplied to the grinding and/or filling circuits. Blowing carbon dioxide or inert gas into grinding and/or filling circuits tends to reduce oxygen levels within the working environment and minimize the contact of the coffee with oxygen present in the air. Alternately, the grinding and/or filling stages may be carried out within sealed enclosures that either have substantially all of the oxygen within them removed or that operate in a modified oxygen depleted atmosphere. Typically where the grinding and/or filling stages are enclosed, they would be vacuumed or flushed with carbon dioxide or an inert gas (such as nitrogen) to remove or reduce oxygen levels. Thereafter, once grinding and filling commences the natural liberation of carbon dioxide from the coffee will have a tendency of maintaining a zero, or a substantially depleted, oxygen level within the immediate atmosphere surrounding the coffee. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the above described process may be repeated for whole bean coffee processing, with the exclusion of the grinding stage. When processing whole bean coffee, the roasted beans are transported and delivered directly to the container filling apparatus for deposition within the containers in the same fashion as described above with respect to ground roasted coffee. Once again, to minimize oxidation and the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics, the roasted beans are delivered from the roasting circuit to the container filling apparatus without delay, and without allowing the beans to accumulate in storage bins or staging areas as has traditionally been the practice when degassing. In addition, and as in the case of the method of processing ground coffee described above, the beans may be transported from the roasting circuit to the subsequent container filling apparatus in an oxygen depleted environment. This may be accomplished through the use of enclosed screw conveyors, by injecting carbon dioxide or inert gases into the bean transportation circuit, or by transporting the beans from the roasting to the filling stages within a sealed enclosure which the oxygen has been removed or depleted. Whether handling whole roasted coffee beans or ground roasted coffee, following deposition of the coffee within the previously prepared and purged containers the containers are thereafter sealed to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the coffee, and to minimize contact of the coffee with air. Depending upon the particular construction of the container, the method of sealing may vary. For example, where the containers are rigid and formed from metal alloys, cellulose, or synthetic plastics, rigid lids may be applied through methods commonly used in the canning and packaging industries. Where the containers are in the form of flexible synthetic bags, typically their tops would be hermetically sealed or enclosed with the use of adhesives. Under the above described method, the amount of time from the point when coffee beans exit the roasting circuit until they are either directly packaged within containers or ground and then subsequently packaged is kept to a minimum. The roasted coffee is not allowed to sit in storage bins or staging areas to degas. For that reason the coffee will continue to liberate a significant amount of carbon dioxide gas after it has been packaged and sealed within its container. To accommodate this liberation of gas, in the preferred embodiment of the invention the containers are equipped with a pressure-sensitive one-way valve that permits internal gas pressure that exceeds a pre-determined value to be bled off from the interior of the container. The one-way nature of the valve also prevents the influx of air into the container and maintains a high inert gas and/or carbon dioxide environment within the container. The pressure sensitivity of the valve ensures that the valve normally remains in a closed position, in which case the integrity of the seal of the container is maintained. Only when the internal gas pressure exceeds a pre-determined value will the valve begin to slightly open to allow pressure to be bled off. It will be appreciated that the construction of the container and the materials from which it is formed will to a large extent dictate the pressure at which the one-way valve must bleed off built-up internal pressure to maintain the integrity of the container. To prevent air from entering the container the valve should be designed so that it will only open when the internal gas pressure exceeds the outside atmospheric pressure by a specified amount. It will be appreciated from an understanding of the above description that utilization of the method to process and package either roasted coffee beans or ground roasted coffee will result in minimal oxidation of the coffee and minimal loss of liberated carbon dioxide and aromatics. Directly transporting coffee between successive stages in the process with minimal or no delays reduces the overall time from roasting to packaging to within a preferred range of from one to five minutes. Since at no point is the coffee allowed to be retained within storage bins or staging areas to degasify, the opportunity for oxidation and the loss of aromatics is significantly reduced. In addition, when processing ground coffee, grinding the coffee and depositing it immediately and directly into a filler apparatus without the employment of conveyor systems and other commonly used bulk handling machinery further and significantly reduces the time from roasting to packaging and the exposure of the coffee to air. Finally, carrying out the transportation, grinding and/or filling operations within sealed enclosures having an oxygen depleted atmosphere virtually eliminates the opportunity for any significant oxidation of the coffee before packaging and further helps to prevent the loss of liberated carbon dioxide which carries with it valuable and desirable aromatics. As a result, coffee processed and packaged according to the described method tends to be fresher, less acidic, better tasting, and generally has a better aroma. Since the method minimizes the exposure of the roasted coffee to air, the coffee is less susceptible to the deleterious effects of moisture retention that can result through exposure to air, particularly in the case of ground roasted coffee. It is to be understood that what has been described are the preferred embodiments of the invention and that it may be possible to make variations to these embodiments while staying within the broad scope of the invention. Some of these variations have been discussed while others will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.","20020110626"

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a grinder for grinding coffee beans, to a method for grinding coffee beans and to a coffee machine, in particular a fully automatic coffee machine. BACKGROUND The appropriate fineness of a coffee powder is a prerequisite for successful coffee preparation. It determines the speed at which the water can flow through the coffee powder and the time period during which aromas and flavors can be released from the coffee powder. This time is called extraction time and it is a quality criterion for the appropriate extraction of the flavors and aromas of the respective coffee beverage. The extraction intensity of a coffee beverage is decisively influenced by the grinding degree of the ground coffee, in addition to contact pressure, water temperature, water quality and bean properties. The grinding degree describes the fineness with which the bean is ground. The grinding process of coffee beans produces a fineness distribution, i.e. not all coffee particles have the same size but are subject to a particle size distribution typical for coffee. The median X50 [μm] of the fineness distribution is a proven measurement for assessing the fineness of the ground coffee. It denotes the value of the particle size that lies in the middle of the quantity distribution (e.g. an idealized ball diameter for measuring instruments with laser diffraction principle). This means that one half of all particles is smaller, and the other half is larger than the median. The finer a grind, the larger the total particle surface area and thus the contact time of the water with the coffee powder. A balanced ratio between aroma and strength is achieved when approximately 18 to 22% of the aromatic substances are dissolved from the coffee. The optimal contact time for espresso preparation is in the range of 25-30 s and for filter coffee several minutes. Under-extraction leads to a too acidic and over-extraction to a too bitter coffee taste. The appropriate grinding degree of espresso powder is at a median of maximum 350 μm, that of café creme at 550 μm and that of filter grinding at 700 μm. The grinding degree of the coffee powder can usually be adjusted in coffee machines with a grinder. High-quality machines even allow infinitely variable adjustment of the grinder and compensate for undesirable boundary conditions (e.g. thermal expansion, grinding disc wear, etc.) by readjusting the grinder components. Some systems use the extraction time of the coffee beverage as an indirect feature to check the appropriate setting of the grinding degree. For the preparation of a high-quality coffee beverage, the appropriate and product-related setting of the grinding degree plays a major role. Two main proven designs of coffee grinders are known which are used in coffee machines. On the one hand, disc grinders and on the other hand cone grinders. Both types of grinders have in common that they consist of two grinding tools, wherein one of these tools is fixed and the other is driven. As a result of the rotational movement of the one grinding tool, the beans are drawn into a grinding gap and are ground ever finer via the tapering grinding gap width. The smallest distance between the two grinding tools is decisive for the produced grinding degree of the coffee powder. To change the grinding degree, the fixed tool can be adjusted relative to the rotating tool so that the distance is varied. These systems are geometry-based methods for changing the grinding degree. According to the technical teachings of EP 2 286 699 B1, it is provided that the grinder for a coffee machine has a first grinding disc that can be driven about an axis of rotation by a drive means and a second grinding disc. The second grinding disc is fixed in a screw-in part which can be screwed into a housing and can be rotated relative to the housing by adjusting means. Thus, a grinding gap between the two grinding discs can be adjusted. The adjusting means are designed coaxially to the screw-in part, which interacts with an adjusting wheel that can be rotated by adjusting means. The grinder also has a feed opening for feeding the coffee beans to be ground and a discharge opening for discharging the coffee ground between the two grinding discs. For adjusting the grinding gap, the grinder has a central adjustment facility which is infinitely variable. An existing problem of these grinder systems is the determination of a zero point at which a minimum degree of fineness can be defined. Only if this is successful, a grinding degree suitable for the product can be set directly and precisely in relation to this zero point. A prerequisite for this is particularly high manufacturing accuracy in the overall design of the grinder (e.g. high axial run-out accuracy in the disc grinder). Furthermore, in conventional coffee grinders, disturbing influences such as thermal expansion of the grinder components, grinding disc wear, bean change, etc. can only be compensated indirectly (e.g. by evaluating the extraction time). Heat influences in particular lead to varying grinding degrees and different swelling behavior of the coffee powder in the brewing unit and are thus the main cause of fluctuating run-down times. As a result of these facts, long adjustment cycles are often required to ideally adjust the grinder of a coffee machine to the desired product and taste profile. Furthermore, the grinding degree can usually only be set and adjusted for a specific product. SUMMARY An object of the invention therefore is to further develop a generic grinder in a functionally advantageous manner. According to an embodiment of the invention, a grinder for grinding coffee beans comprises a first grinding tool and a second grinding tool forming a grinding gap, wherein the second grinding tool is rotatable or is rotated relative to the first grinding tool during operation of the grinder (i.e. during grinding of coffee beans), wherein the grinder has at least one force generation device for applying a force F, which is preferably also adjustable during operation, to the first grinding tool or the second grinding tool, which is transmitted to the coffee beans, wherein the force F is directed in such a way that it presses the respective grinding tool to which the force F is applied in the direction of the respective other grinding tool. The force can be applied during operation, but also when the grinding tools are at a standstill or not in operation. The grinder according to the invention serves or is designed for grinding coffee beans. It can be used as a stand-alone unit or integrated into a coffee machine, e.g. a fully automatic coffee machine. The grinder comprises a first grinding tool and a second grinding tool. The grinding tools form a grinding gap or define such a grinding gap from opposite sides. This grinding gap can be designed flat or increasingly towards the center, and preferably defines a plane, more preferably a plane of symmetry. The second grinding tool can be rotated relative to the first grinding tool, in particular rotatably driven by a drive unit such as a motor. The grinder also has at least one force generation device for applying a force F to the first grinding tool or second grinding tool, which is transmitted to the coffee beans to be ground. Thus, in addition to the weight of the grinding tools, a further force is added to the weight of the grinding tools, which can be adjusted during operation of the grinder and which is applied by the force generation device. In this process, the force F is directed in such a way that it presses the respective grinding tool to which the force F is applied, in particular axially in the direction of the respective other grinding tool. The force generation device thus presses the two grinding tools together and not, as is known from the prior art, away from each other. The application of force virtually replaces the support of the grinding tool on an abutment. With an adjustable force, a product-specific optimum grinding degree can be achieved that remains largely constant even under changed process conditions. It may be advantageously provided that a product-specific grinding degree is set by applying a force with an adjustable process force. In this respect, it can also be provided that when changing the type of coffee or the product type (e.g. from espresso to café crème), a product-specific setting of the grinding degree or changeover is automatically performed when the product is received from a fully automatic coffee machine in which the grinder is integrated. This setting of the grinding degree can be carried out extremely quickly with the invention, for example to change from a setting of the grinding degree for espresso to a setting of the grinding degree for café crème. Since the adjustment or changeover is very fast, a second grinder may even be unnecessary in a fully automatic coffee machine. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preparing coffee with a coffee machine, in particular with a fully automatic coffee machine, and with a grinder of the above type, in which coffee beans are ground with the grinder and in which coffee of a specific type is prepared in a brewing unit from the coffee beans and water. In one embodiment, the grinding degree is automatically adjusted or changed, depending on the type of coffee (for example espresso or café crème), before grinding, in the case of a change in the type of coffee, and further depending on the amount of water and the amount of ground coffee and optionally depending on additives such as milk. During operation of the grinder, one of the two grinding tools can be at a standstill and the second of the two grinding tools can be rotatably operated by a drive unit, e.g. a motor. However, both grinding tools can also rotate, in particular in opposite directions to each other. The force generation device can act upon both the first and second grinding tool, so that a more even distribution of force is achieved. However, in terms of design it is easier if the force generation device only acts upon one grinding tool, in particular the one at a standstill of the two grinding tools. Furthermore, a force generation device can also act upon the first grinding tool and upon the second grinding tool. In this case, according to one embodiment, it may be provided that the force generation device has at least one spring and a device for setting a pretensioning force of the spring, in particular in the form of a servomotor. This embodiment is particularly easy to implement in terms of design and is easily controllable and/or adjustable. It should generally be noted that it is not primarily important which of the grinding tools (also referred to as “cutting tools” in the following), driven or stationary grinding tool, has a degree of freedom in the direction of the process force and is actively subjected to a force in this direction. The force adjustment can be automatic (e.g. motorized) or manual (e.g. adjusting wheel). With motorized adjustment, a control loop is conceivable, wherein the grinding degree is changed if the last extraction times deviate from the target run-down time. The constructive implementation of a force control can be realized in different ways. One possibility is the compression of a mechanical spring by a certain distance x with known force-displacement characteristic curve. However, there are also other solutions for applying a defined force to one of the cutting tools. First of all, a pneumatic approach is conceivable here, wherein one grinding disc carrier can be actively pressed against the other with variable air pressure. A passive embodiment would be a gas pressure spring with a fixed force-displacement characteristic curve, wherein only a certain grinding degree would then be adjustable in the grinder. However, springs are also available with variable gas pressure. Alternatively, however, it may also be provided that the force generation direction is based on a fluid operating principle. Since the distance between the grinding tools or cutting tools in the disc grinder only has to change slightly up to 0.2 mm depending on the process force during grinding, hydraulic solutions with fluids of higher compression modules are also possible to control the force. Even then, the system would have a damping effect during grinding. A rubber diaphragm can be used to apply force, which is filled with water via an adjustable pressure reducer. A hydraulic water system is available in coffee machines anyway and could be used to regulate the grinding degree. Furthermore, the force generation device can also be advantageously based on an electromagnetic operating principle. In this solution, the movable cutting tool carrier is pressed against the fixed one due to a variable magnetic force. Since the magnetic force changes with increasing distance between armature and yoke, a balance of forces can also be achieved in an electromagnetic system during the grinding process between the cutting tools. The grinder can also be designed in different ways, therefore advantageously as a disc or cone grinder. The force generation device can have at least one pressure spring corresponding to the above designs, wherein the grinding gap extends over a plane E and wherein the pressure spring exerts an axial force perpendicularly to the plane E on the first and/or second grinding tool. Several springs, especially pressure springs, can be provided. These can be arranged symmetrically around the axis of rotation, which is formed by the rotating grinding tool, to achieve an optimally distributed application of force. A coil spring may be used as a pressure spring for the present application. However, springs or spring assemblies of other types can also be used. The force generation device may have a device for setting a pretensioning force of the spring, in particular of the pressure spring, in particular in the form of a servomotor. This servomotor is preferably an actuator which is controlled and/or regulated by a control and/or evaluation unit. The setting of the servomotor can be adjusted depending on a) the coffee beans, in particular the type of beans and their degree of roasting; b) the temperature of the grinder; and/or c) a degree of wear of the grinder. For example, the type of coffee beans can be predetermined by manual adjustment or determined by the power of the motor driving the grinder or the grinding tools. In this case, the determined power is compared with a data record stored on the control and/or evaluation unit within the scope of an actual value/target value comparison with regard to the power depending on the force to be applied to achieve a certain grinding degree or with regard to a bean type depending on the force to be applied to achieve a certain grinding degree. According to a further embodiment, it may be provided that when using a spring, the corresponding force-displacement characteristic curve is also specified as a data record, so that a specific adaptation of the spring force can be carried out by an actuator depending on the determined force to be applied. In the same way, the temperature of the grinder or the degree of wear (number of grinding processes) can be determined and the force to be applied can be adjusted accordingly by a target value/actual value comparison. It is also possible to combine the different sizes within the scope of a weighting, e.g. number of grinding processes with weighting according to bean type, in order to depict a more precise wear behavior. The grinder can optionally be equipped with a temperature sensor to determine the thermal expansion of the grinder and to control the force generation device to adjust the grinding degree. A method according to the invention for grinding coffee beans for the preparation of a caffeine-containing hot beverage, in particular by means of a grinder according to the invention, may comprise at least the following steps: a) Picking up of coffee beans in a grinding gap between two grinding tools; b) Applying an adjustable process force to at least one of the two grinding tools in the direction of the respective other grinding tool by a force generation device: and c) Output of the ground coffee or the ground product with a defined grinding degree. It is advantageous to adjust the magnitude of the process force depending on the type of coffee beans, the power of the grinder motor, the temperature of the grinder and/or the previous grinding passes. When adjusting the magnitude of the process force, a desired degree of fineness of the ground product can also be considered. Corresponding data records according to degree of fineness or grinding degree can be stored on the control and/or evaluation unit. During the grinding process, the cutting of the beans generates a force with which the cutting tools (grinding discs) are pressed apart. The stronger the force applied by the process force or counteracting force generation device, the finer the grinding degree. If there are no more beans, the disc-like grinding tools are clamped against each other with the contact pressure. Since the grinding tools are usually designed in such a way that they cannot get caught in each other, the grinder cannot fail. However, in the event of an empty bean container, grinding noise and damage to the flat surface of the grinding discs could occur. In addition, undesirable heat effects can occur, which can have a negative effect on the quality of the coffee grinding. With cone grinders, the cutting tools could even block. To solve this problem, it may be advantageously provided for the grinder to have a stop, in particular an adjustable stop, to set a minimum grinding degree. In this respect, it can be provided in particular that the axially movable tool part or the corresponding grinding tool is pressed against a stop. This end stop is adjustable before the grinder is put into operation and at the same time defines the minimum grinding degree to be produced. When force is applied, ideally there should only be a minimum gap between the cutting tools. If a greater contact pressure is subsequently specified than the process force during the grinding process, a ground product is produced with the fineness of this grinding disc gap. In practice, the touching point (beginning of audible grinding noises) of grinding disc grinders is an indicator of the zero point of the grinder. However, this is highly dependent on the axial run-out of the grinding discs and the individual hearing sensation of the grinder fitter. A suitable objective adjustment of the zero point can be carried out e.g. by an optional device to detect a certain electrical continuity of the lower and upper disc (electrical conductivity measurement). In conventional batches of grinders, grinding beans with respect to this reference point would still cause differences in the fineness distribution because the accuracy of the gap is directly related to the axial run-out tolerances of the discs. However, the use of this zero point definition for a force-controlled setting of the grinding degree has considerable advantages, because the subsequent fineness adjustment is only force-dependent and the stop is only used to prevent the touching point from being exceeded. Furthermore, such a construction leads to the avoidance of too finely adjusted grinders and overloading of the drive. A grinding degree that is too fine can lead to undesired long extraction times, in particular when producing filter coffee. Finally, this can also compensate for manufacturing tolerances in the design of the grinder. In terms of design, an end stop can be realized by means of a threaded adapter of one of the grinding disc carriers. Eventually, the carrier can be rotated up to the touching point of the cutting tools and then be fixed in this position. Thus, a minimum fineness level can be designed to be adjustable so that the cutting tools cannot grind on each other. The method according to the invention can also be further optimized by appropriate options. Therefore, it may be provided that a blockage of the cutting tools caused by impurities in the beans (pieces of wood, stones) can be released by removing the application of force. This is a simple and effective solution to the problem of cutting tool blockage. The grinder can be designed as a disc or roller or cone grinder according to advantageous embodiments. In one embodiment of the method it is provided that the adjustment of the magnitude of the process force is controlled by a control loop, wherein the control loop comprises the control and/or evaluation unit and at least one force measuring device having at least one force sensor. This has the advantage of enabling direct regulation of the grinder with regard to particle fineness. For this purpose, the grinder has in a further embodiment at least one force measuring device having at least one force sensor, wherein the at least one force sensor is directly or indirectly connected to the grinding tool. Such a force sensor can be a low-cost, high-quality component available on the market. For this purpose, different embodiments such as hydraulic pressure sensors, load cells, etc. are suitable. Another embodiment is designed in such a way that the at least one force sensor is connected to the control and/or evaluation unit and forms a measuring device of a control loop, which has the control and/or evaluation unit. The control and/or evaluation unit can have a computer, the programming of which can be extended by one or more control programs. This results in the following advantages: compensation of thermal expansion effects; quick initial adjustment of a grinder (in particular when changing the grinding tool); fineness adjustment during bean change; and direct regulation of the grinder with regard to particle fineness. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the following, the invention is described in more detail with reference to the drawings by means of an exemplary embodiment. The figures only serve to explain the invention in more detail and are not restrictive for the invention. Individual features described can also be transferred to further embodiment variants within the scope of general technical knowledge, wherein: FIG. 1 : is a schematic front view in section of an embodiment of a grinder according to the invention for grinding coffee beans: FIG. 2 : is a diagram showing the results of a series of grinding tests: FIG. 3 : is another diagram showing the results of a series of grinding tests: FIG. 4 : is a schematic front view in section of an embodiment of a grinder according to the invention for grinding coffee beans; and FIG. 5 : is the front view of the grinder according to FIG. 1 with a force sensor device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a schematic front view in section of the device according to the invention, in the form of a grinder 1 for grinding coffee beans 5 . Grinder 1 has a first grinding tool 2 . The first grinding tool 2 is non-rotatably mounted in a housing not shown here. In this respect, the first grinding tool 2 is at a standstill during operation of grinder 1 . The first grinding tool 2 is designed here as a grinding disc and therefore has a cylindrical envelope geometry and a central opening 3 . The grinding tool 2 can also be designed differently, e.g. as a grinding cone. The opening 3 can be penetrated by a feed hopper 4 . Coffee beans 5 to be ground are fed to the device 1 through the feed hopper 4 and the opening 3 . The grinder 1 can also be provided for grinding other semi-luxury foods or foodstuffs but is preferably intended for grinding coffee beans 5 . The feed hopper 4 is advantageously designed to prevent undesirable bridge formation of the coffee beans 5 in the feed hopper 4 . The first grinding tool 2 has a conical recess 6 on its side facing away from the feed hopper 4 . The recess 6 has at least one grinding edge 7 . The grinder 1 has a second grinding tool 8 . The second grinding tool 8 is arranged coaxially to the first grinding tool 2 and below the first grinding tool 2 . The term “below” refers to the drawing plane of FIG. 1 . The second grinding tool 8 is rotatably mounted in a housing not shown here. In this respect, the second grinding tool 8 rotates during operation of grinding tool 1 . The second grinding tool 8 also has a cylindrical envelope geometry. The second grinding tool 8 can also be designed differently, e.g. as a grinding cone. The second grinding tool is rotatable relative to the first grinding tool. In this case, the second grinding tool 8 is non-rotatably connected to a drive shaft 9 of a motor 10 so that the second grinding tool 8 is set in rotation while the first grinding tool 2 stands still. This is advantageous, but not mandatory. Alternatively, the first grinding tool can be rotatable or rotated during operation while the second grinding tool 8 stands still. It is also possible that both grinding tools can be rotated, e.g. in opposite directions of rotation and/or at different speeds, so that there is always a relative movement between the two grinding tools 2 , 8 . Alternatively, a shaftless direct drive is also possible, in which one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is the rotor of the motor 10 , or an indirect drive, in which the motor 10 acts upon one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 via a transmission. The second grinding tool 8 has a conical recess 11 on its side facing away from the motor 10 . The recess 11 has at least one grinding edge 12 . The conical recess 6 of the first grinding tool 2 and the conical recess 11 of the second grinding tool 8 thus form a kind of double conical grinding chamber 13 , which opens at its outer circumference into a grinding gap 14 . A collecting device (not shown here) can be connected to the grinding gap 14 , which collects the coffee beans, preferably coffee powder, emerging from the grinding gap 14 and feeds the powder into an extraction process. The grinder 1 has at least one force generation device 15 . In this case, the force generation device 15 acts upon the first grinding tool 2 , which means that a respective force F acts continuously, i.e. during operation while one or both grinding tools are rotating, upon coffee beans located between the first grinding tool 2 and the second grinding tool 8 . This is advantageous, but not mandatory. The force generation device 15 can also act upon the second rotatable grinding tool 8 or upon both grinding tools 2 , 8 . Here, the force generation device 15 comprises two pressure springs 16 , which can be pretensioned by a corresponding device 17 , for example by a servomotor, by a variable pretension path X, so that the respective force F, which acts upon the first grinding disc 2 and thus, during operation upon the coffee beans, can be changed or adjusted in its amount. The force generation device 15 can also be designed differently than shown in FIG. 1 . In this case, the force effect is essential, wherein the amount of force F is preferably variable or adjustable. In this case, the force generation device 15 can also be designed in such a way that the amount of force F is controlled automatically and/or infinitely variable depending on the higher-level operating parameters of a coffee machine. This makes it advantageously possible to carry out a defined presetting of a grinding degree C., since the force F correlates with the grinding degree C., i.e. the size distribution of the ground product particles, characterized by the particle size of the 50% median of the ground coffee, which will be explained below. In addition, the force acting upon the coffee beans by the grinder 1 can be set advantageously by the force generation device, depending on the coffee beans 5 to be ground and the desired grinding degree C. Preferably, data records regarding the grinding degree C. and the bean type and the force to be generated by the force generation device are stored on a data memory of a control and/or evaluation unit 18 for controlling a coffee machine and in particular the grinder 1 . The aforementioned control and/or evaluation unit 18 can be assigned to the grinder 1 or be part of a coffee machine, e.g. a fully automatic coffee machine. A setting of the grinding degree C. can thus be adjusted to match the specific bean (e.g. hard/heavily roasted beans vs. less heavily roasted café crème beans). See also FIG. 3 in this respect. Alternatively, the type of beans can also be determined by the difference in power of the grinding efficiency by means of which the motor 10 is operated. Furthermore, the force-controlled adjustment of the grinding degree C. allows a permanent reproducibility of the grinding degree C. even in case of grinding tool wear. For this purpose, a characteristic curve for wear over time can be stored for each bean type. The number of grinding processes can be weighted differently depending on the bean type used. Thus, for example, after 100 grinding processes of a “hard” bean type, a readjustment can be made by means of the device 17 . Likewise, the force-controlled setting of the grinding degree C. can be used advantageously to compensate for thermal expansion effects, in particular of the grinding tools 2 and 8 . For this purpose, a temperature sensor 23 (see FIG. 5 ) can detect the heat of the coffee beans as they leave the grinder 1 , represented by the double arrow—dashed line between the arrow at the output of the grinder and the temperature sensor 23 , which has an output leading to the control and/or evaluation unit 18 which, taking into account the coefficients of thermal expansion of the material of the grinding tools, accordingly adjusts the force of the force generation device 15 , in particular the pretensioning force of the pressure springs 16 . Furthermore, manufacturing inaccuracies of the grinding tools 2 , 8 , such as axial run-out tolerances of the grinding tools 2 , 8 have a significantly lower disturbing influence on the “grinding degree zero setting” of grinder 1 than in other grinding devices. Consequently, there are advantageously lower fluctuations of a grinding efficiency O of the grinder 1 and the generated grinding degree C. during operation of the grinder 1 . The grinder 1 described here opens up the possibility of changing the grinding degree C. of coffee beans, including espresso beans, in a force-controlled manner via the force generation device 15 . The inventive idea is based on a relationship between the force F acting upon the grinding tools 2 , 8 and the resulting distribution of the particle size of the coffee beans. The narrower the grinding gap 14 is, the finer is the ground product produced and the greater the reaction force with negative sign −F with which the grinding tools 2 , 8 are pressed apart. In embodiments according to the prior art, this force is absorbed by the grinding housing via the upper grinding tool. The relationship between a fixed geometry of the grinding tools 2 , 8 and the resulting relationship between the amount of force and the grinding degree C. can be determined empirically (see FIG. 2 ). The knowledge gained from this can be used to permanently and precisely adjust the grinding degree C. of the device 1 . If the magnitudes of the forces are known, they can be specified in certain gradations in order to produce a specific grinding degree C. (see also FIG. 3 ). FIG. 3 shows the results of a grinding test series. In this case, the upper grinding disc 2 was subjected to different forces F and then three grinds were performed with the Bacio Nero bean. The coffee powder was then measured with a particle measuring device (measurement based on laser diffraction). The different grinding samples correspond to the three characteristic curves fineness measurement 1 - 3 , wherein the median of the fineness distribution (grinding degree C.) is used as characteristic in each case. At the same time the grinding efficiency O of the device 1 was noted, i.e. the output grinding quantity of the device 1 per second. The device 1 was controlled by the motor 10 with power supply 230V, 50 Hz for 5 s each. FIG. 3 considers the influence of the amount of force F on the grinding degree C. and the grinding efficiency O when grinding different beans. The bean types Bacio Nero, La Tazza Verde (Melitta) and a reference type were ground. In this case again, grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C. were recorded at different amounts of force F acting upon the grinding tools 2 , 8 . Experiments have therefore shown that there is a good correlation between grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C. of a bean, provided that the production accuracy of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is within a certain tolerance (see FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 ). From the grinding efficiency O of different grinders, it is therefore possible to draw conclusions about the produced grinding degree C. with a high degree of accuracy, provided that the behavior of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is known. Under these conditions, a bean-specific force F can be inferred, with which a desired particle size distribution or a desired grinding degree C. can be achieved. With the help of a database, in which the behavior of a reference roast and reference bean is stored, a control of the force F can then be performed in order to set the desired particle size distribution or the desired grinding degree C. for the current roast and bean. As soon as the grinding efficiency O changes to a corresponding force F, because another bean or roast is used or the batch of a roast or bean type can be ground differently, the system regulates independently by a factor that depends on the grinding degree. This means that the force F is adjusted in order to obtain a desired particle size distribution or a desired grinding degree C. Furthermore, for presetting a fully automatic coffee machine, a grinder-specific determination of the relationship between grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C. is conceivable. In this way, increased accuracy can be generated for a specific grinder and the roast or bean type to be ground in it, in order to set a required grinding degree C. at a specified amount of force F. The grinding efficiency O of device 1 can be determined by means of already known methods: An indirect possibility is to use a cake height of the coffee powder in the extraction process at a given contact pressure to infer the weight of the coffee powder provided for the extraction process. A piston coffee machine offers this possibility due to the already existing brewing unit. Since the control time of the grinder is specified, the grinding efficiency O can then be inferred. A direct possibility is to weigh out the coffee powder. This can be automated by grinding in a set drawer and controlling it with a load cell. Another possible application of a force-controlled setting of the grinding degree C. is the combination of the device 1 with a regulation of the contact time between brewing water and coffee powder. To produce a constant beverage quality with a constant proportion of dissolved flavorings, a constant quantity of coffee powder with identical grinding degree C. must be passed through by a specified amount of water within a certain time. Other basic conditions such as water temperature, contact pressure and brewing pressure must also remain as constant as possible during the brewing process so that the swelling behavior of the coffee is comparable and the contact time between the brewing water and the coffee powder remains identical. A further embodiment of the grinder 1 is shown in FIG. 4 which, in comparison to FIG. 1 , shows a rolling element 19 arranged between the grinding tool 2 and the pressure springs 16 . It can also be a rolling bearing, e.g. a ball bearing or a needle bearing with a rolling element cage, wherein the pressure spring rests on the rolling element cage. This can extend coaxially to the feed hopper 4 . The rolling element bearing allows rotation of the grinding tool 2 without the connection point of the respective pressure spring rotating with it. This means that force can also be applied to a rotating tool element and, for example, force can also be applied to both tool elements. FIG. 5 shows the front view of the grinder according to the invention and FIG. 1 with the addition of one or more force sensor devices 20 arranged in cooperation with one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 . In this case, two sensor devices 20 are shown. A first force sensor 21 is in interaction with the grinding tool 8 at a standstill, whereas a second force sensor 22 is in interaction with the first grinding tool 2 . Each force sensor 21 , 22 can be directly or indirectly connected to the corresponding grinding tool 2 , 8 . The force sensors 21 , 22 can, for example, be a pressure sensor (e.g. a load cell or a hydraulic pressure sensor), which respectively records the force during a grinding process by direct or indirect measurement. Each force measuring device 20 is connected to the control and/or evaluation unit 18 , as shown by the arrows in FIG. 5 , and forms a measuring device of a control loop. The control and/or evaluation unit 18 has at least one target value/actual value comparator and a manipulated variable generator, which is coupled to an electrical fineness adjustment of the grinder 1 , which is not shown, but can easily be imagined. Since the axial force/fineness ratio of different beans in a grinder can be determined empirically, the grinder 1 is able to electrically set/adjust desired grinding degrees and to regulate them against disturbing factors (temperature, bean change, grinding disc exchange) with this control loop. This results in the following advantages: 1. compensation of thermal expansion effects; 2. quick initial adjustment of a grinder (in particular when changing the grinding tool); 3. fineness adjustment during bean change; and 4. direct regulation of the grinder 1 with regard to particle fineness (see indirect regulation via extraction time of the coffee cake).","12082743"

The person skilled in the art knows fully automatic coffee machines, which produce various coffee variants according to the espresso method, i.e. under pressure. Furthermore, there have long been conventional machines for the production of filter coffee. Due to the comparatively slow and low-pressure brewing process, a coffee with a very balanced taste and aroma is achieved. In conventional espresso production, the aroma is released quickly. The brewing process, which is usually less than 30 seconds for a cup of coffee in a fully automatic coffee machine, releases more essential oils and aromas due to the pressure of about 7.5-9 bar, but less caffeine, tannins and bitter substances due to the short brewing time. There are enthusiasts for both types of coffee. DE 42 40 175 C1 discloses a brewing unit with an automatically operating coffee machine. The choice of coffee production is made by the brewing position of the brewing plunger. Café Crème is made by coffee pressing, whereas filter coffee is made without coffee pressing. A similar setting between cream coffee and filter coffee is made in DE 33 16 157 A1. EP 0 909 542 A1 discloses a coffee machine for selectively brewing a filter coffee and an espresso coffee. U.S. Pat. No. 6,513,419 B2 and WO 2007/060 694 A1 each disclose a coffee machine for preparing various types of coffee, including filter coffee. These aforementioned documents do not disclose any division of the brewing process of the filter coffee into several brewing phases. A balanced extraction of the respective flavors can therefore not be achieved. DE 20 2016 008 296 U1 is cited as further prior art, but this does not relate to the production of filter coffee. DE 10 2018 116 306 A1 discloses various characteristics of a filter coffee as distinguished from other types of coffee, such as espresso. A preparation of filter coffee with several brewing phases is not disclosed, rather in this case admixing of coffee powder takes place parallel to the brewing process, wherein the amount of water/volume flow can be constant or preferably variable and preferably also monitored once or continuously. The invention is therefore based on the object of operating a fully automatic coffee machine in such a way that a coffee with a taste comparable to filter coffee is provided. The invention solves the problem by an operating method having the features of claim 1 and by providing a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention. A method according to the invention for producing a coffee beverage with a filter coffee flavor is carried out by a fully automatic coffee machine. The fully automatic coffee machine comprises at least one brewing unit having a brewing chamber and a plunger which is movable, in particular linearly displaceable, in the brewing chamber for adjusting a volume of this brewing chamber of the brewing unit. Such fully automatic coffee machines are known per se, but are not usually used for making filter coffee, but for making espresso or espresso-based beverages. The plunger is moved mechanically by an actuator, e.g. motorized or hydraulic, which adjusts the brewing chamber volume. The method according to the invention is characterized by the following steps of: a. filling the brewing chamber with ground coffee; and b. feeding water into the brewing chamber for the purpose of extraction in the course of a brewing process. In this case, at least the plunger is arranged during at least one brewing phase of the brewing process in a position in which the brewing chamber volume is greater than the volume of the ground coffee in a loosely filled state in the brewing chamber after the filling according to step a has taken place. This loosely filled state refers to the poured volume that occurs when an amount of ground coffee corresponding to the amount of ground coffee in the brewing chamber from step a is present in an uncompacted state. In the first position of the plunger, the volume of the brewing chamber is expanded in such a way that a suspension of ground coffee and water can be present, in which the ground coffee can be deposited at the bottom of the brewing chamber and/or floating in the suspension. The ground coffee may be present in a substantially uncompacted manner in the loosely filled state at the start of step b. This essentially means that a small amount of compaction of the ground coffee for the purpose of bringing it into form is possible. Typically, a loosely filled state has a conical shape. However, the bringing into form into a cylindrical shape can be carried out without mechanically compressing the volume of ground coffee to a greater extent. In contrast, a non-mechanical compression and/or compaction of a coffee ground fill, i.e., a compression or compaction without a mechanical force acting from the outside, is inherent to the brewing process due to the swelling of the ground coffee. The ground coffee can be compacted somewhat after filling and in particular before the brewing process. In a preferred embodiment, however, the ground coffee is essentially uncompacted. This means that the ground coffee is compacted by less than 15% by volume, in particular less than 10% by volume, compared to a loosely filled state, i.e. as a loose pile. This infinitesimal compression can take place in the course of shaping the ground coffee, for example to give the ground coffee a basic cylindrical shape in which extraction takes place more uniformly than in the case of a conical shape typical of loosely filling. The water can then flow through the ground coffee during the at least one brewing phase without a mechanical pressing force being exerted on the ground coffee that further compresses it compared to the loosely filled state. Due to the swelling of the ground coffee, however, compaction can still occur without an external mechanical contact force being exerted on the ground coffee for this purpose. In particular, water supplied in step b can flow through the ground coffee essentially without the application of a pressing force. The plunger can thus be moved or set to a second position in which it shapes the ground coffee, preferably before the brewing process. This makes it possible to achieve uniform distribution within the brewing chamber as a function of the amount of ground coffee. Furthermore, and also optionally, the plunger can be maximally retracted in the first position, whereby the volume of the brewing chamber is maximally expanded. Individual brewing phases can be carried out in this maximally extended position. There may also be an air space between the suspension and the front surface of the plunger. However, the said first position does not necessarily have to represent the maximum extended state either, but can also be lower. In addition to the main brewing phase, further brewing phases can also be provided. Preparatory or post-processing steps such as coffee grinding or subsequent cleaning, e.g. by CIP (clean in place), can also be part of the method according to the invention. In this case, parts do not have to be dismantled during CIP cleaning and cleaning can be carried out within the fully automatic machine by automatic processes. The method makes it possible to implement filter coffee production in a fully automatic coffee machine in an uncomplicated manner. The free water volume enables, among other things, sponging of the ground coffee. In addition, the ground coffee can be flowed around more easily in an uncompacted state. For a balanced extraction of the respective flavors, it is advantageous if the brewing process comprises several brewing phases in which water is passed through the ground coffee at different flow rates in relation to the brewing phases. According to the invention, the change between the brewing phases is preferably performed by measuring instruments detecting and/or determining a physical variable, in particular the conductivity, the refractive index and/or the quantity of ground coffee and/or water supplied and/or the quantity or volume of coffee removed or discharged. This allows the maximum amount of flavor substances to be extracted. In this context, coffee is a natural product whose flavor substances can vary depending on the area of cultivation, roasting process, storage, etc. The preferred variant is a water-volume-controlled change as a function of the output quantity, taking into account the amount of ground coffee. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are the subject matter of the subclaims. As previously described, the plunger can remain in a first position during the brewing process, which is also described below as the rest position. Preferably, the brewing chamber volume at the beginning of step b can be at least 50% larger, preferably twice as large, as the volume of the ground coffee in the loosely filled, in particular uncompacted, state. Furthermore, preferably and advantageously, the brewing chamber is constructed in such a way that at the beginning of step b only the ground coffee is arranged inside the brewing chamber. In fact, the free volume of the brewing chamber, which is filled with hot water in step b, adjoins the ground coffee. It is particularly advantageous in this context if the brewing process is a) a first brewing phase with a second flow rate and b) has a second brewing phase with a first flow rate and/or preferably a third brewing phase with a third flow rate, wherein the second flow rate may be less than the first flow rate and/or the third flow rate. Advantageously, the brewing process is divided into at least 2, preferably 3, brewing phases, each of which can be assigned one of at least 2, preferably 3, different flow rates. For example, the aforementioned second brewing phase can be designed as the main brewing phase. Furthermore, the first brewing phase can be designed as the pre-brewing phase and the third brewing phase as the post-brewing phase. However, this division or temporal sequence is not mandatory. Thus, the said second brewing phase can also be the first or the last brewing phase of the brewing process at the same time. These process phases advantageously run one after the other, and particularly preferably immediately one after the other. In this context, the second flow rate is preferably smaller than the third flow rate, which in turn is preferably smaller than the first flow rate. The flow rate for at least one brewing phase of the brewing process may be comparatively slow and less than or equal to 10 ml/s, preferably 2-5 ml/s. Preferably, the flow rate for at least the second brewing phase of the brewing process can be 2-5 ml/s. Also preferably, the flow rate for at least the first brewing phase of the brewing process may be 5-10 ml/s. In addition, the flow rate for at least the third brewing phase of the brewing process may be 10-15 ml/s. The fully automatic coffee machine may further comprise a coffee grinder, wherein the method comprises grinding coffee beans to a predefined size for filter coffee. As is known, the grinding degree for filter coffee is coarser than the grinding degree for espresso coffee. Therefore, it is advantageous if the operating parameters of the coffee grinder are automatically set to an optimum grinding degree for filter coffee by the automatic coffee machine when the beverage request or selection “filter coffee” is made by the user. The grinding degree can be determined according to DIN 44 539. DIN 44 539 defines three gradations for classifying the grinding degree. Grain sizes are defined which must account for a proportion of more than 50% of the ground material, in this case ground coffee. The value x 50,3 indicates in the measurement report that 50% of the grind distribution is coarser and 50% is finer than the indicated measured value. The determination of the individual grain size fractions is carried out using the air jet sieve method according to DIN 10 765. The aforementioned regulations refer to the current version at the time of priority of the present invention. “Fine” Grinding Degree All grain sizes up to a maximum of 0.25 mm result in a proportion of more than 50%. “Medium” Grinding Degree The grain size between 0.25 mm and 0.71 mm result in a proportion of more than 50%. “Coarse” Grinding Degree All grain sizes larger than 0.71 mm result in a proportion of more than 50%. For the present method, a “medium” grinding degree or, particularly preferably, a “coarse” grinding degree is recommended. It is recommended that the plunger brings the coffee powder into shape before the brewing process, so that the volume of the brewing chamber is reduced during the shaping process and for its purpose. The plunger is retracted again after the first bringing into shape and thus does not rest on the ground coffee. This creates a large brewing chamber in which there is more space for the ground coffee to swell when it comes into contact with water. At the same time, non-compacted ground coffee has a lower flow resistance. With this method of operation, one can assume an uncompacted flow behavior. When making conventional filter coffee in a coffee filter, on the other hand, the coffee powder often has to settle first, which takes additional time. Furthermore, it is advantageous if the plunger is retracted before the brewing process so that the volume of the brewing chamber expands again, preferably by at least 100% compared to the volume in the shaped state, so that slow extraction and low-pressure passage of the water is possible. It is advantageous if the plunger remains in a rest position during the entire brewing process. The plunger can also be moved during pre-brewing and/or post-brewing. At least during a brewing phase, a slow extraction is recommended. In addition, the fully automatic coffee machine may have a filter, e.g., a sieve and, in particular, a CIP-capable permanent filter. A change in the brewing phases can be made in particular by detecting a conductivity and/or a refractive index, with a measuring sensor for detection being arranged downstream of the brewing unit in terms of flow, so that the measurement result of the finished coffee, i.e. the end product, is taken as the basis for the change. Alternatively and preferably, the measuring sensor can also be arranged in front of the brewing unit in order to influence the properties while the coffee is still being prepared. Particularly preferably, a change in the brewing phases can be set by detecting a supplied amount of water, taking into account the supplied amount of ground coffee. The supplied amount of ground coffee can be taken into account, for example, as part of an adjustment of the grinding capacity. The grinding capacity in mg/s at a preset grinding degree can be adjusted to the amount of water for a specific volume of filter coffee at the customer's request. Furthermore, the brewing pressure during the brewing process is preferably less than 2.5 bar. Preferably, the brewing chamber is closed except for an outlet for coffee during the brewing process. Optionally, an inlet for hot water can also be open. Preferably, the flow rate is adjusted in steps during the brewing process to change between two brewing phases. Preferably, the change between all further brewing phases of the brewing process can also be adjusted in steps. The fully automatic coffee machine can also have a bypass line starting from a hot water boiler to a dispensing unit with one or more control elements, wherein a dispensing of hot water takes place, preferably simultaneously with the brewing process and/or the dispensing of coffee from the brewing unit, to achieve a predetermined coffee volume. One or more valves can be used as control elements. Each valve defines a different flow rate. According to the invention, there is also a fully automatic coffee machine comprising at least one brewing unit with a linearly displaceable plunger for setting a volume of a brewing chamber of the brewing unit and a control and/or evaluation unit which is set up to carry out a method according to the invention. The fully automatic coffee maker can advantageously have a hot water boiler, wherein a flow rate limiter for setting a flow rate is arranged between the hot water boiler and the brewing unit. This enables the flow rate to be set after the respective first, second and/or third brewing phase and/or possibly further optional brewing phases. The flow rate limiter can have a plurality of control elements, e.g. valves, which are designed for stepped adjustment of the flow rate to ensure a brewing process with several brewing phases with different flow rates. A stepped adjustment allows a very direct setting of a desired flow rate, whereas a stepless adjustment often allows a less optimal dosing due to an overrun that is difficult to detect. In the following, the invention is explained in more detail by reference to an exemplary embodiment of a method according to the invention with the aid of the following figures, wherein: FIG. 1 a shows a schematic structure of a first variant of a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention; FIG. 1 b shows a schematic structure of a second variant of a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention; FIG. 1 c shows a schematic structure of a third variant of a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention; FIGS. 2 a - g show detailed views of a brewing unit of the fully automatic coffee machine with a plunger in different operating positions during execution of the method according to the invention; FIG. 3 shows a measurement of various physical quantities as a function of the course of the brewing process when carrying out the method according to the invention; FIG. 4 shows a measurement diagram of an exemplary coffee extraction, e.g. on the basis of a conductivity, over a brewing process with several brewing phases according to a first embodiment variant of the method according to the invention; and FIG. 5 shows a measurement diagram of an exemplary coffee extraction, e.g. on the basis of a conductivity, over a brewing process with several brewing phases according to a second embodiment variant of the method according to the invention. FIG. 1 shows the basic structure of a fully automatic coffee machine 1 according to the invention. The fully automatic coffee machine 1 has a brewing unit 2 and a hot water boiler 3 as central units. For the supply of water, the fully automatic coffee machine has a water inlet 4 . This can be, for example, a removable water reservoir or a connection to a water pipe. Furthermore, the automatic coffee machine 1 has a water pump 5 for conveying the supplied water into the hot water boiler 3 . In addition, the fully automatic coffee machine 1 has a measuring device for determining the flow rate 6 . In the present exemplary embodiment, this is arranged upstream of the hot water boiler 3 in terms of flow and enables the water feed quantity into the boiler to be controlled at this position. Alternatively or additionally, an analog measuring device for flow rate determination can also be arranged between the hot water boiler 3 and the brewing unit 2 and/or downstream of the brewing unit 2 in terms of flow. The measuring device for determining the flow rate 6 can advantageously be designed as an impeller meter. Furthermore, the supply line upstream of the hot water boiler 3 has a rebound valve 7 . The hot water boiler 3 then heats the supplied water to a temperature of preferably 80-96° C. Within this temperature range, the water temperature can be variably adjusted according to the desired hot beverage. Furthermore, the fully automatic coffee machine can have a non-displayed line for adding cold water in order to achieve a product-specific setting of the brewing temperature. The water heated in this way is then fed to the brewing unit 2 , preferably in metered quantities. If the water boiler 3 or alternatively also the brewing unit 2 has not already implemented a metering device, a flow rate limiter 8 can be provided between the water boiler 3 and the brewing unit 2 for more precise metering of the flow rates of hot water required in the respective method steps. The flow rate limiter of FIG. 1 a enables a stepped adjustment, in particular a stepped control, of the flow rate of the hot water supplied to the brewing unit 2 . For this purpose, three brewing valves 8 a - 8 c are provided in each case in FIG. 1 a , wherein each of the brewing valves can have a different cross-section and consequently represents a different flow rate into the brewing unit. Preferably, one brewing valve is open in each case, while the other two brewing valves are closed. In the variant of FIG. 1 b , the flow rate limiter 8 is implemented by two brewing valves 8 a and 8 b . Here, too, at least three flow rates can be set in total, by opening each of the individual brewing valves 8 a or 8 b or by simultaneously opening both valves 8 a and 8 b . Preferably, in the variant of FIG. 1 b , the cross-sections and thus flow rates downstream of the valve are continuously adjustable, e.g., manually adjusted needle valves. Thus a stepless flow rate adjustment of an otherwise step-set supply of a water quantity is possible. FIG. 1 c discloses a variant in which a stepless valve 8 d is used to adjust the flow rate. However, a stepwise change of the flow rates is preferred in order to enable a direct and fast regulation. Furthermore, for redundancy reasons, in the case of the stepped variant, in the event of failure of a valve, emergency operation can still be ensured for coffee withdrawal with reduced selection options. In addition, the stepped setting of FIGS. 8 a and 8 b enables fast feeding and discharging with clear or unambiguous switching states. While a pressure limiter is often provided at this point in espresso machines, a flow rate limiter, e.g. a throttle, preferably a variably controllable throttle, is preferred here. Alternatively, the functions of a pressure limiter and a flow rate limiter can also be implemented together in one control element, so that the fully automatic coffee machine can be used in a more versatile way, i.e. for the production of more coffee variants. The brewing unit 2 preferably has a brewing chamber 12 whose volume can be adjusted by a linearly movable plunger 11 . The plunger position is variably adjustable. Furthermore, the brewing unit 2 has a filter 15 , preferably a permanent filter. The permanent filter is preferably CIP-capable. The permanent filter may in particular be a microfine sieve. Particularly preferably, the sieve may have at least 30,000 holes, preferably at least 40,000 holes, per 1.*10 3 mm. The brewing unit can be filled with ground coffee by manual filling, i.e. by direct insertion of the ground coffee, e.g. via a feed chute, or by grinding whole beans immediately before feeding them into the brewing unit. For this purpose, the fully automatic coffee machine may have a non-displayed coffee grinder. Since ground coffee for filter coffee usually has a coarser grinding degree than espresso powder, it is advantageous if the integrated coffee grinder is equipped to produce a variable grinding degree. This is matched to the type of coffee and the type of filter, in particular the permanent filter. Corresponding parameters are, for example, the degree of fineness or the distribution. Further details of a coffee grinder with a variable grinding degree can be found in DIN 44539 (in the current version at the time of the present application), which is referenced in the context of the present application. The grinding degree can be variably adjusted, for example, by varying the grinding time, speed, pressure of the grinding elements and/or roughness of the grinding elements. In addition or as an alternative to the flow rate limiter 8 , the fully automatic coffee machine 1 can have a measuring sensor 9 , in particular a physical measuring sensor for determining a coffee property. This is preferably arranged downstream of the brewing unit 2 in terms of flow. This coffee property can preferably be the conductivity, the refractive index, the pressure and/or the temperature. A variant of the measurement in this context is described in detail, inter alia, in DE 10 2018 116 306 A1, to which reference is hereby made. Alternatively and particularly preferably, the measuring sensor can also determine a volumetric flow of coffee leaving the brewing unit. Finally, the coffee is forwarded to a dispensing unit 10 . In addition, the fully automatic coffee machine 1 may have further blocking and/or diverting valves at various positions. In particular, the fully automatic coffee machine has a bypass line 17 between the hot water boiler 3 and the dispensing unit 10 for supplying hot water to the dispensing unit without this having previously been passed through the brewing unit 2 . In particular, the bypass line 17 enables a reduction of the coffee preparation time due to a parallel supply of hot water to the coffee. In particular, it may be that hardly any flavoring substances are extracted in a post-brewing phase, so that the preparation time is shortened to the desired volume by the supply of hot water. In this case, no bitter substances are supplied via the bypass line 17 , as can be the case with longer extraction times in the brewing unit. Nevertheless, the desired volume can be maintained. The hot water can be supplied to the dispensing unit by several predefined supply rates, wherein control elements 16 , e.g. bypass valves 16 a and 16 b , are provided for setting a flow rate. Preferably, the flow rate and the supply volume can be made in dependence on the values determined by the measuring sensor 9 or in dependence on the flow rates. The operation of the brewing unit 2 and/or the hot water boiler 3 is controlled by a control and/or evaluation unit 13 . The control and/or evaluation unit preferably has a computing unit and a data memory on which one or more data records or databases are stored, which are called up when the method according to the invention is carried out. The method according to the invention for producing a coffee beverage with the characteristics of a filter coffee is carried out according to several steps. In this process, the brewing unit 2 designed as a plunger unit and other core components of the fully automatic coffee machine are used for fully automatic filter coffee production. A previously defined quantity of ground coffee is fed into the brewing chamber 12 and hot water is passed through it, at a low volume flow, with the plunger retracted. The coffee extracted under these conditions has the characteristic features of freshly brewed filter coffee. Investigations have shown that the coffee beverage produced has a directly comparable result to filter coffee production, e.g. in a glass filter. In the following, the method according to the invention is described in detail on the basis of an embodiment variant. In a first step, a user enters a beverage request. The beverage request can be transmitted electronically, e.g. via a cell phone app, or by triggering a control element, e.g. a control panel or a button on the fully automatic coffee machine. Then, in a second optional step, coffee beans are ground to an optimum size for filter coffee by the coffee grinder. In machines with a plurality of storage tanks, e.g. for espresso beans or coffee beans, there is also the option of selecting the type of bean to be fed to the coffee grinder. Alternatively, ground coffee can be fed to the brewing unit by direct insertion—before or after the first step. In a third step FIGS. 2 a - 2 c , the brewing chamber 12 of the fully automatic coffee machine 1 is filled, e.g. by opening a slide 14 , cf. FIGS. 2 a and 2 b , the brewing chamber 12 is opened and ground coffee, cf. FIGS. 2 b and 2 c , is fed in. In FIG. 2 c , the ground coffee is then in the form of a cone. In a fourth step, shown in FIG. 2 c , the brewing chamber is then closed, e.g. by operating the slide 14 , and the brewing chamber 12 is sealed. The plunger 11 of the brewing unit 2 can be operated briefly, depending on the amount of ground coffee, to bring the ground coffee into shape. This is shown in FIG. 2 d . Here, the ground coffee is only slightly compressed, but merely shaped cylindrically in order to achieve a more uniform extraction. The plunger is then returned to its original position to increase the volume of the brewing chamber. Next, the brewing chamber 12 is widened to introduce water so that there is room for the ground coffee to swell upon contact with water. This can be seen in FIGS. 2 d and 2 e. In a fifth step, hot water is supplied at a first flow rate. This is referred to below as the first brewing phase, e.g. in a pre-brewing phase. This involves partial and rapid filling of the brewing chamber. To ensure a phase transition of the aroma substances, a certain holding time can optionally be provided. Preferably, the flow rate during pre-brewing is between 9-12 ml/s. After the rapid feed in the pre-brewing phase, a holding time can be provided in which the flow rate is reduced but the brew valve(s) remain open. This can preferably be at least 3 seconds. Then, in a sixth step, hot water is supplied again in a second brewing phase at a second flow rate. This can be the main brewing phase, for example. Hot water is supplied slowly, preferably at a flow rate of less than 5 ml/s, particularly preferably less than 3 ml/s. Uniform extraction is achieved by the slow flow rate, in which soluble substances are also entrained. At the end of the sixth step, the mass transfer of a large part of the aroma substances into the water is complete. The duration of the brewing phase can be controlled as a function of time, quantity (volume or mass of water supplied), pressure and/or, particularly preferably, conductivity. Finally, in a seventh step, the flow rate is increased again, e.g. to 5-10 ml/s. The terms flow rate or volumetric flow rate are to be understood synonymously in the context of the present application. This third flow rate corresponds to the third brewing phase, which may be the so-called post-brewing phase. This phase is preferred to obtain a balanced extraction result. Finally, in an eighth step, the ground coffee is ejected from the brewing chamber. During the individual brewing phases, the brewing chamber can remain open on the drain side, so that the coffee is dispensed into a coffee cup after each phase, i.e. during preparation. The coffee in the brewing chamber can be fed to the output as required, by closing the plunger. The pressure of 4 bar, or in particular 2.5 bar, is preferably not exceeded during all brewing phases of coffee production. On the contrary, the coffee preparation can be carried out particularly preferably without additional pressure from the plunger 11 during the brewing phases. The phase transition between the different brewing phases can occur as a function of the following physical variables and can vary depending on both the amount of ground coffee and the total amount of water: a) Time-controlled by means of a data set value or by a preset after time x [s] has elapsed. This variant varies in particular with the amount of coffee, the volume of water and/or the desired coffee volume. b) Quantity-controlled by means of a data set value or by a presetting according to/at quantity x [ml]. c) Conductivity-controlled by means of a data set value or by a presetting after falling below a proportion of measured conductivities of substances during the brewing process [mS/cm]. In this variant, it is possible to determine in particular when the proportion of conductive substances has been extracted for the most part. The volumetric flow of warm or hot water during the respective brewing phases can be regulated or controlled and can vary depending on both the amount of ground coffee and the total amount of water. The preparation is preferably carried out “cup by cup”, storage e.g. in an internal hot holder of the fully automatic coffee machine before dispensing is conceivable. The entrainment of large particles (coll. or similar crumbs) from the ground coffee into the beverage is preferably prevented by the use of the filter. The brewing chamber volume can be variably changed automatically, preferably before brewing, and adjusted to the desired output volume of the coffee. Preferably, the brewing pressure can be determined upstream and/or downstream of the brewing chamber 12 for measurement data collection. A specific preparation sequence is given below as one embodiment. Brewing Phases I. 0-8 s [80 ml] Pre-brewing II. 8-40 s [70 ml] Brewing III. 40-70 s [150 ml] Post-brewing Parameter Amount: 300 ml Duration: 70 s Amount weighed: 10 g Conductivity: 2.45 mS/cm (Ø) Brewing pressure: 0.5 bar Brewing temperature: 92° C. The measurement diagrams in FIG. 3 were created under these conditions. In the pre-brewing phase I, a pressure increase can be seen due to the rapid supply of water, wherein a low pressure can be built up by plunger 11 . During the main brewing phase II, it can be seen from the increase in conductivity (FIG. 3 b ) that a large proportion of ingredients are transferred during this phase. The flow rate (FIG. 3 c ) is significantly lower than in the pre-brewing phase I. As can be seen from the pressure curve, the main brewing phase takes place without any significant pressure build-up (FIG. 3 a ). This pressure increases again in post-brewing phase III. The flow speed is also increased. The conductivity is low compared to the main brewing phase and continues to decrease in the course. FIG. 4 shows a first variant in which a brewing process runs in three different brewing phases I, II, III. The volumetric flows Q Brewing a, b and c and thus also the first, second and third flow rates vary depending on the brewing phase. Based on the conductivity, the extraction of flavors can be traced. It can be seen that only a few flavors are extracted, particularly in the third brewing phase III. Preferred flow rates or volumetric flows for the individual brewing phases of FIG. 4 but also for other process variants are as follows: First flow rate: Q Brewing a: 2-5 ml/s Second flow rate: Q Brewing b: 5-10 ml/s Third flow rate: Q Brewing C: 10-15 ml/s FIG. 5 shows an alternative second variant of a method according to the invention in which two brewing phases I and II with identical volumetric flows Q Brewing a are passed through the brewing chamber and in which a third brewing phase III with a different volume flow Q Brewing c is operated simultaneously with a volumetric flow of hot water via a bypass line Q Bypass a. The third brewing phase III is used to extract residual coffee and possibly also some bitter substances. In this third brewing phase III, in addition to residual extraction, optionally also of some bitter substances, the main aim is to achieve a desired volume of coffee. As can be seen from FIG. 5 , the method according to the invention does not necessarily have to include three brewing phases with three different volume flows or flow rates, but it is possible to do so and thereby achieve a more balanced taste. The bypass volume flow Q Bypass b can be switched on, for example, in the second brewing phase II or at the end of the brewing process after completion of the third brewing phase III.

Coffee may be brewed both at home and commercially by various methods including dripped and percolated. Dripped coffee may be favored, especially in commercial settings, because of preferable flavor, ease of preparation, or other reasons. In the dripped method, ground coffee may be placed in a coffee filter and the filter placed in a coffee holder. In some coffee brewers, the coffee holder may be constructed to function as both the holder and filter. For example, the coffee holder may have a fine mesh sieve at the bottom that retains the ground coffee but permits passage of liquids. Hot water is released at a predetermined rate onto ground coffee and the coffee chemicals carried from the ground coffee by the hot water, which then seeps through the coffee filter and is directed into a coffee vessel for immediate use or storage for later use. The ground coffee may comprise a blend of two or more varieties of coffee beans. The coffee beans may be selected to provide a desired resultant brewed coffee having certain characteristics, for example, a balance of types of flavors and acidity. The strength of the brewed coffee may depend upon the length of time that the hot water is in contact with the ground coffee and the quantity of ground coffee available to provide the coffee flavoring chemicals. The rate at which water is released onto the ground coffee may be adjusted so that the hot water remains in the coffee holder long enough to brew the coffee before seeping through the filter and into the coffee vessel. The quantity of coffee in the holder may also be a factor in the length of time that the water remains in the holder. The holder flow-through rate and the water release rate are balanced so as to prepare a consistent strength of brewed coffee for a given amount of ground coffee. SUMMARY The present application describes systems and techniques relating to brewing coffee. In one aspect, brewing of coffee is facilitated by releasing water from at least one water inlet onto ground coffee in a stationary coffee filter. The ground coffee is automatically agitated while the water is being released using an agitator that is connected to an agitator motor. The agitation (or stirring) during the brewing process can promote flavor-enhancement of the coffee by helping to assure that the coffee grounds are uniformly mixed, saturated and blended with hot water. The agitation may substantially maintain an evenness of depth of the ground coffee, further aiding in the flavor-extraction process. The water extracts coffee chemicals and is collected after it has contacted the ground coffee. The release of water may be automatically stopped after a predetermined amount of water has been released onto the ground coffee. The automatic agitating of the ground coffee may be stopped a predetermined amount of time after the water has stopped being released. In another aspect, an apparatus includes a retention vessel to receive an aqueous liquid; a stationary ground coffee holder removably coupled to the retention vessel and having a bottom effective to retain ground coffee and permit passage of aqueous liquid; at least one water inlet to provide water to be released onto the ground coffee; an agitator motor; and a coffee agitator connected to the agitator motor effective to agitate the coffee grounds during the brewing process to aid flavor-enhancement of the brewed coffee by helping to assure that the coffee grounds are uniformly mixed, saturated and blended with hot water. Also, the agitation substantially maintains the evenness of the depth of the ground coffee when the agitator motor is operating. The apparatus may have a heating element in heating communication with the retention vessel. The heating element also may be arranged to heat water that is subsequently provided to the water inlets. Control elements may be included to control at least one of the (a) amount of water released, (b) the temperature of the released water or (c) the operation of the agitator motor. The coffee agitator may have protrusions to extend into the ground coffee when the apparatus is in operation. The protrusions may have a circular cross-sectional shape and may also be flared on the free end. The protrusions may have an elliptical cross-sectional shape. The systems and techniques described here may provide one or more of the following advantages. In some implementations, the method can provide for uniform wetting of the ground coffee during brewing to enhance flavor production in the brewed coffee. The device can stir the coffee grounds during brewing without substantially disturbing the evenness of depth of the ground coffee in the coffee holder. A consistent brew of coffee may be achieved helping to assure that the water released onto the ground coffee contacts the ground coffee for a consistent amount of time to extract coffee chemicals before being collected. Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages may be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

A coffee maker includes an agitator to stir coffee grounds as water passes through the grounds. A motor is coupled to the agitator to move the agitator when water is released onto the coffee grounds. When in operation, the coffee grounds are in a stationary coffee holder below the agitator, which allows the aqueous liquid to pass through the holder and collect in a retention vessel. FIG. 1 illustrates an implementation of a coffee brewer 100 having a stationary ground coffee holder 102 and a coffee agitator 104 . The coffee holder 102 may be arranged as a filter to retain ground coffee 110 (shown as dots) and allow an aqueous liquid to pass through at least the bottom of the holder. In another implementation, the ground coffee holder may have one or more holes in the bottom. In this case, the ground coffee may be in a filter (not shown) within the ground coffee holder 102 that permits an aqueous liquid to pass through the filter into the ground coffee holder and then through the holes in the holder. The filter may be permanent, disposable or reusable. An agitator drive shaft 106 couples the coffee agitator 104 to an agitator motor 108 . In an implementation, a bushing 114 may be used to provide a bearing surface for the agitator drive shaft 106 . In some implementations, the bushing may be of a synthetic material or any other suitable material. The bushing may be made of, or coated with, a self-lubricating material. In implementations where the shaft is sealed, a lubricating port may be provided to enable lubrication of the shaft 106 without permitting the lubricant to contaminate the ground coffee. At least one inlet port 112 can be arranged to allow a fluid to be released onto the ground coffee. In an implementation, two or more inlet ports may be used. One or more valves (not shown) may be provided to enable or inhibit the release of fluid onto the ground coffee. A retention vessel 116 may be fitted with a support 118 to support the ground coffee holder 102 in the retention vessel. In an implementation, the coffee holder 102 is removably connected to the support 118 . The coffee holder also may be arranged to act as a filter that retains the ground coffee but allows fluid to pass through. The retention vessel 116 may be situated to receive the aqueous liquid after the liquid has contacted the ground coffee. In some implementations, a discharge spout 120 may be coupled to the retention vessel 116 . The discharge spout can be used to dispense the aqueous liquid from the retention vessel 116 . A discharge valve 122 may be provided to enable or inhibit the flow of the aqueous liquid through the discharge spout 120 . A heating element 124 may be in heating communication with the retention vessel 116 . The heat from the heating element also may be used to heat a liquid that may be supplied through piping (not shown) to the inlet ports 112 . Hot water may be released from the inlet ports 112 onto the ground coffee 110 that is put in the fixed ground coffee retainer 102 . In an implementation, the hot water supplied to the inlet ports 112 may be maintained at a temperature typically between about 180 and about 205 degrees Fahrenheit (82 and 96 degrees Celsius), preferably at approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) measured at the outlet of the inlet port 112 . The hot water may pass through the ground coffee and the coffee holder 102 and collect in the retention vessel 116 . While the water is being released from the inlet ports 112 , the agitator motor 108 may be activated to cause the coffee agitator 104 to rotate. The coffee agitator 104 may be arranged so that, when used, it helps to maintain the evenness of the ground coffee depth. Maintaining the evenness of depth of the ground coffee may help to provide consistency of the resultant brewed coffee by tending to cause the hot water to steep in the ground coffee for a consistent amount of time. That is, the hot water may steep longer in the ground coffee if the water is released onto an area where the depth of the ground coffee is deeper than in an area where the depth of the ground coffee is shallower. Such disparities could result when the ground coffee accumulates, or piles up, in front of a moving coffee agitator. The coffee agitator is located above the bottom of the coffee holder and is arranged so that the protrusions extend downwardly below the surface of the ground coffee when ground coffee is in the coffee holder. In one implementation, the motor may be controlled so as to rotate the coffee agitator in both a clockwise and a counter-clockwise direction. By rotating the coffee agitator in both directions, accumulation of the ground coffee 110 ahead of the agitator may be lessened. The rotational speed of the motor also may be adjusted to help reduce the accumulation, or piling up, of ground coffee ahead of the coffee agitator. Ground coffee is often a blend of a variety of coffee beans. The particular beans selected may be chosen to achieve a desired combination of, for example, flavors, strength and acidity. The consistency of the resultant brewed coffee may depend on extracting the coffee flavors in the proportions desired. It is advantageous to assure that the grounds of all the selected beans are wetted equally and uniformly, for example, by forming a slurry. As the released water seeps through the ground coffee and the water level in the ground coffee holder decreases, some of the grounds may be above the surface of the water and not providing their flavor to the brew. Also, some of the wet grounds may tend to sink to the bottom of the coffee/water slurry. The coffee agitator, when in use, may be arranged to help evenly and uniformly distribute the various ground coffee varieties in the coffee slurry. In one implementation, the coffee agitator may be arranged to have protrusions or other surface features that stir the ground coffee without disproportionately affecting the ground coffee depth. FIGS. 2-6 illustrate examples of coffee agitators. FIG. 2A illustrates a coffee agitator 202 having substantially cylindrical protrusions 204 that depend from a coffee agitator support surface 206 . FIG. 2B view A-A illustrates the substantially circular cross-sectional shape of the protrusions 204 . The length of the protrusions 204 may be selected to extend into the ground coffee in the coffee holder. The protrusions 204 may have a number and arrangement so as to stir the ground coffee without substantially disturbing the depth of the ground coffee. FIG. 3A illustrates a coffee agitator 300 having stirring protrusions 310 of a substantially elliptical shape. FIG. 3B view B-B illustrates the substantially elliptical cross-sectional shape having a central axis 320 of the protrusions 310 . Again, the number and arrangement of the protrusions may be such to stir the ground coffee without substantially disturbing the depth of the ground coffee. The protrusions may be positioned at an angle on the agitator to achieve different degrees of agitation. FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the agitator of FIG. 3B-B where the elliptical protrusions 310 are rotated about the central axis 320 of the elliptical protrusions. The rotation can result in a variation in agitation of the ground coffee as the coffee agitator is rotated because a different projected surface area is presented to the ground coffee. FIG. 5A illustrates a coffee agitator 500 having protrusions 514 , which have a profile that may tend to stir the ground coffee so as to bring grounds from the bottom of the coffee towards the top. FIG. 5B view C-C illustrates the substantially circular cross-sectional shape of the protrusions 514 , which are flared on a bottom end 518 . The protrusions 514 are wider at the bottom end 518 than at the fixed end 516 so as to cause the ground coffee at the bottom of the coffee holder to be stirred upwards. FIG. 7 illustrates a coffee agitator 600 having protrusions 604 of varying lengths so as to generally conform to a shape of a coffee holder 702 . The differing lengths can provide for agitation of the coffee grounds 110 close to the sidewalls 704 of the coffee holder. In the example illustrated, the coffee holder 702 has sidewalls 704 that are inclined with respect to the coffee holder bottom 706 . The inclined sidewalls 704 can help prevent the coffee grounds from sticking to the sidewalls as the water level in the coffee holder decreases. FIGS. 6A-6B illustrate an implementation of the coffee agitator 600 of FIG. 7. Protrusions 604 may be attached to a protrusion support 602 . In an implementation, the support can be a bar. Other shapes may be used. The protrusions 604 may be attached at an angle θ to an x-axis of an orthogonal x-y axis in the plane of agitator rotation. The angle θ is selected to agitate the coffee grounds in both the x and y directions and, in one implementation, is 15 degrees. The protrusions 604 a - 604 n can be of any suitable number and of varying lengths generally to follow the shape of the coffee holder. The ends 606 of the protrusions may be shaped including tapered, flat and pointed. Referring again to FIG. 1, after the water progresses through the ground coffee, the liquid may pass through the ground coffee holder 102 and collect in the retention vessel 116 . In an implementation, the collected liquid may be dispensed through the discharge spout 120 . Liquid remaining in the retention vessel 116 may be kept at a predetermined temperature by the heating element 124 . In an implementation, liquid may be circulated in piping (not shown) around the heating element so as to heat the liquid. Subsequently, the heated liquid may be provided to the inlet ports 112 . In an implementation, control circuitry 126 may be used to vary operation of the coffee brewer. For example, the control circuitry may be coupled to the agitator motor 108 to limit the operation of the agitator motor and, hence, the coffee agitator 104 . For example, the control circuitry may provide that the agitator motor continue to operate for a predetermined time after the liquid has ceased to be released from the inlet ports 112 . Thus, the ground coffee 110 continues to be agitated while some part of the liquid remains in the ground coffee holder 102 . The control circuitry also may be coupled to the inlet port 112 to limit the amount of water released onto the ground coffee or control the temperature of the released water. FIG. 8 is a flow chart 800 of an implementation of a method for making stir-brewed coffee. Hot water may be released 802 from water inlets onto ground coffee. The inlets may be arranged to evenly distribute the water onto the ground coffee. The hot water may be heated externally or heated by a heating element that also can serve to heat the brewed coffee. The hot water can seep through the ground coffee and extract the coffee chemicals while in contact with the ground coffee to provide stir-brewed coffee. The amount of water in contact with the ground coffee may depend upon at least the rate of water release and the flow-through rate through the ground coffee. The water and ground coffee can create a slurry that may be agitated 804 . Agitation of the slurry may help to assure a uniformity of the mixture of various varieties of coffee (for example, beans, crops, roasts, and so on) that make up the ground coffee so that each variety contributes in desired proportion to the resultant brewed coffee. The agitation of the slurry can be implemented so as to involve the coffee varieties in the desired proportions. The agitation of the coffee grounds also may be implemented so that substantially all of the water that is released onto the grounds remains in the slurry for substantially the same amount of time and, thus, extracts substantially the same amount of coffee chemicals. The brewed coffee may be collected 806 in a suitable vessel after the added water seeps through the ground coffee. Other embodiments may be within the scope of the following claims.","20050008744"

BACKGROUND ART In general, in order to improve an extraction rate of coffee component included in the roasted coffee beans (which herein includes: a flavor component providing elements of taste, aroma, and color specific to coffee; a richness component providing elements of richness and thickness of coffee; and the like), a water vapor treatment is performed in which the roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with water vapor. However, this treatment increases an acidity of the roasted coffee beans, and thus it is likely that an excessive acidity is added to a coffee beverage obtained through an extraction from the roasted coffee beans. Accordingly, as described in Patent Document 1, there had been proposed a method for treating roasted coffee beans in which generation of acidity in the roasted coffee beans can be suppressed, even when the water vapor treatment is performed on the roasted coffee beans for the purpose of improving the extraction rate of the coffee component. Patent Document 1: International Publication WO2005/011396 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to the treatment method described in Patent Document 1, it is possible to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component while suppressing the generation of acidity in the roasted coffee beans. However, the method does not necessarily promote a satisfactory increase in the content of richness component (which herein means a component that provides elements of richness and thickness of coffee, and examples include oligosaccharide and succinic acid) in the roasted coffee beans (for example, in the case of the roasted coffee beans of Coffea robusta or the like, the method does not satisfactorily increase the content of richness component). It should be noted that, with respect to trials to increase the richness component content of the roasted coffee beans, there have been made various studies (e.g., elaborating the roasting method) for increasing the richness component content in the roasted coffee beans that have not so high commercial values due to their low richness component content (e.g., C. robusta ), but no satisfactory effect has been obtained to this date. The present invention was made with the view towards overcoming the above-mentioned disadvantages, and the purpose is to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component from the roasted coffee beans while suppressing the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans, and to increase the richness component content in the roasted coffee beans. In a first aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the method includes: a sugar-enriching treatment step in which roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with sugar to increase a sugar content of the roasted coffee beans; and a water vapor treatment step in which the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are brought into contact with water vapor. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, as shown in Examples 3-8 which will be described later, it becomes possible to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component from the roasted coffee beans while suppressing the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans. In addition, as will be described later in Examples 3-8, in the roasted coffee beans treated according to the present invention, it is possible to remarkably increase a content of succinic acid (one of richness component) which is taken as richness index in rice wine or the like. Therefore, according to the present invention, the richness component content in the roasted coffee beans can be increased. It should be noted that it is the present inventors' intensive and extensive studies that led for the first time to the finding of the above-described fact, i.e., the above-described effects can be obtained by combining the sugar-enriching treatment step in which roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with sugar to increase a sugar content of the roasted coffee beans, and the water vapor treatment step in which the roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with water vapor. In a second aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the roasted coffee beans are roasted whole beans. [Action and Effect] According to the invention, the roasted coffee beans are roasted whole beans, and thus in water vapor treatment step the drainage of the flavor component and the richness component of coffee can be suppressed low, leading to enhancement of use efficiency of the roasted coffee beans as raw material. In a third aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the sugar is selected from the group consisting of sucrose, glucose and maltose. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, sucrose, glucose, and maltose which are industrially available at low cost are used, and thus the richness component can be effectively given to the roasted coffee beans, such as C. robusta. In a fourth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the sugar-enriching treatment comprises a treatment of bringing the roasted coffee beans into contact with a sugar solution. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with the sugar solution, and thus the sugar component can be efficiently transferred into the roasted coffee beans through the medium. In a fifth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the sugar solution is an aqueous solution. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, water, which has a high solubility of sugar, is used as medium, and thus a sugar solution of a high concentration can be prepared, leading to efficient transfer of the sugar component into the roasted coffee beans. In a sixth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the roasted coffee beans are those of Coffea robusta. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the richness component content of the C. robusta can be remarkably increased, leading to enhancement of commercial value of C. robusta. In a seventh aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, in the water vapor treatment step, the water vapor is brought into contact in a ventilated state. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the contents of formic acid and acetic acid in the roasted coffee beans can be reduced, leading to secure suppression of the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans. In an eighth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, in the water vapor treatment step, the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are placed in a processing tank equipped with a water vapor supply pathway and a water vapor effluent pathway, and the water vapor is passed from the water vapor supply pathway to the water vapor effluent pathway so as to be discharged from the water vapor effluent pathway at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, by performing the water vapor treatment in a ventilated state, it becomes possible to eliminate formic acid and acetic acid generated by a pyrolysis reaction from the system, and thus the acidity of the treated roasted coffee beans is expected to be reduced. In a ninth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, in the water vapor treatment step, the water vapor is brought into contact in a sealed state. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the water vapor treatment is performed in a sealed state, and thus the richness component can be given without draining the aroma component from the roasted coffee beans. In a tenth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the water vapor is saturated water vapor whose temperature is 100° C.-230° C. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the water vapor temperature is set to 100° C.-230° C., and thus the richness component, such as succinic acid, can be produced efficiently. In a first aspect of the roasted coffee bean according to the present invention, the roasted coffee bean is treated by the above-mentioned method for treating roasted coffee beans. [Action and Effect] The roasted coffee beans of the present invention have a very high commercial value, with a high extraction rate of the coffee component, a low acidity, and a high content of the richness component. In a second aspect of the roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, a succinic acid content is 0.69 mg/g or more. [Action and Effect] The roasted coffee beans of the present invention have a very high commercial value, with a high content of succinic acid as richness component. In an aspect of the coffee beverage according to the present invention, it is made from the above-mentioned roasted coffee beans. [Action and Effect] The coffee beverage of the present invention has an excellent flavor with a low acidity but with deep richness and thickness. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The embodiments of the present invention will be described below. Embodiments Prior to describing the method for treating roasted coffee beans of the present invention, the roasted coffee beans and sugar used in the present invention will be described first. (Roasted Coffee Beans) There is no limitation with respect to the type of the roasted coffee beans to be used in the present invention, and examples include Coffea arabica, Coffea robusta , and Coffea liberica . It should be noted that, since the present invention is especially effective for roasted coffee beans having a small sugar content, C. robusta , such as vietnam and conilon, are preferably used. In addition, in order to prevent the coffee components (such as flavor component and richness component of coffee) from draining, which may otherwise be caused by a continuous water vapor treatment, it is desired that the roasted coffee beans is in whole bean form or coarsely ground. (Sugar) There is no limitation with respect to the sugar to be used in the present invention, but preferable examples include: monosaccharide, such as glucose, galactose, and fructose; and disaccharide, such as sucrose, maltose, lactose, and cellobiose. It is more preferable to use sucrose contained especially in natural coffee beans. Next, the method for treating roasted coffee beans of the present invention will be described below. The method for treating roasted coffee beans of the present invention includes at least (1) sugar-enriching treatment step and (2) water vapor treatment step, which will be described below. Steps other than these (e.g., a step in which the roasted coffee beans are washed with water and dried after the sugar-enriching treatment step) may be added when desired. (1) Sugar-Enriching Treatment Step The sugar-enriching treatment step is performed in which the roasted coffee beans and the sugar are brought into contact with each other to increase the sugar content of the roasted coffee beans. There is no limitation with respect to the method for bringing the roasted coffee beans into contact with the sugar, and for example, a sugar solution prepared by dissolving sugar in a solvent, such as water, to a predetermined concentration may be brought into contact with the roasted coffee beans in an appropriate manner. The sugar concentration of the sugar solution to be used is arbitrarily selected. However, in the case of a sugar solution of a low concentration, the coffee components are likely to be transferred to the solvent when a long-term contact is necessary, and thus it is preferable that the sugar concentration is at a level or higher that can prevent the transfer of the coffee components. On the other hand, in the case where the sugar concentration is excessively high, an operability of the treatment becomes poor, for example, a removal of the excessive sugar attached to the surface of the roasted coffee beans becomes difficult. The range thereof is preferably 10 wt %-50 wt %, more preferably 20 wt %-40 wt %, still more preferably 25 wt %-35 wt %. Examples of the method for brining the sugar solution into contact with the roasted coffee beans include spraying, application and immersion. Among these, immersion for a predetermined period of time (e.g., approximately 1 hour) is preferable, since the immersion allows the sugar to efficiently penetrate into the roasted coffee beans. (2) Water Vapor Treatment Step Next, the water vapor treatment is performed in which the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment and water vapor are brought into contact with each other. The present step can be performed, for example, by a non-ventilated (batch-wise) water vapor treatment in which the above-described roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are placed in a sealable pressure vessel, water vapor is supplied, and predetermined temperature and pressure are retained for a predetermined period of time. However, it is preferable that the present step be performed by a continuous water vapor treatment in which, for example, in the water vapor treatment step, the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are placed in a processing tank equipped with a water vapor supply pathway and a water vapor effluent pathway, and the water vapor is passed from the water vapor supply pathway to the water vapor effluent pathway so as to be discharged from the water vapor effluent pathway at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. This is because, in the continuous water vapor treatment, by supplying the water vapor in a ventilated state, it becomes possible to eliminate formic acid and acetic acid generated by a pyrolysis reaction from the system, and thus the acidity in the roasted coffee beans is expected to be reduced. There is no limitation with respect to the type of the water vapor to be used in the present step, and examples include saturated water vapor, superheated steam, and supersaturated water vapor. It is preferable that a quality of the water vapor is that of pure steam, which is vapor generated from pure water. However, the quality is not limited as long as water can be used for treating foods, and if desired, vapor may be generated from a mixture of water and an appropriate amount of alcohol added thereto. It should be noted that the water vapor should not have extremely high temperature or high pressure, in order to retain increment of succinic acid, to suppress generation of formic acid and acetic acid, and to suppress carbonization of coffee beans. Specifically, it is desirable that the treatment be performed at a temperature of 100° C.-230° C. For attaining this temperature condition, the pressure range is generally set to 0.1 MPa-1.7 MPa, through the temperature range varies depending on the type of water vapor. It is more preferable that the temperature range is approximately 165° C.-205° C., in which the extraction efficiency of the coffee component by the hydrothermal reaction treatment is enhanced. In order to attain this temperature condition, in the case of saturated water vapor, the pressure range is set to 0.7 MPa-1.3 MPa. It is further more preferable that the temperature range be 165° C.-190° C., in which the generation of acidity is suppressed. For attaining this temperature condition, in the case of saturated water vapor, the pressure range is set to 0.7 MPa-0.9 MPa. It should be noted that the term “pressure” herein means “gauge pressure” which is a pressure when the atmospheric pressure is 0. Accordingly, for example, when the “gauge pressure 0.1 MPa” is converted into absolute pressure, it is a pressure with a value of atmospheric pressure plus 0.1 MPa. With the use of the technique of the present invention, the succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans can be remarkably increased. For example, there can be obtained roasted coffee beans having the succinic acid content of 0.69 mg/g-2.5 mg/g, or 0.8 mg/g-2.0 mg/g or more. According to the present invention, as will be described later in Examples, it becomes possible to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component from the roasted coffee beans while suppressing the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans, and to increase the richness component content. Especially, by applying the present invention to the roasted coffee beans of C. robusta or the like that has less richness component and not so high commercial value, the commercial value thereof can be enhanced. It should be noted that the roasted coffee beans treated according to the present invention can be used as one of coffee materials for coffee beverage, together with other roasted coffee beans (regular coffee beans), instant coffee, and liquid coffee extract, and that such a coffee beverage can be produced in a coffee beverage manufacturing plant by a common method. For example, in a case of production process of coffee beverage cans, the coffee beverage can be produced by performing steps of “grinding (regular coffee beans and the roasted coffee beans)”, “extraction”, “blending”, “filtration”, “filling”, “seaming”, “sterilization”, “cooling”, and “box packing”. Alternatively, instant coffee, liquid coffee extract or the like may be prepared from the roasted coffee beans treated according to the present invention. EXAMPLES Hereinbelow, the present invention will be specifically described by referring to Examples, but the present invention is not limited to Examples. Example 1 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. arabica Water vapor treatment step: continuous water vapor treatment (treatment conditions: temperature=175° C., 190° C., 200° C.; time period=4 minutes) For the roasted coffee beans, those having a high degree of roast (L value=18, C. arabica ) in whole bean form were used. In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed 2.0 kg of roasted coffee beans and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor at a low pressure of 0.2 MPa (120° C.) was passed from the vapor inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. Three different treatment temperatures were used as standards (first treatment temperature: 175° C., second treatment temperature: 190° C., and third treatment temperature: 200° C.), and for each temperature, a water vapor treatment was performed for 4 minutes and then vacuum drying was performed. As a result, three different water vapor treated roasted coffee beans for these treatment temperatures were obtained (sample 1 (175° C.), sample 2 (190° C.), and sample 3 (200° C.)). With respect to each of the samples 1-3 and untreated roasted coffee beans, the coffee beans were ground (medium grinding), 10 g of the ground coffee was added to 100 mL of water retained at 90° C. under atmospheric pressure, an extraction was performed for 20 minutes, and paper filtration was performed to thereby obtain an extract. These extracts were evaluated in terms of pH, acid degree, content of dissolved solid (Brix) including the coffee components, and extraction rate. For the measurement of pH, a type F23pH meter (manufactured by HORIBA, Ltd.) was used. For the measurement of the acid degree, a titration acidity was measured using CAM500 (manufactured by Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) by a method based on JAS, and a value was expressed as an amount (relative value) of 0.1N NaOH required for titrating the extract up to pH7. For the measurement of Brix, RX-5000α (Atago Co., Ltd) was used, to whose measurement plate was dropwise added approximately 0.5 mL of the extract. The extraction rate was calculated based on the amount of the collected extract liquid (A), Brix (B), and the weight of the ground coffee beans (C), using the following equation: Extraction rate (%)= A (g)× B (%)/ C (g). A sensory evaluation was also performed, and with respect to each of the samples, the coffee beans were ground, 10 g of the ground coffee was put in a test glass, and 150 mL of boiled water was poured into the test glass to thereby obtain an extraction. First, a presence of off-flavor was checked while the coffee in the test glass was stirred well, and subsequently, tasting was performed with the coffee at an appropriate temperature (approximately 60° C.). There were six graders who performed the sensory evaluation (checking the presence of richness/thickness, acidity, and off-flavor). In the sensory evaluation, the richness/thickness was evaluated using a four-grade scale (1, 2, 3 and 4 points), in which a larger number means stronger and a smaller number means weaker. The acidity was evaluated using a four-grade scale, in which a larger number means weaker and a smaller number means stronger. An average of points given by the six trained graders was taken, and the scores of 3 points or more was marked as “O”, the score of 2-point range was marked as “Δ”, and the score of 1-point range was marked as “X”. The results are shown in Table 1 below. As compared with the untreated beans, the water vapor treated beans (samples 1-3) had a notably high extraction rate, while in terms of the treatment temperature, not so large difference was observed. With respect to the acidity, a sample (sample 3) was stronger than untreated beans, but the acidity can be suppressed to some degree when treated at 200° C. or lower. It should be noted that, with respect to all of the samples, the presence of the off-flavor was not sensed. Hereinafter, the water vapor treatment was performed at 190° C., since the excellent result was obtained in the sensory test. TABLE 1 Untreated Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 1 beans (175° C.) (190° C.)

The test was performed on the roasted coffee beans of C. arabica , and roasted coffee beans of two types of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam). For the sugar-enriching treatment step, 100 g of each of the roasted coffee beans was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. From each of the treated coffee beans, an extract was prepared (in Table 2, these extracts are referred to as “sample with sugar-enriching treatment”), and the sucrose concentration in the extract was measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). For the measurement, the areas of the peak were measured using aqueous solutions of sucrose of 10 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm to obtain a calibration curve. In a profile of each sample, an area of the peak for the same retention time as that of sucrose was obtained, to thereby calculate the concentration. It should be noted that, with respect to each of the above-described roasted coffee beans, roasted coffee beans on which the sugar-enriching treatment step was not performed were prepared, and the sucrose concentration was measured in the same manner (in Table 2, these extracts are referred to as “untreated sample”). The results are shown in Table 2. Since the sucrose concentration in the sample with sugar-enriching treatment was increased more as compared with the sucrose concentration in the untreated sample, it is considered that the sucrose content of the roasted coffee beans was increased in all samples by the sucrose immersion treatment, and a remarkable increase was observed especially in C. robusta . This result shows that the method can increase the sucrose content of the roasted coffee beans. TABLE 2 Sucrose concentration (ppm) Sample with sugar-enriching Untreated sample treatment C. arabica 92.9 98.1 C. robusta (conilon) 24.2 61.8 C. robusta (vietnam) 18.9 66.3 Example 3 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. robusta Sugar-enriching treatment step: immersing the roasted coffee beans in a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose Water vapor treatment step: continuous water vapor treatment (treatment conditions: temperature=190° C.; time period=4 minutes) With respect to C. robusta beans having the sucrose content increased by the sugar-enriching treatment, it was examined how a succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans changes when a water vapor treatment step (190° C.) is performed. The test was performed using the roasted coffee beans of two types of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam). For the sugar-enriching treatment step, 100 g of each of the roasted coffee beans was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose (prepared by dissolving 300 g of JIS special grade reagent (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) into 1,000 mL of ion-exchange water) at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to the coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed. In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed 2.0 kg of roasted coffee beans and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor (190° C., 0.9 MPa) was passed from the inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. From each type of the obtained roasted coffee beans, an extract was prepared (in Table 3, these extracts are referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”). In addition, the roasted coffee beans of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam) on which only the water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained from each type (in Table 3, these extracts are referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment”). Moreover, the roasted coffee beans of two types of C. robusta on which neither the sugar-enriching treatment step nor the water vapor treatment step was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained from each type (in Table 3, these extracts are referred to as “untreated sample”). Each extract as obtained above was subjected to filtration, and the succinic acid concentration was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). For the measurement, a single point calibration was performed using 200 ppm of a succinic acid standard solution, and the concentration was calculated based on peak areas for the same retention time. In addition, the succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans was calculated using the following equation: Succinic acid content in 1 g of roasted coffee beans=Succinic acid concentration (ppm)×Extract amount (L)/Weight (g) of roasted coffee beans The results are shown in Table 3 below. It was confirmed that the succinic acid content was remarkably increased by performing the water vapor treatment after the sucrose immersion treatment. This result shows that the method can remarkably increase the succinic acid content by performing the water vapor treatment on the roasted coffee beans whose sucrose content has been increased. TABLE 3 Succinic acid content (mg/g) Sample with water Untreated Sample with water vapor treatment + sample vapor treatment Sugar-enriching treatment Conilon 0.60 1.00 1.54 Vietnam 0.61 0.95 1.35 Next, with respect to the above-described two types of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam), sensory evaluation tests were performed on the extracts of “sample with water vapor treatment”, and “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”. In the sensory evaluation of the extract, the richness/thickness was evaluated using a four-grade scale (1, 2, 3 and 4 points), in which a larger number means stronger and a smaller number means weaker. The acidity was evaluated using a four-grade scale, in which a larger number means weaker and a smaller number means stronger. An average of points given by the six trained graders was taken, and the scores of 3 points or more was marked as “O”, the score of 2-point range was marked as “Δ”, and the score of 1-point range was marked as “X”. With respect to the off-flavor, the presence or absence of the off-flavor was indicated. The results are shown in Table 4 below. In all samples, no off-flavor was present and the acidity was hardly increased, while in the case where the sugar-enriching treatment step and the water vapor treatment step were performed, enhancement of richness/thickness was observed. TABLE 4 Sample with Sample with water vapor water vapor treatment + sugar- treatment enriching treatment Conilon Richness/Thickness Δ ◯ Acidity ◯ ◯ Off-flavor None None Vietnam Richness/Thickness Δ ◯ Acidity ◯ ◯ Off-flavor None None Example 4 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. arabica Sugar-enriching treatment step: immersing the roasted coffee beans in a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose Water vapor treatment step: continuous water vapor treatment (treatment conditions: temperature=190° C.; time period=4 minutes) In order to examine whether or not the same applies to C. arabica beans as it applies to C. robusta , a sugar-enriching treatment test was performed on C. arabica beans in the same manner as described above. In the same manner as in Example 2, for the sugar-enriching treatment step, 100 g of the roasted coffee beans of C. arabica was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose (prepared by dissolving 300 g of JIS special grade reagent (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) into 1,000 mL of ion-exchange water) at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to the roasted coffee beans of C. arabica having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed. In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed 2.0 kg of roasted coffee beans and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor (190° C., 0.9 MPa) was passed from the inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. From the obtained roasted coffee beans, an extract was prepared (in Table 5, the extract is referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”). In addition, the roasted coffee beans on which only the water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained therefrom (in Table 5, the extract is referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment”). Moreover, the roasted coffee beans on which neither the sugar-enriching treatment step nor water vapor treatment step was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained therefrom (in Table 5, the extract is referred to as “untreated sample”). Each extract as obtained above was subjected to filtration, and the succinic acid concentration was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). For the measurement, a single point calibration was performed using 200 ppm of a succinic acid standard solution, and the concentration was calculated based on peak areas for the same retention time. Next, in the same manner as in Example 3, the succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans was calculated. The results are shown in Table 5 below. It was confirmed that the succinic acid content was increased by performing the water vapor treatment after the sucrose immersion treatment. TABLE 5 Succinic acid content (mg/g) Sample with water Untreated Sample with water vapor treatment + sample vapor treatment sugar-enriching treatment C. arabica 0.60 1.69 1.73 Next, with respect to C. arabica , sensory evaluation tests were performed on the extracts of “sample with water vapor treatment”, and “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”. As the result of the sensory test, no off-flavor was present and the acidity was hardly increased, while enhancement of richness/thickness was observed. It was confirmed that by performing the sugar-enriching treatment step and the water vapor treatment step, the coffee has characteristic taste with a notable depth. Example 5 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. robusta (conilon, L value=23) Sugar-enriching treatment step: immersing the roasted coffee beans in a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose Water vapor treatment step: continuous water vapor treatment (treatment conditions; temperature=175° C., 190° C., 200° C., 230° C.; time period=4 minutes) As the roasted coffee beans, four samples (samples 4-7) each composed of 100 g of C. robusta (conilon, L value=23)) were prepared. For the sugar-enriching treatment step, each of the samples 4-7 was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose (prepared by dissolving 300 g of JIS special grade reagent (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) into 1,000 mL of ion-exchange water) at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to each of the samples 4-7 having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step was performed using a continuous water vapor treatment, with the treatment time period of 4 minutes and various treatment temperatures (sample 4: 175° C., sample 5: 190° C., sample 6: 200° C., and sample 7: 230° C.). In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed each samples 4-7 and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor was passed from the inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. For each of the obtained samples 4-7, an extract was prepared. In addition, the roasted coffee beans ( C. robusta (conilon, L value=23)) on which neither the sugar-enriching treatment step nor the water vapor treatment step was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained therefrom (in Table 6, the extract is referred to as “untreated sample”). With respect to each extract as obtained above, in the same manner as in Examples 1 and 3, pH, content of dissolved solid (Brix) including the coffee components, extraction rate, and succinic acid content were measured and sensory evaluation tests (richness/thickness, acidity, and off-flavor) were performed.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a grinder for grinding coffee beans, to a method for grinding coffee beans and to a coffee machine, in particular a fully automatic coffee machine. BACKGROUND The appropriate fineness of a coffee powder is a prerequisite for successful coffee preparation. It determines the speed at which the water can flow through the coffee powder and the time period during which aromas and flavors can be released from the coffee powder. This time is called extraction time and it is a quality criterion for the appropriate extraction of the flavors and aromas of the respective coffee beverage. The extraction intensity of a coffee beverage is decisively influenced by the grinding degree of the ground coffee, in addition to contact pressure, water temperature, water quality and bean properties. The grinding degree describes the fineness with which the bean is ground. The grinding process of coffee beans produces a fineness distribution, i.e. not all coffee particles have the same size but are subject to a particle size distribution typical for coffee. The median X50 [μm] of the fineness distribution is a proven measurement for assessing the fineness of the ground coffee. It denotes the value of the particle size that lies in the middle of the quantity distribution (e.g. an idealized ball diameter for measuring instruments with laser diffraction principle). This means that one half of all particles is smaller, and the other half is larger than the median. The finer a grind, the larger the total particle surface area and thus the contact time of the water with the coffee powder. A balanced ratio between aroma and strength is achieved when approximately 18 to 22% of the aromatic substances are dissolved from the coffee. The optimal contact time for espresso preparation is in the range of 25-30 s and for filter coffee several minutes. Under-extraction leads to a too acidic and over-extraction to a too bitter coffee taste. The appropriate grinding degree of espresso powder is at a median of maximum 350 μm, that of café creme at 550 μm and that of filter grinding at 700 μm. The grinding degree of the coffee powder can usually be adjusted in coffee machines with a grinder. High-quality machines even allow infinitely variable adjustment of the grinder and compensate for undesirable boundary conditions (e.g. thermal expansion, grinding disc wear, etc.) by readjusting the grinder components. Some systems use the extraction time of the coffee beverage as an indirect feature to check the appropriate setting of the grinding degree. For the preparation of a high-quality coffee beverage, the appropriate and product-related setting of the grinding degree plays a major role. Two main proven designs of coffee grinders are known which are used in coffee machines. On the one hand, disc grinders and on the other hand cone grinders. Both types of grinders have in common that they consist of two grinding tools, wherein one of these tools is fixed and the other is driven. As a result of the rotational movement of the one grinding tool, the beans are drawn into a grinding gap and are ground ever finer via the tapering grinding gap width. The smallest distance between the two grinding tools is decisive for the produced grinding degree of the coffee powder. To change the grinding degree, the fixed tool can be adjusted relative to the rotating tool so that the distance is varied. These systems are geometry-based methods for changing the grinding degree. According to the technical teachings of EP 2 286 699 B1, it is provided that the grinder for a coffee machine has a first grinding disc that can be driven about an axis of rotation by a drive means and a second grinding disc. The second grinding disc is fixed in a screw-in part which can be screwed into a housing and can be rotated relative to the housing by adjusting means. Thus, a grinding gap between the two grinding discs can be adjusted. The adjusting means are designed coaxially to the screw-in part, which interacts with an adjusting wheel that can be rotated by adjusting means. The grinder also has a feed opening for feeding the coffee beans to be ground and a discharge opening for discharging the coffee ground between the two grinding discs. For adjusting the grinding gap, the grinder has a central adjustment facility which is infinitely variable. An existing problem of these grinder systems is the determination of a zero point at which a minimum degree of fineness can be defined. Only if this is successful, a grinding degree suitable for the product can be set directly and precisely in relation to this zero point. A prerequisite for this is particularly high manufacturing accuracy in the overall design of the grinder (e.g. high axial run-out accuracy in the disc grinder). Furthermore, in conventional coffee grinders, disturbing influences such as thermal expansion of the grinder components, grinding disc wear, bean change, etc. can only be compensated indirectly (e.g. by evaluating the extraction time). Heat influences in particular lead to varying grinding degrees and different swelling behavior of the coffee powder in the brewing unit and are thus the main cause of fluctuating run-down times. As a result of these facts, long adjustment cycles are often required to ideally adjust the grinder of a coffee machine to the desired product and taste profile. Furthermore, the grinding degree can usually only be set and adjusted for a specific product. SUMMARY An object of the invention therefore is to further develop a generic grinder in a functionally advantageous manner. According to an embodiment of the invention, a grinder for grinding coffee beans comprises a first grinding tool and a second grinding tool forming a grinding gap, wherein the second grinding tool is rotatable or is rotated relative to the first grinding tool during operation of the grinder (i.e. during grinding of coffee beans), wherein the grinder has at least one force generation device for applying a force F, which is preferably also adjustable during operation, to the first grinding tool or the second grinding tool, which is transmitted to the coffee beans, wherein the force F is directed in such a way that it presses the respective grinding tool to which the force F is applied in the direction of the respective other grinding tool. The force can be applied during operation, but also when the grinding tools are at a standstill or not in operation. The grinder according to the invention serves or is designed for grinding coffee beans. It can be used as a stand-alone unit or integrated into a coffee machine, e.g. a fully automatic coffee machine. The grinder comprises a first grinding tool and a second grinding tool. The grinding tools form a grinding gap or define such a grinding gap from opposite sides. This grinding gap can be designed flat or increasingly towards the center, and preferably defines a plane, more preferably a plane of symmetry. The second grinding tool can be rotated relative to the first grinding tool, in particular rotatably driven by a drive unit such as a motor. The grinder also has at least one force generation device for applying a force F to the first grinding tool or second grinding tool, which is transmitted to the coffee beans to be ground. Thus, in addition to the weight of the grinding tools, a further force is added to the weight of the grinding tools, which can be adjusted during operation of the grinder and which is applied by the force generation device. In this process, the force F is directed in such a way that it presses the respective grinding tool to which the force F is applied, in particular axially in the direction of the respective other grinding tool. The force generation device thus presses the two grinding tools together and not, as is known from the prior art, away from each other. The application of force virtually replaces the support of the grinding tool on an abutment. With an adjustable force, a product-specific optimum grinding degree can be achieved that remains largely constant even under changed process conditions. It may be advantageously provided that a product-specific grinding degree is set by applying a force with an adjustable process force. In this respect, it can also be provided that when changing the type of coffee or the product type (e.g. from espresso to café crème), a product-specific setting of the grinding degree or changeover is automatically performed when the product is received from a fully automatic coffee machine in which the grinder is integrated. This setting of the grinding degree can be carried out extremely quickly with the invention, for example to change from a setting of the grinding degree for espresso to a setting of the grinding degree for café crème. Since the adjustment or changeover is very fast, a second grinder may even be unnecessary in a fully automatic coffee machine. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preparing coffee with a coffee machine, in particular with a fully automatic coffee machine, and with a grinder of the above type, in which coffee beans are ground with the grinder and in which coffee of a specific type is prepared in a brewing unit from the coffee beans and water. In one embodiment, the grinding degree is automatically adjusted or changed, depending on the type of coffee (for example espresso or café crème), before grinding, in the case of a change in the type of coffee, and further depending on the amount of water and the amount of ground coffee and optionally depending on additives such as milk. During operation of the grinder, one of the two grinding tools can be at a standstill and the second of the two grinding tools can be rotatably operated by a drive unit, e.g. a motor. However, both grinding tools can also rotate, in particular in opposite directions to each other. The force generation device can act upon both the first and second grinding tool, so that a more even distribution of force is achieved. However, in terms of design it is easier if the force generation device only acts upon one grinding tool, in particular the one at a standstill of the two grinding tools. Furthermore, a force generation device can also act upon the first grinding tool and upon the second grinding tool. In this case, according to one embodiment, it may be provided that the force generation device has at least one spring and a device for setting a pretensioning force of the spring, in particular in the form of a servomotor. This embodiment is particularly easy to implement in terms of design and is easily controllable and/or adjustable. It should generally be noted that it is not primarily important which of the grinding tools (also referred to as “cutting tools” in the following), driven or stationary grinding tool, has a degree of freedom in the direction of the process force and is actively subjected to a force in this direction. The force adjustment can be automatic (e.g. motorized) or manual (e.g. adjusting wheel). With motorized adjustment, a control loop is conceivable, wherein the grinding degree is changed if the last extraction times deviate from the target run-down time. The constructive implementation of a force control can be realized in different ways. One possibility is the compression of a mechanical spring by a certain distance x with known force-displacement characteristic curve. However, there are also other solutions for applying a defined force to one of the cutting tools. First of all, a pneumatic approach is conceivable here, wherein one grinding disc carrier can be actively pressed against the other with variable air pressure. A passive embodiment would be a gas pressure spring with a fixed force-displacement characteristic curve, wherein only a certain grinding degree would then be adjustable in the grinder. However, springs are also available with variable gas pressure. Alternatively, however, it may also be provided that the force generation direction is based on a fluid operating principle. Since the distance between the grinding tools or cutting tools in the disc grinder only has to change slightly up to 0.2 mm depending on the process force during grinding, hydraulic solutions with fluids of higher compression modules are also possible to control the force. Even then, the system would have a damping effect during grinding. A rubber diaphragm can be used to apply force, which is filled with water via an adjustable pressure reducer. A hydraulic water system is available in coffee machines anyway and could be used to regulate the grinding degree. Furthermore, the force generation device can also be advantageously based on an electromagnetic operating principle. In this solution, the movable cutting tool carrier is pressed against the fixed one due to a variable magnetic force. Since the magnetic force changes with increasing distance between armature and yoke, a balance of forces can also be achieved in an electromagnetic system during the grinding process between the cutting tools. The grinder can also be designed in different ways, therefore advantageously as a disc or cone grinder. The force generation device can have at least one pressure spring corresponding to the above designs, wherein the grinding gap extends over a plane E and wherein the pressure spring exerts an axial force perpendicularly to the plane E on the first and/or second grinding tool. Several springs, especially pressure springs, can be provided. These can be arranged symmetrically around the axis of rotation, which is formed by the rotating grinding tool, to achieve an optimally distributed application of force. A coil spring may be used as a pressure spring for the present application. However, springs or spring assemblies of other types can also be used. The force generation device may have a device for setting a pretensioning force of the spring, in particular of the pressure spring, in particular in the form of a servomotor. This servomotor is preferably an actuator which is controlled and/or regulated by a control and/or evaluation unit. The setting of the servomotor can be adjusted depending on a) the coffee beans, in particular the type of beans and their degree of roasting; b) the temperature of the grinder; and/or c) a degree of wear of the grinder. For example, the type of coffee beans can be predetermined by manual adjustment or determined by the power of the motor driving the grinder or the grinding tools. In this case, the determined power is compared with a data record stored on the control and/or evaluation unit within the scope of an actual value/target value comparison with regard to the power depending on the force to be applied to achieve a certain grinding degree or with regard to a bean type depending on the force to be applied to achieve a certain grinding degree. According to a further embodiment, it may be provided that when using a spring, the corresponding force-displacement characteristic curve is also specified as a data record, so that a specific adaptation of the spring force can be carried out by an actuator depending on the determined force to be applied. In the same way, the temperature of the grinder or the degree of wear (number of grinding processes) can be determined and the force to be applied can be adjusted accordingly by a target value/actual value comparison. It is also possible to combine the different sizes within the scope of a weighting, e.g. number of grinding processes with weighting according to bean type, in order to depict a more precise wear behavior. The grinder can optionally be equipped with a temperature sensor to determine the thermal expansion of the grinder and to control the force generation device to adjust the grinding degree. A method according to the invention for grinding coffee beans for the preparation of a caffeine-containing hot beverage, in particular by means of a grinder according to the invention, may comprise at least the following steps: a) Picking up of coffee beans in a grinding gap between two grinding tools; b) Applying an adjustable process force to at least one of the two grinding tools in the direction of the respective other grinding tool by a force generation device; and c) Output of the ground coffee or the ground product with a defined grinding degree. It is advantageous to adjust the magnitude of the process force depending on the type of coffee beans, the power of the grinder motor, the temperature of the grinder and/or the previous grinding passes. When adjusting the magnitude of the process force, a desired degree of fineness of the ground product can also be considered. Corresponding data records according to degree of fineness or grinding degree can be stored on the control and/or evaluation unit. During the grinding process, the cutting of the beans generates a force with which the cutting tools (grinding discs) are pressed apart. The stronger the force applied by the process force or counteracting force generation device, the finer the grinding degree. If there are no more beans, the disc-like grinding tools are clamped against each other with the contact pressure. Since the grinding tools are usually designed in such a way that they cannot get caught in each other, the grinder cannot fail. However, in the event of an empty bean container, grinding noise and damage to the flat surface of the grinding discs could occur. In addition, undesirable heat effects can occur, which can have a negative effect on the quality of the coffee grinding. With cone grinders, the cutting tools could even block. To solve this problem, it may be advantageously provided for the grinder to have a stop, in particular an adjustable stop, to set a minimum grinding degree. In this respect, it can be provided in particular that the axially movable tool part or the corresponding grinding tool is pressed against a stop. This end stop is adjustable before the grinder is put into operation and at the same time defines the minimum grinding degree to be produced. When force is applied, ideally there should only be a minimum gap between the cutting tools. If a greater contact pressure is subsequently specified than the process force during the grinding process, a ground product is produced with the fineness of this grinding disc gap. In practice, the touching point (beginning of audible grinding noises) of grinding disc grinders is an indicator of the zero point of the grinder. However, this is highly dependent on the axial run-out of the grinding discs and the individual hearing sensation of the grinder fitter. A suitable objective adjustment of the zero point can be carried out e.g. by an optional device to detect a certain electrical continuity of the lower and upper disc (electrical conductivity measurement). In conventional batches of grinders, grinding beans with respect to this reference point would still cause differences in the fineness distribution because the accuracy of the gap is directly related to the axial run-out tolerances of the discs. However, the use of this zero point definition for a force-controlled setting of the grinding degree has considerable advantages, because the subsequent fineness adjustment is only force-dependent and the stop is only used to prevent the touching point from being exceeded. Furthermore, such a construction leads to the avoidance of too finely adjusted grinders and overloading of the drive. A grinding degree that is too fine can lead to undesired long extraction times, in particular when producing filter coffee. Finally, this can also compensate for manufacturing tolerances in the design of the grinder. In terms of design, an end stop can be realized by means of a threaded adapter of one of the grinding disc carriers. Eventually, the carrier can be rotated up to the touching point of the cutting tools and then be fixed in this position. Thus, a minimum fineness level can be designed to be adjustable so that the cutting tools cannot grind on each other. The method according to the invention can also be further optimized by appropriate options. Therefore, it may be provided that a blockage of the cutting tools caused by impurities in the beans (pieces of wood, stones) can be released by removing the application of force. This is a simple and effective solution to the problem of cutting tool blockage. The grinder can be designed as a disc or roller or cone grinder according to advantageous embodiments. In one embodiment of the method it is provided that the adjustment of the magnitude of the process force is controlled by a control loop, wherein the control loop comprises the control and/or evaluation unit and at least one force measuring device having at least one force sensor. This has the advantage of enabling direct regulation of the grinder with regard to particle fineness. For this purpose, the grinder has in a further embodiment at least one force measuring device having at least one force sensor, wherein the at least one force sensor is directly or indirectly connected to the grinding tool. Such a force sensor can be a low-cost, high-quality component available on the market. For this purpose, different embodiments such as hydraulic pressure sensors, load cells, etc. are suitable. Another embodiment is designed in such a way that the at least one force sensor is connected to the control and/or evaluation unit and forms a measuring device of a control loop, which has the control and/or evaluation unit. The control and/or evaluation unit can have a computer, the programming of which can be extended by one or more control programs. This results in the following advantages: compensation of thermal expansion effects; quick initial adjustment of a grinder (in particular when changing the grinding tool); fineness adjustment during bean change; and direct regulation of the grinder with regard to particle fineness. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the following, the invention is described in more detail with reference to the drawings by means of an exemplary embodiment. The figures only serve to explain the invention in more detail and are not restrictive for the invention. Individual features described can also be transferred to further embodiment variants within the scope of general technical knowledge, wherein: FIG. 1: is a schematic front view in section of an embodiment of a grinder according to the invention for grinding coffee beans; FIG. 2: is a diagram showing the results of a series of grinding tests; FIG. 3: is another diagram showing the results of a series of grinding tests; FIG. 4: is a schematic front view in section of an embodiment of a grinder according to the invention for grinding coffee beans; and FIG. 5: is the front view of the grinder according to FIG. 1 with a force sensor device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a schematic front view in section of the device according to the invention, in the form of a grinder 1 for grinding coffee beans 5 . Grinder 1 has a first grinding tool 2 . The first grinding tool 2 is non-rotatably mounted in a housing not shown here. In this respect, the first grinding tool 2 is at a standstill during operation of grinder 1 . The first grinding tool 2 is designed here as a grinding disc and therefore has a cylindrical envelope geometry and a central opening 3 . The grinding tool 2 can also be designed differently, e.g. as a grinding cone. The opening 3 can be penetrated by a feed hopper 4 . Coffee beans 5 to be ground are fed to the device 1 through the feed hopper 4 and the opening 3 . The grinder 1 can also be provided for grinding other semi-luxury foods or foodstuffs but is preferably intended for grinding coffee beans 5 . The feed hopper 4 is advantageously designed to prevent undesirable bridge formation of the coffee beans 5 in the feed hopper 4 . The first grinding tool 2 has a conical recess 6 on its side facing away from the feed hopper 4 . The recess 6 has at least one grinding edge 7 . The grinder 1 has a second grinding tool 8 . The second grinding tool 8 is arranged coaxially to the first grinding tool 2 and below the first grinding tool 2 . The term “below” refers to the drawing plane of FIG. 1. The second grinding tool 8 is rotatably mounted in a housing not shown here. In this respect, the second grinding tool 8 rotates during operation of grinding tool 1 . The second grinding tool 8 also has a cylindrical envelope geometry. The second grinding tool 8 can also be designed differently, e.g. as a grinding cone. The second grinding tool is rotatable relative to the first grinding tool. In this case, the second grinding tool 8 is non-rotatably connected to a drive shaft 9 of a motor 10 so that the second grinding tool 8 is set in rotation while the first grinding tool 2 stands still. This is advantageous, but not mandatory. Alternatively, the first grinding tool can be rotatable or rotated during operation while the second grinding tool 8 stands still. It is also possible that both grinding tools can be rotated, e.g. in opposite directions of rotation and/or at different speeds, so that there is always a relative movement between the two grinding tools 2 , 8 . Alternatively, a shaftless direct drive is also possible, in which one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is the rotor of the motor 10 , or an indirect drive, in which the motor 10 acts upon one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 via a transmission. The second grinding tool 8 has a conical recess 11 on its side facing away from the motor 10 . The recess 11 has at least one grinding edge 12 . The conical recess 6 of the first grinding tool 2 and the conical recess 11 of the second grinding tool 8 thus form a kind of double conical grinding chamber 13 , which opens at its outer circumference into a grinding gap 14 . A collecting device (not shown here) can be connected to the grinding gap 14 , which collects the coffee beans, preferably coffee powder, emerging from the grinding gap 14 and feeds the powder into an extraction process. The grinder 1 has at least one force generation device 15 . In this case, the force generation device 15 acts upon the first grinding tool 2 , which means that a respective force F acts continuously, i.e. during operation while one or both grinding tools are rotating, upon coffee beans located between the first grinding tool 2 and the second grinding tool 8 . This is advantageous, but not mandatory. The force generation device 15 can also act upon the second rotatable grinding tool 8 or upon both grinding tools 2 , 8 . Here, the force generation device 15 comprises two pressure springs 16 , which can be pretensioned by a corresponding device 17 , for example by a servomotor, by a variable pretension path X, so that the respective force F, which acts upon the first grinding disc 2 and thus, during operation upon the coffee beans, can be changed or adjusted in its amount. The force generation device 15 can also be designed differently than shown in FIG. 1. In this case, the force effect is essential, wherein the amount of force F is preferably variable or adjustable. In this case, the force generation device 15 can also be designed in such a way that the amount of force F is controlled automatically and/or infinitely variable depending on the higher-level operating parameters of a coffee machine. This makes it advantageously possible to carry out a defined presetting of a grinding degree C, since the force F correlates with the grinding degree C, i.e. the size distribution of the ground product particles, characterized by the particle size of the 50% median of the ground coffee, which will be explained below. In addition, the force acting upon the coffee beans by the grinder 1 can be set advantageously by the force generation device, depending on the coffee beans 5 to be ground and the desired grinding degree C. Preferably, data records regarding the grinding degree C and the bean type and the force to be generated by the force generation device are stored on a data memory of a control and/or evaluation unit 18 for controlling a coffee machine and in particular the grinder 1 . The aforementioned control and/or evaluation unit 18 can be assigned to the grinder 1 or be part of a coffee machine, e.g. a fully automatic coffee machine. A setting of the grinding degree C can thus be adjusted to match the specific bean (e.g. hard/heavily roasted beans vs. less heavily roasted café crème beans). See also FIG. 3 in this respect. Alternatively, the type of beans can also be determined by the difference in power of the grinding efficiency by means of which the motor 10 is operated. Furthermore, the force-controlled adjustment of the grinding degree C allows a permanent reproducibility of the grinding degree C even in case of grinding tool wear. For this purpose, a characteristic curve for wear over time can be stored for each bean type. The number of grinding processes can be weighted differently depending on the bean type used. Thus, for example, after 100 grinding processes of a “hard” bean type, a readjustment can be made by means of the device 17 . Likewise, the force-controlled setting of the grinding degree C can be used advantageously to compensate for thermal expansion effects, in particular of the grinding tools 2 and 8 . For this purpose, a temperature sensor 23 (see FIG. 5) can detect the heat of the coffee beans as they leave the grinder 1 , represented by the double arrow—dashed line between the arrow at the output of the grinder and the temperature sensor 23 , which has an output leading to the control and/or evaluation unit 18 which, taking into account the coefficients of thermal expansion of the material of the grinding tools, accordingly adjusts the force of the force generation device 15 , in particular the pretensioning force of the pressure springs 16 . Furthermore, manufacturing inaccuracies of the grinding tools 2 , 8 , such as axial run-out tolerances of the grinding tools 2 , 8 have a significantly lower disturbing influence on the “grinding degree zero setting” of grinder 1 than in other grinding devices. Consequently, there are advantageously lower fluctuations of a grinding efficiency O of the grinder 1 and the generated grinding degree C during operation of the grinder 1 . The grinder 1 described here opens up the possibility of changing the grinding degree C of coffee beans, including espresso beans, in a force-controlled manner via the force generation device 15 . The inventive idea is based on a relationship between the force F acting upon the grinding tools 2 , 8 and the resulting distribution of the particle size of the coffee beans. The narrower the grinding gap 14 is, the finer is the ground product produced and the greater the reaction force with negative sign −F with which the grinding tools 2 , 8 are pressed apart. In embodiments according to the prior art, this force is absorbed by the grinding housing via the upper grinding tool. The relationship between a fixed geometry of the grinding tools 2 , 8 and the resulting relationship between the amount of force and the grinding degree C can be determined empirically (see FIG. 2). The knowledge gained from this can be used to permanently and precisely adjust the grinding degree C of the device 1 . If the magnitudes of the forces are known, they can be specified in certain gradations in order to produce a specific grinding degree C (see also FIG. 3). FIG. 3 shows the results of a grinding test series. In this case, the upper grinding disc 2 was subjected to different forces F and then three grinds were performed with the Bacio Nero bean. The coffee powder was then measured with a particle measuring device (measurement based on laser diffraction). The different grinding samples correspond to the three characteristic curves fineness measurement 1 - 3 , wherein the median of the fineness distribution (grinding degree C) is used as characteristic in each case. At the same time the grinding efficiency O of the device 1 was noted, i.e. the output grinding quantity of the device 1 per second. The device 1 was controlled by the motor 10 with power supply 230V, 50 Hz for 5 s each. FIG. 3 considers the influence of the amount of force F on the grinding degree C and the grinding efficiency O when grinding different beans. The bean types Bacio Nero, La Tazza Verde (Melitta) and a reference type were ground. In this case again, grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C were recorded at different amounts of force F acting upon the grinding tools 2 , 8 . Experiments have therefore shown that there is a good correlation between grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C of a bean, provided that the production accuracy of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is within a certain tolerance (see FIG. 2 and FIG. 3). From the grinding efficiency O of different grinders, it is therefore possible to draw conclusions about the produced grinding degree C with a high degree of accuracy, provided that the behavior of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is known. Under these conditions, a bean-specific force F can be inferred, with which a desired particle size distribution or a desired grinding degree C can be achieved. With the help of a database, in which the behavior of a reference roast and reference bean is stored, a control of the force F can then be performed in order to set the desired particle size distribution or the desired grinding degree C for the current roast and bean. As soon as the grinding efficiency O changes to a corresponding force F, because another bean or roast is used or the batch of a roast or bean type can be ground differently, the system regulates independently by a factor that depends on the grinding degree. This means that the force F is adjusted in order to obtain a desired particle size distribution or a desired grinding degree C. Furthermore, for presetting a fully automatic coffee machine, a grinder-specific determination of the relationship between grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C is conceivable. In this way, increased accuracy can be generated for a specific grinder and the roast or bean type to be ground in it, in order to set a required grinding degree C at a specified amount of force F. The grinding efficiency O of device 1 can be determined by means of already known methods: An indirect possibility is to use a cake height of the coffee powder in the extraction process at a given contact pressure to infer the weight of the coffee powder provided for the extraction process. A piston coffee machine offers this possibility due to the already existing brewing unit. Since the control time of the grinder is specified, the grinding efficiency O can then be inferred. A direct possibility is to weigh out the coffee powder. This can be automated by grinding in a set drawer and controlling it with a load cell. Another possible application of a force-controlled setting of the grinding degree C is the combination of the device 1 with a regulation of the contact time between brewing water and coffee powder. To produce a constant beverage quality with a constant proportion of dissolved flavorings, a constant quantity of coffee powder with identical grinding degree C must be passed through by a specified amount of water within a certain time. Other basic conditions such as water temperature, contact pressure and brewing pressure must also remain as constant as possible during the brewing process so that the swelling behavior of the coffee is comparable and the contact time between the brewing water and the coffee powder remains identical. A further embodiment of the grinder 1 is shown in FIG. 4 which, in comparison to FIG. 1, shows a rolling element 19 arranged between the grinding tool 2 and the pressure springs 16 . It can also be a rolling bearing, e.g. a ball bearing or a needle bearing with a rolling element cage, wherein the pressure spring rests on the rolling element cage. This can extend coaxially to the feed hopper 4 . The rolling element bearing allows rotation of the grinding tool 2 without the connection point of the respective pressure spring rotating with it. This means that force can also be applied to a rotating tool element and, for example, force can also be applied to both tool elements. FIG. 5 shows the front view of the grinder according to the invention and FIG. 1 with the addition of one or more force sensor devices 20 arranged in cooperation with one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 . In this case, two sensor devices 20 are shown. A first force sensor 21 is in interaction with the grinding tool 8 at a standstill, whereas a second force sensor 22 is in interaction with the first grinding tool 2 . Each force sensor 21 , 22 can be directly or indirectly connected to the corresponding grinding tool 2 , 8 . The force sensors 21 , 22 can, for example, be a pressure sensor (e.g. a load cell or a hydraulic pressure sensor), which respectively records the force during a grinding process by direct or indirect measurement. Each force measuring device 20 is connected to the control and/or evaluation unit 18 , as shown by the arrows in FIG. 5, and forms a measuring device of a control loop. The control and/or evaluation unit 18 has at least one target value/actual value comparator and a manipulated variable generator, which is coupled to an electrical fineness adjustment of the grinder 1 , which is not shown, but can easily be imagined. Since the axial force/fineness ratio of different beans in a grinder can be determined empirically, the grinder 1 is able to electrically set/adjust desired grinding degrees and to regulate them against disturbing factors (temperature, bean change, grinding disc exchange) with this control loop. This results in the following advantages: 1. compensation of thermal expansion effects; 2. quick initial adjustment of a grinder (in particular when changing the grinding tool); 3. fineness adjustment during bean change; and 4. direct regulation of the grinder 1 with regard to particle fineness (see indirect regulation via extraction time of the coffee cake).","20210235934"

The term, “coffee beans” as used in the present invention mean raw coffee beans before roasting or roasted coffee beans subjected to a roasting treatment at high temperature thereby allowing the Maillard reaction to proceed, while the term “coffee extraction residue” means a residue after extracting a soluble solid from roasted coffee beans using such as water, warm water or steam. BACKGROUND ART Now, coffee is luxury to be drunk, which is obtained by harvesting fruits from coffee trees and purifying the albumen portion, followed by roasting, milling and further extraction. Polysaccharides account for about 48% of the albumen portion and are composed of galactomannan, arabinogalactan and cellulose (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 1). Galactomannans are polysaccharides composed of galactose and mannose, and examples of galactomannan distributing usually on the market include such as Fenugreek gum obtained from seeds of Fenugreek, guar gum obtained from seeds of guar, locust bean gum obtained from seeds of locust bean, tara gum obtained from seeds of tara and cassia gum obtained from seeds of cassia. Galactomannan can be produced by extracting the above plant with such as water, hot water, alkali or acid. Galactomannans are polysaccarides which cannot be digested by human and are therefore said generally to be a dietary fiber. Galactomannans have a property of absorbing moisture to form a gel when dissolved in water, and are widely used as a thickener in industrial raw materials for foods, cosmetics, medical supplies and the like. These galactomannans have such a feature that a ratio of galactose to mannose varies depending on the kind of plants from which raw materials are derived. For example, a ratio of galactose to mannose is 1:1 for Fenugreek gum, 1:2 for guar gum, and 1:4 for locust bean gum. Galactomannans have such a property that water solubility, emulsifiability and stability are improved as the ratio of galactose to mannose increases. The reason is that 100% mannan containing no galactose is insoluble in water, and galactose in the side chain enables a polymer of mannan to extend thereby preventing formation of a bound substance which is insoluble in water. Therefore, it is said that galactomannans containing a larger amount of galactose are useful in food, cosmetic and medical supply industries. A method of purification of Fenugreek gum containing the largest amount of galactose among galactomannans is disclosed (see, for example, Patent Document 1). It has recently become apparent that galactomannans have various effects as a result of an intensive study on functionality of galactomannans other than the role as a thickener and a stabilizer in food, cosmetic and medical supply industries. Examples of the effect include effects such as reducing cholesterol in blood, improving and preventing an impaired liver function, suppressing absorption of a purine body, preventing obesity and improving allergic constitution. Therefore, galactomannans are functional food materials which will attract attention in future. Galactomannans are also contained in coffee beans. It is considered that, if galactomannans with good quality are contained in plant materials such as coffee beans which are distributed/consumed in large quantities in the world, these plant materials are very useful as resources of galactomannans. It is said that a ratio of galactose to mannose is very small in galactomannans contained in coffee beans, and the ratio is from 1:16 to 1:18 for raw beans (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 2). These polysaccharides containing a large amount of mannose are slightly water soluble and are hardly used in the food industry or the like and, therefore, galactomannans derived from coffee beans have never been industrially used. Arabinogalactan is a kind of water soluble hemicelluloses and is a cell wall constituent component which is common to all plants, and is a generic name of polysaccharides in which a side chain composed of arabinose or galactose is bonded to a main chain composed of galactose. Arabinogalactan is classified roughly into Type I arabinogalactan and Type II arabinogalactan according to a difference in structure. In the case of Type I arabinogalactan, a main chain having a β-(1→4)-galactopyranoside bond and a side chain having an α-L-arabonose residue are bonded. Type II arabinogalactan is made of a main chain having a β-(1→3)-galactopyranoside bond and a side chain composed of a β-(1→6)-galactopyranoside bond modified with α-L-arabonose, and has such a feature that it contains an ultratrace amount of xylose, rhamnose, fucose, glucuronic acid and the like. A large amount of Type II arabinogalactan is contained in the albumen portion of coffee beans. Non-patent Document 1 discloses that the content of Type II arabinogalactan in robusta ( Coffea canephora var. robusta ) is 17% in coffee beans (dry weight basis) and is about 3% more than that of arabica ( Coffea arabica ). When coffee beans are roasted, arabinogalactan is decomposed by heat upon roasting and arabinose in the side chain is cleaved thereby converting into an aroma component and a pigment component. Therefore, roasted coffee beans contain arabinogalactan containing a small amount of arabonose (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 3). Since arabinogalactan has low viscosity among water soluble polysaccharides, the solid concentration can be increased without increasing viscosity. Arabinogalactan is used in ink for the purpose of improving color transferability, improving stability and the like. Recently, use of arabinogalactan as a functional food material is expected in view of a prebiotic effect (see, for example, Non-Patent Document 4). Thus these coffee beans contain arabinogalactan and are considered to be useful in food, cosmetic and medical supply industries. However, it is difficult to extract arabinogalactan. It is necessary to extract with an alkali having very high concentration for a long time so as to extract arabinogalactan from coffee beans. For example, Non-Patent Document 5 describes that only a half amount of arabinogalactan is extracted even when extracted with 20% NaOH at 100° C. for a whole day and night. As described above, since coffee beans contain a large amount of arabinogalactan, it was not practical for commercial production.

Vitzhum, COFFEE Recent Developments, Blackwell Science p4 (2001) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention The object of the present invention is to provide a method of efficiently producing polysaccharides from coffee beans or/and a coffee extraction residue which have not easily been decomposed and have been done in the past focused on heretofore, especially to provide a method of efficiently isolating arabinogalactan or galactan and galactomannan. Means for Solving the Problems As a result of the extensive study to solve the above problems, it has been found that the above object can be achieved by the following method of producing polysaccharides from coffee beans or/and a coffee extraction residue, and the present invention was thereby completed. That is, the present invention relates to a method of producing polysaccharides from coffee beans or/and a coffee extraction residue, comprising: (a) step of milling coffee beans or/and a coffee extraction residue to the particle which diameter is from 10.0 μm to 5.0 mm, (b1) step of conducting heat treatment at 50 to 100° C. in the presence of diluted alkali, after the step of (a), (c1) step of treating with cellulase, after the step of (b1), (b2) step of conducting heat treatment at 120° C. or more in the presence of diluted alkali, after the step of (c1), and (c2) step of treating with cellulase, after the step of (b2) (claim 1 ). Namely, according to the present invention, it has been found that, by repeating a method of subjecting coffee beans or a coffee extraction residue to an alkali treatment and then treating with an enzyme derived from microorganism, particularly cellulase, a cell wall constituent component of coffee beans is directly treated thereby isolating monosaccharides and oligosaccharides derived from cellulose, and thus arabinogalactan and galactomannan containing a large amount of galactose can be effectively extracted. As a result, it became possible to provide a method of efficiently producing polysaccharides from coffee beans or a coffee extraction residue which have not easily been decomposed heretofore. In the present invention, 85% or more of the cell wall component of coffee beans and/or a coffee extraction residue is solubilized (claim 2 ). As described above, arabinogalactan is a cell wall constituent component and it was very difficult to extract from coffee beans and/or a coffee extraction residue by a conventional method. According to the present invention, it has been found that 85% or more of the cell wall component can be solubilized by optimizely using two-stage alkali and enzyme treatments in combination under predetermined temperature conditions. Thus, it became possible to efficiently extract polysaccharides such as arabinogalactan and galactomannan. In the present invention, the cell wall component is composed of arabinogalactan and galactan to form a cell wall structure (claim 3 ). As a result of the above verification, it has been found that not only arabinogalactan or galactan but also a galactomannan portion having a large amount of galactose, which has commercially high value, exists in the cell wall of coffee beans. In the present invention, it became possible to extract arabinogalactan and galactomannan, efficiently and mildly, in a simple and easy manner from such a cell wall component by subjecting coffee beans or a coffee extraction residue to a predetermined treatment. In the present invention, the polysaccharides include arabinogalactan or galactan (claim 4 ). As described above, coffee beans contain arabinogalactan and it is very difficult to extract arabinogalactan. It is necessary to extract with an alkali having very high concentration for a long time so as to extract arabinogalactan by a conventional method. In the present invention, it became possible to efficiently extract arabinogalactan or galactan in a simple and easy manner from such a cell wall component by subjecting coffee beans or a coffee extraction residue to a predetermined treatment. In the present invention, the polysaccharides include galactomannan containing 30% or more of galactose (claim 5 ). As a result of the above verification, it has been found that only conventional galactomannan having a very small ratio of galactose to mannose is not distributed on the cell wall of coffee beans and a galactomannan portion having a large ratio of galactose to mannose (30% or larger), which has commercially high value, exists. In the present invention, it became possible to extract arabinogalactan and galactomannan, efficiently and mildly, in a simple and easy manner by the method described above. EFFECT OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, arabinogalactan having arabinose and galactan in a ratio of 1:2.4 to 1:4, and galactan composed of galactose and galactomannan having galactose and mannose in a ratio of 1:1 to 1:3 can be effectively obtained by using coffee beans or a coffee extraction residue as raw materials.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention will be described in detail by a method of producing arabinogalactan and galactomannan derived from coffee beans or a coffee extraction residue with reference to a flow chart shown in FIG. 1. An alkali treatment and an enzyme treatment are not limited thereto and good results are obtained by appropriately repeating these treatments. However, yield of galactomannan increases when the alkali treatment and the enzyme treatment are alternately repeated. Coffee beans used in the present invention are derived from three foundation seeds of cultivated species of the genus Coffea belonging to madder plants, for example, Coffea arabica, Coffea canephora and Coffea liberica , and several tens kinds of coffee plants derived therefrom. Coffea Arabica occupies about two-thirds of the production amount of coffee in the world and has a feature such as high quality and rich aroma. Coffea canephora has strong bitterness and also has no sourness and does not have rich aroma, and is therefore suited for blending. Coffea liberica has low quality and is produced in a small amount and is not imported into Japan. The present invention relates to a method of producing polysaccharides from coffee beans or/and a coffee extraction residue, comprising: (a) step of milling coffee beans or/and a coffee extraction residue, (b1) step of conducting heat treatment in the presence of diluted alkali (the first alkali treating step is the step ‘b1’), (c1) step of treating with enzyme cellulase (the first enzyme treating step is the step ‘c1’), (b2) step of another conducting heat treatment in the presence of diluted alkali (the second alkali treating step is the step ‘b2’), and (c2) step of another treating with enzyme cellulase (the second enzyme treating step is the step ‘c2’) (claim 1 ). Namely, a cell wall constituent component of coffee beans is directly treated thereby isolating monosaccharides and oligosaccharides derived from cellulose, and thus arabinogalactan and galactomannan containing a large amount of galactose can be effectively extracted. Description will be made below by way of each step. (a) Step of Milling Coffee Beans or Coffee Extraction Residue In the present invention, it is possible to use coffee beans obtained with any derivation or by any process. However, it is preferred to increase surface area by milling coffee beans into powders using various mills so as to efficiently produce arabinogalactan and galactomannan. Namely, when a coffee extraction residue discharged from a coffee beverage factory is used as it is, even if the objective product can be obtained, the yield is low. So by milling the coffee extraction residue, the disintegration rate of coffee beans increases by 2 to 3 times and the yield of arabinogalactan and galactomannan increases. Specifically, the coffee extraction residue can be milled using dry mills such as jet-, tornado-, ball- and cutter-type mills. When the coffee extraction residue is finely milled, the enzyme reaction proceeds more easily. Regarding the particle size, the particle diameter (median value) is preferably from 10.0 μm to 5.0 mm, and more preferably from 10.0 μm to 0.6 mm. When the particle diameter is less than 10.0 μm, it becomes difficult to convey or handle because fine powders are formed. In contrast, when the particle diameter is 5.0 mm or more, a treating function is not sufficiently exerted and an extraction efficiency decreases. When the coffee beans or coffee extraction residue contain a large amount of fat, they may be appropriately defatted with such as hot water, steam or an organic solvent. Also, an organic solvent or a mixed solvent of an organic solvent and water can be used. Specific examples of the organic solvent include such as ethanol, methanol, propanol, ethylether, hexane and chloroform. (b1) Step of Conducting Heat Treatment in the Presence of Diluted Alkali (First Time) In the present invention, a pretreatment with an alkali is conducted as the pretreatment process. It has been found that by conducting an alkali treatment as the pretreatment process, a body complex, sucrose, polyphenol, water soluble polysaccharides and the like existing in the structure of coffee beans or a brown pigment and water soluble polysaccharides existing in the coffee extraction residue are removed through extraction, and the subsequent enzyme reaction easily proceeds. The body complex means a portion which is included in cells of the albumen portion of plants, and is in the form of a lump in which lipid, protein and the like inside of a primary cell wall are coated with a film made of pectin and the like. In the case of soybeans, a typical body structure can be observed (Kasai N et al., Isolation and Enzymatic Digestion of Body Complex of Soybean Seed, J. Agric Food Chem, 53, 10026-10033 (2005)). It is possible to use, as the aqueous alkali solution, those approximately selected from aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide and the like. The amount of the aqueous alkali solution is preferably a 5- to 30-fold amount of dry coffee raw beans, roasted coffee beans or a coffee extraction residue. When coffee raw beans or roasted coffee beans are used, a similar pretreatment is required. In the roasted coffee beans or coffee extraction residue, since a coffee brown pigment as a thermal reaction product of such as sucrose, protein or polyphenol adheres to the cell wall component, this alkali treatment may be repeated twice or more. (b1-1) Study of Alkali Treatment Concentration and Treatment Time Since the alkali treatment concentration and the time are preferably set to conditions as mild as possible, the alkali concentration and the time were studied. (1) In the study, 0.1 g of a coffee extraction residue was specifically used and, after treating with a 50-fold amount of the above NaOH solution, the eluted brown substance was measured at an absorbance of 405 nm. A NaOH solution having an alkali concentration of 2,000 mM (mol %), 1,000 mM, 500 mM, 250 mM, 125 mM, 62.5 mM, 31.25 mM, 15.63 mM, 7.813 mM or 0 mM (distilled water, control) was used. The study was made under the conditions of the treating time of 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours and 4 hours and the treatment temperature of 120° C. (2) All tests were conducted four times, and the resultant averages and SD (standard deviation) were shown in graphs. As a result, as shown in FIG. 2, in the alkali pretreatment, the amount of the brown substance to be eluted tends to increase as the treatment time increases at any alkali concentration. However, in the test section at the alkali concentration within a range from 125 to 2,000 mM, a significant difference was not recognized when analysis of variance and multiple comparison were conducted in the amount of the brown pigment eluted by the treatment for 4 hours, for example. In the test section at the alkali concentration within a range from 0 to 125 mM, a significant difference at a significance level of 5% was entirely recognized when analysis of variance and multiple comparison were conducted in the amount of the brown pigment eluted by the treatment for 4 hours, for example. (b1-2) Study of Alkali Treatment Concentration and Treatment Temperature A relation between the alkali treatment concentration and the treatment temperature was studied. (1) In the study, a NaOH solution having an alkali concentration of 0.02 M, 0.1 M or 1 M was used in the alkali pretreatment. The study was made under the conditions of the treating temperature of 20° C., 40° C., 60° C., 80° C., 90° C., 110° C. and 120° C. and the treatment time of 1 hour and 2 hours. After subjecting to the pretreatment under the above conditions, an enzyme treatment was conducted using cellulase as an enzyme derived from microorganism and a presence or an absence of a coffee extraction residue exists was determined. (2) As the results of the case where the pretreatment was conducted, as shown in FIG. 3 (treatment time: 1 hour) and FIG. 4 (treatment time: 2 hours), regarding the treatment concentration, the amount of the brown pigment to be eluted tends to increase depending on the concentration. However, there was not a large difference in the amount of the brown pigment to be eluted between 1 M NaOH and 0.1 M NaOH. Regarding the treatment temperature, the amount of the brown pigment to be eluted increased at the temperature of 90° C. or higher in both cases of the treatment time of 1 hour and 2 hours. The results of the case where the enzyme treatment was conducted are shown in a micrograph of FIG. 5. When a pretreatment was conducted at 100° C. or lower for 1 hour using 0.1 M NaOH or a pretreatment was conducted at 50° C. or lower for 1 hour using 1 M NaOH, the existence of a coffee extraction residue was confirmed. Then in the test section of the subsequent enzyme treatment, when 0.1 M NaOH was used in and a pretreatment was conducted at 50° C. for 1 hour, disintegration of the coffee extraction residue was recognized, and when 0.1 M NaOH was used and a pretreatment was conducted at 100° C. for 1 hour, the coffee extraction residue was disintegrated. (b1-3) Summary of the Study Results From the above study results, the concentration of the aqueous alkali solution in the alkali treatment is preferably 0.1 M or more, and more preferably from 0.1 to 1 M. The alkali treatment time is preferably about 1 hour or more, and more preferably a pretreatment is conducted under a heating condition for 2 or more hours. The alkali treatment temperature is preferably a heating temperature of 90° C. or higher so as to increase the amount of the brown substance to be eluted. It is preferably a heating temperature of 50° C. or higher so as to cause disintegration of the coffee extraction residue in the enzyme treatment in the post-process. Furthermore, it is preferable to conduct a pretreatment under a heating temperature of 90° C. or higher so as to make a state free from the coffee extraction residue in appearance. Provided that it is possible to make a state where the coffee extraction residue scarcely exists by adjusting the concentration of the aqueous alkali solution even under the heating temperature of 90° C. or lower. The pretreatment temperature is preferably low temperature so as to early realize the conditions where the enzyme used in the enzyme treatment is not deactivated (for example, 60° C. or lower). When a two-stage heat treatment (b2) and a two-stage enzyme treatment (c2) described hereinafter are conducted, a first alkali treatment is conducted for the purpose of removing the brown pigment and the body complex, and the heat treatment at an early stage is preferably conducted at a temperature of 50 to 100° C. When the amount of the alkali is increased and the treatment temperature is raised, the number of the alkali treatment can also be decreased. In this case, the amount of the alkali is preferably from a 5 to 30-fold amount, and particularly preferably a 10-fold amount or more. The conditions are preferably as follows: the concentration of the alkali is 0.1 M or more, the treatment temperature is 100° C. or higher, and the treatment time is 20 minutes or more. (c1) Step of Treating with Enzyme Cellulase (First Time) The conditions of the enzyme reaction of the alkali-treated coffee beans and coffee extraction residue will be described below. The enzyme used in the present invention is derived from microorganism and is not specifically limited as long as it has an activity capable of disintegrating the cell wall component by treating with the coffee beans and coffee extraction residue. Microorganism are bacteria which have been used for a long time as bacteria capable of producing an enzyme such as pectinase used to clarify juice and hemicellulase used to improve an extraction rate of coffee, and also have established safety. Such an enzyme can be obtained by culturing microorganism. The culturing process is not specifically limited as long as it is a process capable of producing a polysaccharides disintegrating enzyme, and a conventional culturing process such as solid or liquid culturing process may be used. Culturing may be conducted under conventional culturing conditions. In the present invention, any fraction having an activity capable of disintegrating coffee beans and a coffee extraction residue. If necessary, it is also possible to use those obtained by purification or partial purification of the fraction having an activity capable of disintegrating the coffee beans and coffee extraction residue. Also, a commercially available exogenous enzyme may be used and examples of the exogenous enzyme include such as cellulase DAIWA (Daiwa Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.). This exogenous enzyme is commercially available as an exogenous enzyme for food, and has already been used in foods and also has established safety. Cellulase DAIWA is a kind of cellulases produced by microorganism of the genus Trichoderma. The conditions for treatment of the coffee beans and coffee extraction residue with the above enzyme may be any conditions used in a conventional enzyme reaction. However, the reaction preferably arises under optimum operating conditions of the enzyme used. The reaction is preferably conducted under the conditions where the enzyme is not deactivated and the reaction temperature is preferably from 25 to 65° C., and more preferably from 50 to 60° C. About pH of the reaction, the reaction is preferably conducted under the optimum operating conditions of the enzyme as a matter of course, and pH is preferably from 2 to 9, and more preferably from 4.0 to 6.0. (c1) Study on Enzyme Reaction A coffee extraction residue was disintegrated using an enzyme derived from microorganism and the produced saccharides were analyzed and what was produced was studied. (1) To 2.0 g of an alkali-treated coffee extraction residue (which is obtained by adding a 50-fold amount of 0.1 M NaOH to a coffee extraction residue, followed by autoclaving at 120° C. for 1 hour, filtration and further drying), 15 mL of a 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and 1 mL of an enzyme solution prepared by dissolving 80 mg of cellulase DAIWA (Daiwa Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.) in 1 mL of a 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5.0) were added and an enzymatic hydrolysis reaction was conducted at 40° C. 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after the initiation of the reaction, sampling was conducted. After centrifugal separation, an enzyme reaction was terminated by heating to a deactivation temperature (70° C.) of the enzyme. With respect to each sample, a neutral saccharide was analyzed by an alditol acetate process. (2) As shown in FIG. 6, a reducing saccharide and uronic acid are similarly produced as the increase of the total amount of the saccharide increases with the proceeding of the enzyme reaction. As the results of the graph, the amount of saccharides to be produced reaches to the upper limit after 24 hours of the enzyme reaction, and thus it is considered that the enzyme treatment time is preferably about 24 hours. From the amount of the total saccharide (48.05 mg/mL) and the amount of the reducing saccharide (21.77 mg/mL) after 24 hours of the enzyme reaction, it becomes 48.05/21.77≈2.21. Therefore, it is considered that an average saccharide chain number of the saccharide to be produced by the enzyme reaction is about 2.21. From the above results, the enzyme reaction time, which depends on the amount of the enzyme to be used, is preferably set within a range from 8 to 24 hours from an operational point of view. (c1-2) Analysis of Constitution of Saccharide Produced (1) Kinds of the reducing saccharide contained in a solution were analyzed. As a result, arabinose (Ara), galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), glucose (Glc) and rhamnose (Rha) were detected as monosaccharides as shown in FIG. 7. These saccharides are not originally contained in the coffee extraction residue, thus it is considered that these saccharides are derived from polysaccharides constituting the coffee extraction residue, namely, arabinogalactan and galactomannose containing a large amount of mannose, and are derived from constitution components of cellulose. Thus, it is considered that these monosaccharides are produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of coffee beans and the cell wall component of the coffee extraction residue through an enzyme produced by microorganism. (2) With respect to the portion which was not disintegrated by the above enzyme treatment, the saccharide was analyzed. As a result, it has been found that it is a cell wall component composed of polysaccharides containing galactose and mannose in a ratio of 1:1 to 2:3. (3) It has also been found that the polysaccharides component containing galactose and mannose in a ratio of 1:1 to 2:3 is partially contained in the cell wall of coffee beans and is a main constituent component of a structure included inside the cell in the form of a network (FIG. 8). This polysaccharides component could be easily recovered by a centrifugation treatment at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes. (b2) Step of Conducting Heat Treatment in the Presence of Diluted Alkali (Second Time) It is possible to separately isolate arabinogalactan having a ratio of arabinose to galactose of 1:4 to 1:2.4 and galactomannan constituting protein having a ratio of galactose to mannose of 1:1 to 1:3 by additionally treating the polysaccharides component derived from cell wall obtained by the above method with 0.1 M NaOH at 120° C. for 10 minutes. At this time, regarding the conditions of the alkali treatment, as described in (b1-3), the concentration of an aqueous alkali solution is preferably 0.1 M or more, and more preferably from 0.1 to 1 M. The alkali treatment time is preferably about 1 or more hours, and more preferably a pretreatment is conducted under heating conditions for 2 or more hours. It is preferred to conduct a pretreatment under a heating condition at a temperature of 120° C. or higher so as to increase a brown substance to be eluted and to make a state free from a coffee extraction residue in an enzyme treatment at a post-process. Namely, a first alkali treatment is conducted for the purpose of removing a brown pigment and a body complex and may be conducted at a temperature of 50 to 100° C. However, a second alkali treatment must be at a temperature of 120° C. or higher. As a result, arabinogalactan bonded firmly to a cell wall is eluted at the same temperature and a matrix part is properly exposed, thus allowing the subsequent enzyme reaction to proceed. (c2) Step of Treating with Enzyme Cellulose (Second Time) Galactomannan with further enhanced purity can be obtained by treating the resultant galactomannan constituting portion having galactose and mannose in a ratio of 1:1 to 1:3 with cellulose again. As described above, in the present invention, at least 85% or more of the cell wall component of coffee beans and a coffee extraction residue is solubilized by the production method in which two-stage alkali and enzyme treatments are optimizely used in combination. An enzyme treating solution contains monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, arabinogalactan and galactomannan containing the content of galactose of 30% or more, but contains no cellulose. When only arabinogalactan or galactomannan is isolated, purification can be conducted by a method of adding ethanol and recovering the resultant precipitate through a treatment such as centrifugal separation, or chromatography such as gel filtration. Alternately, a solubilized solution may be appropriately concentrated and dried in the form of a mixture. EXAMPLES The present invention will be described in detail below by way of examples. Example 1 Production of Arabinogalactan (Galactan) and Galactomannan from Coffee Extraction Residue A series of treatment steps and the saccharide composition of the extract solution and the solid residue portion are shown in FIG. 9. (1) Diluted Alkali Treatment (First Time) To 2 g of a defatted coffee extraction residue, a 10-fold amount of a 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 10.0) was added, followed by heating at 100° C. for 20 minutes.

After the heat treatment, an extract solution containing galactose and mannose in a ratio of 1:2.6 was obtained. Galactose in the extract solution is contained as a polymer and is found to be derived from arabinogalactan. Solid-liquid separation of the treating solution was conducted by centrifugal separation (at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes). The saccharide content of the supernatant was 59.5±3.7 mg.

After the completion of the reaction, solid-liquid separation was conducted by centrifugal separation (at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes) to obtain a solubilized solution containing galactomannan. The saccharide content of the supernatant was 177.9±24 mg and a ratio of galactose to, mannose was 1:3. (5) Results As shown in Table 1, the defatted coffee extraction residue finally contained 3.85% of the insoluble component as a result of a series of treatments. The final residue component mainly contained mannose. However, the insoluble component contained a very small amount of saccharide and was easily disintegrated when a pressure is applied using a finger.

After the heat treatment, solid-liquid separation of this treating solution was conducted by centrifugal separation (at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes) to obtain a water soluble fraction containing arabinogalactan and a cell wall component containing galactomannan. A ratio of arabinose to galactose of the water soluble fraction containing arabinogalactan was 1:2.4 and the saccharide content in the water soluble fraction was 94.9±10.3 mg. The amount of the cell wall component containing galactomannan was 40.5% by weight of initial untreated raw coffee beans. (3) Enzyme Treatment (First Time) 0.8 g of the cell wall component containing galactomannan obtained by the treatment (2) was dissolved in a 10-fold amount of a 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and cellulase DAIWA (Daiwa Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.) was added in the concentration of 1%, and then the reaction was conducted at 40° C. for 24 hours. After the reaction, solid-liquid separation was conducted by centrifugal separation (at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes) to obtain a solubilized solution containing 903±27.2 mg of monosaccharide, oligosaccharide and galactomannan. A ratio of galactose to mannose of galactomannan was 1:2.4. (4) Results As shown in Table 3, the defatted raw coffee beans finally contained 13.7% of the insoluble component as a result of a series of treatments. The final residue component mainly contained mannose. However, the insoluble component contained a very small amount of saccharide and was easily disintegrated when a pressure is applied by a finger.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a roasted and ground (R&G) whole coffee bean process and resulting products, wherein most of the chemical and organoleptic properties of roasted and ground beans are preserved for food and beverage consumption and its shelf-life extended. 2. Description of the Related Art Several methods for processing whole coffee beans have been practiced in the past. Most of them involve domestic or commercial brewing of the roasted and ground coffee bean powder wherein only a small portion (with yields usually of 15-20%) of the coffee is utilized as (soluble) beverage. The option known as soluble (or instant) coffee is obtained through industrial percolation of R&G coffee under high pressure and high temperature conditions of the extractive water. This allows for higher soluble extraction rates and partial hydrolysis of the hydrolysable solids, with beverage yields usually of 33 to 45% of the original coffee. None of them, however, include an efficient process that utilizes nearly 100% of the R&G coffee, while preserving most of the R&G chemicals and aroma. The preservation of the aroma, in the present invention, is achieved by preventing the oxidation of the coffee during the process of coating and utilization of inert gas atmosphere during the entire process. Applicant believes that a related reference corresponds to U.S. Pat. No. 9,314,042 ('042 patent) issued on Apr. 19, 2016, assigned to Tierra Nueva Fine Cocoa, LLC., and entitled “Method and Composition Used for the Manufacture of Coffee Liquor”. However, it differs from the present invention, as follows: First, the '042 patent utilizes as ingredient the standard R&G coffee, which was obtained through regular roasting and milling process conditions. This procedure exposes the resulting R&G to irreversible oxidation. The oxidation process takes place during the use of the initial process steps (i.e. the roasting and subsequently the milling). The coffee exposed to high roasting temperatures in the presence of atmospheric air and followed by atmospheric milling, initiates the irreversible oxidation process. Secondly, the process in this present invention defines that all processing steps (including R&G roasting), should be performed under inert gas in a closed or semi-closed loop processing steps, i.e. in absence of O2. This is another important difference from the '042 patent and prior art. Thirdly, the '042 patent relies on wet milling to obtain a particle not smaller than 10 microns. The average size sought for the final milled coffee particles is considerably further reduced to no greater than 5 microns. The present invention also differs because the end-product in the '042 patent is obtained exclusively in the form of a liquid or paste, and not in form of a water-based soluble/dispersible powder as described and claimed herein. The fat-based liquid product of the '042 patent has significant limitations for powder applications, where wettability, water-solubility, and/or overall dispersion ability, as well as other physical, chemical and/or rheological features, are all required when presented in powder form. In the present invention the microencapsulation of ultra-fine powder, or the agglomeration and subsequent coating of the granules uniquely allows to the powdered product to satisfy the above mentioned properties, while protecting the product from oxidation. The shelf life of the finished products could be further extended if the protective packaging is filled with an inert gas, thus preventing the direct contact between particles and atmospheric oxygen. Other documents describing the closest subject matter provide for a number of more or less complicated features that fail to solve the problem in an efficient and economical way. None of these patents suggest the novel features of the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One of the main objects of the present invention is to provide a whole coffee bean process that preserves most of the chemical and organoleptic properties of the roasted and ground coffee bean. It is another object of this invention to provide coffee products, wherein coffee essential oil (including oil-soluble aroma components) of the generated R&G coffee bean could be extracted, stored, and preserved until it is ready to be added-back to the whole coffee-based products before the full process is completed. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a coffee product is soluble and dispersible in food liquids including water and milk. It is yet another object of this invention to provide such a process that is feasible and economically viable to implement and to maintain the quality and flavor attributes of the whole coffee bean, while retaining its effectiveness for preparation and consumption. Further objects of the invention will be brought out in the following part of the specification, wherein detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing the invention without placing limitations thereon. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING With the above and other related objects in view, the invention consists in the details of construction and combination of elements and process steps, conducting to the origination of innovative coffee and coffee-based products, as will be more fully understood from the following description, when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawing in which: FIG. 1 is a block flow diagram showing the preparation of full whole coffee bean food and beverage products, presenting the various blocks of processing steps. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention includes a complete process to manufacture coffee and coffee-based formulated products, encompassing roasting and cooling using inert gas as heating or cooling medium, cryogenic or refrigerated inert gas coarse (first) milling, optional mixing (Block 65 ) with vegetable fats and/or oils—preferably cocoa butter—optional conching (Block 75 ), optional SCFE (Block 85 ) (Super Critical Fluid Extraction)—depending on the level of oil/fat present, cryogenic (second) milling for fine-milling, cryogenic inert gas (third) ultra-milling, and completing the coffee and/or coffee-based finished products processing by either: 1) microencapsulating its ultra-fine particles; or 2) first agglomerating the ultra-fine particles and subsequently coating the resulting granules of the roasted and ground whole coffee beans. The microencapsulation and coating are achieved with food ingredients or additives for: 1) improving wettability; 2) improving solubility/dispersion; and 3), to preserve or to increase the content of fresh coffee aroma from being stripped from the coffee bean particles, —especially during the hot water preparation of the coffee beverage. Also, the ultrafine coffee particles (that are microencapsulated or the granules obtained from agglomeration) are coated with selected food ingredients and/or additives, as disclosed below. This technology provides a coffee particle with a surrounding coating to prevent the fine particles of the R&G coffee from being exposed to oxygen-rich atmospheres while in powdered form, and to help in the process of dispersion and solubilization of the coffee powder in liquids (before its preparation, as for example, in case of hot or cold beverages) with the most efficient use of the coffee bean. By “particle size” in this specification and claims it is understood the mean size of the particles in a binomial distribution curve for the size of the particles. The process in the present invention includes the following steps: A) The first processing step (Block 30 ) is the roasting the whole coffee bean in an inert gas atmosphere, either in a closed or semi-closed loop system. The inert gas may be nitrogen (N 2 ) or another suitable inert gas. Heating media is used to raise the temperature in an enclosed chamber that houses a rotary cylinder or fluid bed containing the green coffee beans. The equipment operation can be performed in batch or continuous modes, depending on the volume of green coffee to be processed. The chamber is initially filled with an inert gas and maintained at a predetermined safe pressure, using a relief valve to regulate the pressure. The pressure inside the chamber is preferably kept between one (1) Bar and ten (10) Bars, while the temperature inside the rotary cylinders or at the fluid bed chamber is kept between 100° C. and 230° C., in absence of oxygen. The roasting step can extend from two (2) minutes to sixty (60) minutes, depending on the roasting profile desired. The roasting level could be low, medium, or high as is typically referred in the industry. B) The second step of the process (Block 40 ) utilizes a two-stage vibratory fluid bed cooler to transport the roasted coffee bean. A closed-loop inert gas, two-stage fluid bed cooler that can be used is the Std. Model of the Food and Pharma Line, manufactured by Witte, 507 Rt. 31 S. Washington, N.J. 07882. The roasted coffee beans are cooled down in the first stage to a temperature between 50-100° C., but most preferably between 65° C. and 75° C. for at least one (1) minute, in order to interrupt the thermolysis process of the roasted bean. In the second stage, the temperature is brought down to ambient temperature. The objective being to stabilize the degree of the roasting level already achieved. The lower the temperature, the lower the undesirable thermolysis process. The roasted beans are kept at this temperature for a minimum of five (5) minutes, in order to facilitate the initiation of the degassing process on the roasted bean. The coffee beans can stay in the second stage indefinitely since it is shelf stable, provided the inert atmosphere is maintained. Both cooling stages are performed under an inert gas environment, by receiving a pressurized blow of cooled inert gas together with the mechanical vibratory screen to transport the beans forward. There is no oxygen present. During the first part of the cooling process, a spray may be added. The spray is a sugar solution containing between ten (10) percent to ninety (90) percent weight/weight. This may be done if it is desired to impart to the roasted beans a particular coffee taste and, in doing this, it also protects the roasted coffee beans against their precocity oxidation, in case the product is exposed to the atmospheric air. C) The third step of the process (Block 50 ) is carried out by an initial (first) milling of the roasted coffee beans. This is done by utilizing a number of suitable commercial cryogenic or refrigerated inert gas-type dry mills. Suitable equipment for this step includes the pin or turbo-mill, or other suitable impact milling equipment, manufactured by companies such as Pallmann, Wolfstrasse 51, D-66482, Zweibrueken, Germany, and Hosokawa Alpine, Peter-Doerfler Strasse 13-25, D-86199, Germany, the latter marketed as model MP. These universal dry mills are capable of milling the whole roasted green coffee beans down to the desired initial particle size of the milled beans, at this stage, between 75 and 500 microns, but preferably between 100 and 300 microns. A narrow particle size distribution is obtained to prevent filter plugging while executing optional pre-conching step (Block 75 ). This first milling step is performed at a temperature range between −190° C. and 10° C., to ensure suitable brittleness for efficient cryogenic milling is achieved. D) The fourth step of the process (Block 60 ) is designed to obtain essentially a whole coffee bean roasted and milled as a semi-finished product. For that the previously milled coffee is milled again for the second time under refrigerated or liquid inert gas (cryogenic conditions), to ensure that the final size of the bean particles falls between 10 and 30 microns. This can be accomplished by using available cryogenic ultra-mill equipment manufactured by Hosokawa Alpine, Germany, under its equipment model MP, or other suitable dry mill. This equipment can utilize a cryogenic inert gas (such as liquid N 2 ) that maintains the temperature, ensuring that the product can preferably reach low temperatures of around −80° C. before it is milled. For highly roasted coffee, it is possible to efficiently mill the product utilizing non-cryogenic conditions, i.e., by using refrigerated inert gas, provided that during the entire milling process the temperature is maintained below +10° C. The objective is to prevent that the product, during the milling process becomes overheated due to the mechanical effect of the milling. E) In the fifth step of the process (Block 70 ), the twice milled beans are once again milled (i.e. by the third time), now using a close- or semi-closed loop cryogenic or refrigerated inert gas jet mill, a dry milling-type equipment. The equipment that can be used for this step is manufactured by several companies, such as Fluid Energy, 4300 Bethlehem Pike, Telford, Pa. 18969, and marketed under model Jet-o-Mizer. Other suitable ultra-fine mills, operating under cryogenic milling conditions could be utilized in lieu of the jet mill such as the cryogenic ball mill. The bean particles are brought between one tenth (0.1) and less than ten (10) microns. The preferred size being five (5) microns or less. The result being that the product becomes a very fine powder that requires special filtering equipment to prevent dusting during handling. The ultrafine powder is then kept in an inert gas condition at all times to prevent aroma deterioration. F) In the sixth step (Blocks 80 or 90 ), the ultrafine powder can be either directly micro-encapsulated (Block 80 ), or agglomerated and coated in the same equipment (Block 90 ). Both options provide the necessary protection against oxidation (atmospheric O2) with improved disperse ability and dispersion stability under liquid dispersion. If the product is micro-encapsulated (Block 80 ), this process step is carried out by directly spraying on the ultra-fine powder, dispersant food ingredients and/or additives, respectively encompassing: sugar solutions and carbohydrate dispersions, and/or lecithins, tweens, spans, mono, and diglycerides, polyglycerols, and other antioxidants, emulsifiers, dispersants or stabilizers selected from the list of food additives approved by the US FDA to confer improved dispersion and stability of the micro-encapsulated coffee particles. This process step is carried out in a closed or semi-closed loop fluid bed drier, under refrigerated inert gas environment. The microencapsulation can be accomplished in batch or continuous mode for example, the continuous mode can be achieved using a spray drier, spray cooler, spray freezer or freeze drier. A processing alternative (Block 90 ) that has proved to be more economical includes initially agglomerating the ultra-fine powder in refrigerated inert gas conditions, in a closed-loop or semi-closed loop fluid bed (dryer or cooler) type agglomerator (batch or continuous). For agglomeration, the ultra-fine particles are first sprayed in the water while they are transported in a fluid bed. This will wet the surface of the particles. The particles will adhere to each other forming the granules. Subsequently, the granules are sprayed with dispersants and food anti-oxidants to form a coating around the granules. The granules are thus protected against oxidation. In the case of direct fluid bed microencapsulation (Block 80 —Alternative 1 ), the coffee oil (Block 95 ) and specific food or additive microencapsulating solutions and/or dispersions (Block 100 ), are simultaneously pulverized through means of inner spray nozzles, configured to directly coat the individual ultra-fine particles inside the fluid bed dryer or cooler. The temperature is allowed to be brought up to room temperature. For the agglomeration step (Block 90 —Alternative 2 ), the process encompasses: pre-wetting (through means of a micro-spray of cold water), agglomeration, drying and cooling the on-going formed agglomerates, —with or without the simultaneous inclusion of coffee oil (Block 95 ). This is achieved by continuously micro-spraying suitable food grade ingredient or additives solution through internal nozzles (Block 100 ), especially configured to apply film-coating to the agglomerated particles, with the total spread content from 0.5% to 15% weight/weight of the coffee granules, depending on the desired level of protection, and the level of physical-chemical improvement sought for the properties of the agglomerates, whenever they are dispersed into hot or cool food liquids. G) The resulting coated roasted whole coffee powder (or granulated products) (Block 110 ) is packaged in any of a wide range of packing options, including aluminum-plastic complex, BOPP, paper, plastic, glass, metal or combinations thereof. Although not required, the powder can be packed under inert gas, vacuum compensated or vacuum conditions, to secure that its long shelf-life (over one year) can be extended and/or maintained. The foregoing description conveys the best understanding of the objectives and advantages of the present invention. Different embodiments may be made of the inventive concept of this invention. It is to be understood that all matter disclosed herein is to be interpreted merely as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY It is apparent from the previous paragraphs that an improvement of the type for such a whole coffee based product and process is quite desirable for preserving its organoleptic characteristics and extending its shelf life.","11272720"

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a coffee roaster, and more particularly, a fluidized electric coffee roaster, whereby heated air is supplied and discharged from a lower part of a fluidizing chamber to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber having a cylindrical structure in which raw coffee beans are injected. The raw coffee beans are circulated from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber and roasted, thereby enabling roasting that maximizes the characteristics of the raw coffee beans while keeping the raw coffee beans from burning. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In general, three factors that determine the flavor of coffee are first, the type and quality of raw coffee beans; second, the degree of roasting of coffee; and third, a roasting method. In particular, the roasting method and the uniform roasting degree of raw coffee beans caused by the roasting method play a decisive role in flavor. Specifically, coffee roasting refers to the process of making coffee beans by heat-treating raw coffee beans. Raw coffee beans do not have any taste or smell by themselves, but when the cell tissues of raw coffee beans are destroyed through the roasting process, various components (fat, sugar, acidity, caffeine, etc.) are activated and released to the outside. That is, because some components of raw coffee beans are strengthened and other components are weakened during the coffee roasting process, the taste and aroma of coffee beans may vary greatly depending on the roasting method. A coffee roasting method according to the related art includes an electric method of roasting raw coffee beans while supplying hot air to the raw coffee beans using electric energy. Another method known in the art includes a gas method of roasting raw coffee beans by directly heating a rotating drum containing raw coffee beans with a heat source using gas energy. Under the electric method and the gas method of roasting raw coffee beans according to the related art, as high temperature and dry heat are transferred to the raw coffee beans, moisture in the raw coffee beans evaporates, so that the raw coffee beans are roasted in a dried state. Moreover, roasting raw coffee beans under either of these conventional methods takes a lot of time and energy to reach the proper temperature such that the taste and flavor are deteriorated. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a fluidized electric coffee roaster, whereby heated air is supplied and discharged from a lower part of a fluidizing chamber to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber having a cylindrical structure in which raw coffee beans are injected. The raw coffee beans are then circulated (fluidized) from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber and roasted, thereby enabling roasting that maximizes the characteristics of the raw coffee beans while preventing the raw coffee beans from burning.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Hereinafter, the present invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. As illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 9 , a fluidized electric coffee roaster according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a housing 110 having an upper chamber 111 and a lower chamber 112 , a fluidizing chamber 120 disposed in the upper chamber 111 and having a predetermined volume into which raw coffee beans are put, discharged and roasted, a heating unit 130 disposed in the lower chamber 112 and communicating with a lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 , an air supply unit 140 , which is located in the lower chamber 112 and configured to be connected to the heating unit 130 and in which, after external air inside the lower chamber 112 is heated through the heating unit 130 , heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and is discharged to an upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 . The air supply unit 140 is supplied with heated air to the lower part and discharged to the upper part, so that raw coffee beans are circulated from a lower part to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 and roasted. A flow auxiliary unit 150 is connected from the air supply unit 140 to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows external air inside the lower chamber 112 to be directly injected into the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 , such that when the raw coffee beans are heavy, it flows the raw coffee beans together with heated air. A dust collecting unit 160 , which is located in the upper chamber 111 , is configured to be connected to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and collects foreign substances in exhaust air discharged to the upper part of the fluting chamber 120 . A heat exchanging unit 170 , which is located in the lower chamber 112 , communicates with the dust collecting unit 160 , provides a discharge flow path through which the exhaust air from which the foreign substances discharged from the dust collecting unit 160 are removed, and is discharged to the outside of the lower chamber 112 to allow external air of the lower chamber 112 to be heat-exchanged by residual heat of the exhaust air so that when heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 through the air supply unit 140 , electric energy consumption of the heating unit 130 can be saved. A raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 , which is located outside the upper chamber 111 , is configured to be connected to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 to allow the raw coffee beans to be injected into the fluidizing chamber 120 from the outside. A coffee discharging unit 190 , which is disposed in the lower chamber 112 , is configured to be connected to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 so that roasted coffee can be discharged. As shown in FIG. 1 , the housing 110 that is a housing unit for providing an upper chamber 111 and a lower chamber 112 for the components to be installed, is configured such a way that frames of the upper chamber 111 and the lower chamber 112 are detachable by a cover panel so that installation and maintenance of the components is facilitated. In FIGS. 2 - 3 and 5 - 9 , it is shown that the fluidizing chamber 120 is a roasting chamber located in the upper chamber 111 that has a predetermined volume into which raw coffee beans are introduced, discharged, and roasted. The fluidizing chamber 120 includes a chamber body 121 having a rectangular cylindrical shape; an inclined surface 122 configured such a way that one side of a lower end of the chamber body 121 is inclined toward the other side of the lower end of the chamber body 121 ; an air inlet 123 , which is opened at the lower end of the chamber body 121 with a cross-sectional area of a smaller size than the cross-sectional area of the chamber body 121 and into which heated air is introduced from the air supply unit 140 ; a raw coffee bean inlet 124 , which is opened at the upper end of the chamber body 121 and through which raw coffee beans are injected into the chamber body 121 from the raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 ; a stirring plate 125 , which is formed in a position spaced apart from the other side, which is the opposite surface of the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 , into which heated air is introduced through the air inlet 123 so that, when the raw coffee beans injected into the vicinity of the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 are fluidized, an agitation layer of the raw coffee beans stacked inside the lower end of the chamber body 121 maintains an angle of repose that can be stabilized without collapsing to a predetermined height, thereby maximizing agitation and roasting effects; a diffusion slot 126 , which is located in the air inlet 123 and in which heated air flowing into the lower end of the chamber body 121 through the air inlet 123 is uniformly diffused into the interior of the chamber body 121 and simultaneously straightness is maintained, thereby uniformly fluidizing the raw coffee beans and maximizing stir-ability and roasting effects; an air outlet 127 , which is opened at one side of the upper end of the chamber body 121 and in which heated air introduced into the chamber body 121 is discharged to the dust collecting unit 160 ; and a coffee outlet 128 , which is formed to extend to an opening formed in the lower part of the inclined surface 122 at a predetermined angle and through which coffee roasted in the chamber body 121 is discharged to the outside. Here, the fluidizing chamber 120 enables the installation and configuration of the inclined surface 122 , the stirring plate 125 , and the diffusion slot 126 , etc., through the chamber body 121 having a rectangular cylindrical shape. Thus, it is not necessary to float the raw coffee beans as high as in a fluidized bed according to the related art, so that stir-ability can be improved using low air pressure and energy, and the diffusion of conductive heat between raw coffee beans is allowed, resulting in maximization of the roasting effects. On the other hand, preferably, the fluidizing chamber 120 further includes a penetration hole 129 , which is disposed at one side of the chamber body 121 and through which the roasting situation of the raw coffee beans can be observed with the naked eyes from the outside on one side of the chamber body 121 to visually observe the roasting state of raw coffee beans from the outside. In addition, as shown in FIGS. 7 - 9 , the fluidizing chamber 120 may further include an inclined plate 121 a for dropping, which allow the raw coffee beans to drop near the inclined surface 122 when the raw coffee beans are introduced from the raw coffee bean inlet 124 to the lower end of the chamber body 121 at the upper end of the chamber body 121 . After the raw coffee beans are concentrated near the inclined surface 122 by an inclined plate 121 a for dropping and the raw coffee beans on the opposite side of the inclined surface 122 are moved upward by the heated air flowing in through the air inlet 123 , the raw coffee beans are dropped into the inclined surface 122 in a higher position than the stirring plate 125 and thus, stir-ability can be enhanced. In addition, as shown in FIG. 8 , it is preferable that, in the fluidizing chamber 120 , a diffuser 121 b communicating with the heating unit 130 is configured at the air inlet 123 at the lower end of the chamber body 121 . Thus, according to the fluidizing chamber 120 , the inclined surface 122 is formed at the lower end of the chamber body 121 having the rectangular cylindrical body. A movement in which the raw coffee beans injected into the lower end of the inside of the chamber body 121 by the stirring plate 125 and the diffusion slot 126 configured in the air inlet 123 are moved upwards to a space between inner surfaces of the stirring plate 125 and the chamber body 121 from the lower end of the inclined surface 122 by heated air, and then dropped toward the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 again, is repeatedly made. Thus, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the raw coffee beans are roasted in a fluidized method, so that the raw coffee beans do not burn, and taste and aroma can be improved. Here, a distance from the other side of the chamber body 121 to the stirring plate 125 is preferably slightly greater than the diameter of the air inlet 123 in contact with the other side of the chamber body 121 . Thus, as the air introduced through the air inlet 123 having a small area spread toward the upper part of the chamber body 121 , the raw coffee beans are moved upward. In this case, the raw coffee beans moved to a higher position than the stirring plate 125 are repeatedly dropped to the inclined surface 122 , so that the raw coffee beans are more smoothly fluidized. In addition, preferably, the fluidizing chamber 120 is finished with a well-known insulating material in order to improve heat preservation. As illustrated in FIGS. 8 - 9 , the heating unit 130 is a unit configured in the lower chamber 112 that communicates with the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 so that the air introduced into the air inlet 123 is converted into heated air. Here, preferably, the heating unit 130 is finished with a known heat insulating material in order to improve heat preservation. As shown in FIG. 3 , the air supply unit 140 is located in the lower chamber 112 and is connected to the heating unit 130 . The air supply unit 140 is an air supply unit in which when external air inside the lower chamber 112 is heated by the heating unit 130 . The heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and is discharged to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 so that the raw coffee beans are circulated from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber 120 to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 and are roasted. The air supply unit 140 includes an air supply fan 141 for supplying external air inside the lower chamber 112 to the heating unit 130 communicating with the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 . Thus, according to the heating unit 130 and the air supply unit 140 , a unit for supplying air and a unit for heating the air are simply coupled to each other in a state in which each of the unit for supplying air and the unit for heating the air has a modular configuration, so that installation and maintenance can be facilitated. Here, preferably, a well-known noise suppresser for reducing driving noise is configured in the air supply fan 141 , and for example, it is preferable to reduce the driving noise of the air supply fan 141 to 70 dB or less. In FIG. 9 , the flow auxiliary unit 150 is shown as an auxiliary flow unit, which is configured to be connected from the air supply unit 140 to the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows the external air inside the lower chamber 112 to be directly sprayed to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 at a high speed so that when the raw coffee beans are heavy, the raw coffee beans flow together with the heated air. The flow auxiliary unit 150 includes a booster pipe 151 branching from a duct between the air supply fan 141 of the air supply unit 140 and the heating unit 130 to the air inlet 123 or the diffuser 121 b of the fluidizing chamber 120 , and an on/off valve 152 connected to the booster pipe 151 and electronically controlled. Therefore, according to the flow auxiliary unit 150 , when heated air through the heating unit 130 and the air supply unit 140 is introduced into the chamber body 121 , the raw coffee beans are heavy, and fluidizing of the raw coffee beans is not done well during fluidizing roasting of the raw coffee beans, selectively, the external air can be sprayed directly to the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the chamber body 121 at a high speed. Thus, the roasting effect of heavy raw coffee beans can be improved by the flow auxiliary unit 150 . In FIG. 2 , the dust collecting unit 160 is illustrated as a dust collecting unit, which is located in the upper chamber 111 , connected to the air outlet 127 of the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and which collects foreign substances in the exhaust air discharged to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 . The dust collecting unit 160 includes an air outlet pipe 161 communicating with the air outlet 127 of the chamber body 121 ; a dust collector 162 , which has a cylindrical structure and through which the air outlet pipe 161 is connected to the upper end of one side of the dust collector 162 and allows foreign substance having a high specific gravity to be dropped downwards when the exhaust air including the foreign substances is introduced; a foreign substance collector 163 , which communicates with the lower part of the dust collector 162 and in which foreign substances are collected; and an air moving pipe 164 , which extends from the upper end of the dust collector 162 to the heat exchanging unit 170 of the lower chamber 112 and allows only the exhaust air in which the foreign substances are dropped and removed from the dust collector 162 , to be moved to the heat exchanging unit 170 . As shown in FIG. 4 , the heat exchanging unit 170 is located in the lower chamber 112 , and communicates with the dust collecting unit 160 and provides a discharge flow path through which the exhaust air from which foreign substances discharged from the dust collecting unit 160 are removed is discharged to the outside of the lower chamber 112 . The heat exchanging unit 170 is a heat exchanging unit, which allows the external air of the lower chamber 112 to be heat-exchanged with the residual heat of the exhaust air, so that, when the heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 through the air supply unit 140 , electrical energy consumption of the heating unit 130 can be saved. The heat exchanging unit 170 includes a corrugated pipe 171 , which is located in the lower chamber 112 in a zigzag manner, has one end communicating with the air moving pipe 164 of the dust collecting unit 160 and allows the residual heat of the exhaust air moved from the dust collector 160 to be dispersed into the inner space of the lower chamber 112 and the external air inside the lower chamber 112 to be heat-exchanged at a predetermined temperature. An exhaust fan (not shown), which is connected to the other end of the corrugated pipe 171 , allows the exhaust air to move through the fluidizing chamber 120 , the dust collector 160 and the corrugated pipe 171 to be discharged to the outside. Thus, according to the heat exchanging unit 170 , the external air flowing into the inside of the fluting chamber 120 from the inside of the lower chamber 112 due to the residual heat of the heated air discharged to the outside of the fluidizing chamber 120 is heat-exchanged so that the electric energy of the heating unit 130 can be saved. That is, according to the heat exchanging unit 170 , when the external air at room temperature is required to be preheated to 70° C. to 80° C. and heated to 250° C. to 300° C. through the heating unit 130 , electrical energy can be greatly saved. In addition, preferably, the upper chamber 111 and the lower chamber 112 have a structure that is separated and sealed from each other through a partition wall. Thus, a greenhouse function provided to the lower chamber 112 by the heat exchanging unit 170 may be maximized. The raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 is a raw coffee bean injecting unit, which is located outside the upper chamber 111 , is connected to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows the raw coffee beans to be injected into the fluidizing chamber 120 from the outside. As shown in FIGS. 1 , 2 and 3 , the coffee discharging unit 190 is a coffee discharging unit, which is configured in the lower chamber 112 and connected to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows roasted coffee to be discharged. Hereinafter, the operation of the coffee roaster according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. First, a predetermined amount of raw coffee beans is injected into the fluidizing chamber 120 through the raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 . Here, in the fluidizing chamber 120 , as the inclined surface 122 is formed at the lower end of the chamber body 121 , the density of raw coffee beans at the lower end of the chamber body 121 is higher than the density of raw coffee beans at the upper end of the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 . Thereafter, heated air having a predetermined temperature is sprayed and introduced into the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the chamber body 121 by the air supply unit 140 and the heating unit 130 . Thereafter, a movement in which the raw coffee beans injected into the lower end of the inside of the chamber body 121 by the stirring plate 125 positioned on the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 and the diffusion slot 126 configured in the air inlet 123 , are moved upwards into a space between inner surfaces of the stirring plate 125 and the chamber body 121 from the lower end of the inclined surface 122 by the heated air and then dropped to the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 again, is repeatedly made so that the raw coffee beans are roasted in a fluidized method and then discharged to the outside through the coffee discharging unit 190 . On the other hand, the heated air introduced into the lower end of the chamber body 121 is moved along the heat exchanging unit 170 of the lower chamber 112 including the air supply unit 140 and the heating unit 130 via the dust collecting unit 160 so that the external air in the lower chamber 112 is heat-exchanged to a predetermined temperature by residual heat of the exhaust air and the electric energy of the heating unit 130 can be saved when heating air is supplied to the chamber body 121 . In addition, as the flow auxiliary unit 150 is connected from the air supply unit 140 to the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 , the external air is directly sprayed into the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 at high speed, and even if the raw coffee beans are heavy, the fluidizing of the raw coffee beans can be improved and thus, the roasting effects can be improved. Therefore, according to the above description, heated air is supplied and discharged from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber 120 having a cylindrical structure into which raw coffee beans are injected, to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 , and the raw coffee beans are circulated (fluidized) from the lower part to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 and roasted, thereby roasting while maximizing the characteristics of the raw coffee beans without burning the raw coffee beans. In addition, the fluidity of the raw coffee beans is maintained even when the raw coffee beans are heavy by high-speed spraying of external air through the flow auxiliary unit 150 into the lower part of the fluidizing chamber 120 , thereby maximizing fluidized roasting. In addition, the external air supplied to the fluidizing chamber 120 through the heat exchanging unit 170 is heat-exchanged with the heated air discharged from the fluidizing chamber 120 so that the electrical energy of the heating unit 130 can be saved. Accordingly, according to the present invention, heated air is supplied and discharged from a lower part of a fluidizing chamber to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber having a cylindrical structure in which raw coffee beans are injected and the raw coffee beans are circulated (fluidized) from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber and roasted, thereby enabling roasting that maximizes the characteristics of the raw coffee beans while the raw coffee beans do not burn. In addition, external air is sprayed into the lower part of the fluidizing chamber at a high speed so that the fluidity of the raw coffee beans is maintained even when the raw coffee beans are heavy, thereby enabling fluidized roasting. In addition, external air in which heated air discharged to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber is supplied to the lower part of the fluidizing chamber, is preheated so that the electric energy of a heating unit can be saved. While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.","20230165292"

No. 61/188,595 filed Aug. 11, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to beverages and more particularly to an apparatus and method for creating a flash frozen coffee beverage. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various coffee-based drinks are available such as cappuccino, espresso, flavored-coffees, and regular coffee. Some drinks are served chilled, some hot, and some with extra ingredients and toppings as well. Regardless of the way most coffee-based drinks are served, they typically start out as coffee beans that are brewed, steamed, roasted, or processed at the location where the drink is being served. Keeping coffee beans fresh is important to maintaining the flavor and aroma of drinks made using those beans. There are many techniques that have previously been used to try to maintain the freshness of coffee beans. While vacuum packing and other packaging are known techniques, it is also well known that freezing coffee beans appears to help maintain their freshness. However, enjoying a fresh tasting coffee drink requires either a laborious process at home using consumer-quality equipment or traveling to a coffee specialty shop where commercial-grade equipment can produce a quality drink but often at a hefty price. There remains the need, therefore, for a product and method of its manufacture and use which allows quality coffee flavored drinks to be easily and affordably produced by a typical consumer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of flash freezing a coffee-based liquid into small beads and then packaging the beads for consumers. The beads are stored in a conventional freezer until desired and then reconstituted into a coffee beverage base as needed. In particular, a cold coffee-based beverage may be easily and affordably created using the frozen beads.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the invention and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the invention. As a result of the methods described herein, there are provided formulations of frozen coffee-based beverages in the form of small particulate shapes that remain free-flowing during storage and which can be used alone or in combination to be reconstituted into various coffee-based beverages. The particulate shapes, generally referred to as “beads”, may have a generally spherical, spheroid shape but may also have an oblong, elliptical, oblate, tubular, or other slightly irregular shape. In addition to having an irregular overall shape, the surface of the particulate shape may also be either smooth or irregular (e.g. bumpy, pocked, etc.). On average, the particulate shapes will preferably have a diameter of about 5 mm or less but can also be larger such as between about 6 and about 10 mm. Particulate shapes having diameters outside these ranges are also contemplated. For non-spherical shapes which do not have a conventional diameter, the diameter is considered to be the diameter of the smallest sphere into which the particulate shape would fit. It is desired that the particulate or beaded product is in a free-flowing format so that it is readily pourable or spoonable. Free-flowing, as used herein, is a broad term which includes the ability of the product to flow as individual particulate shapes, with little or no clumping or sticking to each other, during such pouring or spooning. There may be slight sticking after a period of storage, but a light tap on the container will unstick the particulate shapes and allow them to be free flowing. The generally spherical shape helps contribute to the free-flowing, pourable product. FIG. 1 shows a cryogenic processor constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention to produce free-flowing beads 56 . A cryogenic processor 10 includes a freezing chamber 12 that is most preferably in the form of a conical tank that holds a liquid refrigerant therein. A freezing chamber 12 incorporates an inner shell 14 and an outer shell 16 . Insulation 18 is disposed between the inner shell 14 and outer shell 16 in order to increase the thermal efficiency of the chamber 12 . Vents 20 are also provided to ventilate the insulated area formed between the shells 14 and 16 . The freezing chamber 12 is a free-standing unit supported by legs 22 . A refrigerant 24 , preferably liquid nitrogen, enters the freezing chamber 12 by means of refrigerant inlet 26 . The refrigerant 24 is introduced into a chamber 12 through the inlet 26 in order to maintain a predetermined level of liquid refrigerant in the freezing chamber because some refrigerant 24 can be lost by evaporation or by other means incidental to production. Gaseous refrigerant that has evaporated from the surface of the liquid refrigerant 24 in freezing chamber 12 primarily vents to the atmosphere through exit port 29 which cooperates with the vacuum assembly 30 , which can be in the form of a venturi nozzle. Extraction of the frozen beads occurs through product outlet 32 adapted at the base of the freezing chamber 12 . An ambient air inlet port 28 with adjustment doors 38 and exit port 29 with adjustment doors 39 are provided to adjust the level of gaseous refrigerant which evaporates from the surface of the liquid refrigerant 24 so that excessive pressure is not built up within the processor 10 and freezing of the liquid composition in the feed assembly 40 does not occur. A feed tray 48 receives liquid composition from a delivery source 50 . Typically, a pump (not shown) drives the liquid composition through a delivery tube 52 into the feed tray 48 . A premixing device 54 allows several compositions, not all of which must be liquid, such as powdered flavorings or other additives of a size small enough not to cause clogging in the feed assembly 40 , to be mixed in predetermined concentrations for delivery to the feed tray 48 . In order to create uniformly sized particles or beads 56 of frozen product, uniformly sized droplets of liquid composition are desirable that are to be fed through gas diffusion chamber 46 to freezing chamber 12 . The feed tray 48 is designed with feed assembly 40 that forms droplets of the desired character. The frozen product takes the form of beads that are formed when the droplets of liquid composition contact the refrigerant vapor in the gas diffusion chamber 46 , and subsequently the liquid refrigerant 24 in the freezing chamber 12 . After the beads 56 are formed, they fall or are mechanically directed to the bottom of chamber 12 . A transport system connects to the bottom of chamber 12 at outlet 32 to carry the beads 56 to a packaging and distribution network for later delivery and consumption. The vacuum assembly 30 cooperates with air inlet 28 and adjustment doors 38 so that ambient air flows through the inlet and around feed assembly 40 to ensure that no liquid composition freezes therein. This is accomplished by mounting the vacuum assembly 30 and air inlet 28 on opposing sides of the gas diffusion chamber 46 such that the incoming ambient air drawn by the vacuum assembly 30 is aligned with the feed assembly. In this configuration, ambient air flows around the feed assembly warming it to a sufficient temperature to inhibit the formation of frozen liquid composition in the feed assembly flow channels. An air source 60 , typically in the form of an air compressor, is attached to vacuum assembly 30 to provide appropriate suction to create the ambient air flow desired. In accordance with preferred embodiments, there are provided formulations of frozen coffee flavored confections in the form of small particulate shapes. The particulate shapes may have a generally spherical, spheroid shape as shown in FIG. 2 (e.g., 1001 , 1003 , 1005 ), but may also have an oblong, elliptical, oblate, tubular, or other slightly irregular shape as also shown in FIG. 2 (e.g., 1007 , 1009 ). In addition to having an irregular overall shape, the surface of the particulate shape may also be either smooth or irregular (e.g. bumpy, pocked, etc.). On average, the particulate shapes will preferably have a diameter of about 0.05 inch to about 0.5 inch or less, including 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.25 inch, 0.2 inch, 0.15 inch, and about 0.1 inch, and ranges including and bordered by these dimensions. Particulate shapes having diameters outside these ranges are also contemplated. For non-spherical shapes which do not have a conventional diameter, the diameter is to be the diameter of the smallest sphere into which the particulate shape would fit. As mentioned earlier, it is desired that the beaded product is in a free-flowing format so that it is readily pourable or spoonable. Free-flowing, as used herein, is a broad term which includes the ability of the product to flow as individual particulate shapes, with little or no clumping or sticking to each other, during such pouring or spooning. There may be slight sticking after a period of storage, but a light tap on the container will unstick the particulate shapes and allow them to be free flowing. The generally spherical shape helps contribute to the free-flowing, pourable product. In preferred embodiments, particulate shapes that can be stored at higher temperatures, such as in a home freezer or in a grocery dairy freezer are provided, such particulate shapes being able to maintain a free-flowing form while being stored at a temperature between about −10° F. and 0° F. with an occasional rise to perhaps as much as +5° F. One way to accomplish this is to increase the freezing point (reduce the freeze-point depression) of the liquid formulation that forms the particulate shapes, although other ways may also be used. FIG. 3 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method of making a coffee-based particulate beads in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The first step 302 shown in FIG. 3 is that of preparing the coffee-based liquid. While the base ingredient of this liquid is coffee, there are a number of additional ingredients and flavors that may be added as well during the preparation process, in accordance with other embodiments. Dairy products, flavored syrups, flavored oils, sugars, sweeteners, herbs, spices and the like may be added, for example in a raw form or pre-processed form. In preparing the coffee-based liquid, the coffee may be brewed, steamed or pressed to have a particular strength, caffeine content, or other desired characteristic. Also, flavors from various liqueurs and syrups, as well as the ingredients listed above, may be part of the formulation as well, either before or after the coffee-based liquid is prepared. The number of various formulations that may be turned into coffee-based liquids in accordance with the principles of the present invention are limited only by the creativity of the food scientist and the preferences of consumers. As is known, coffee-based liquids may be prepared by various brewing methods as well as alternative methods as well. For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the coffee-based liquid is substantially traditional espresso. Espresso is prepared from dark, roasted coffee beans that are first ground to a desired size. Then water at around 195 to 200° F. is forced through the finely ground coffee at between 9-15 bars of pressure. The resulting coffee-based liquid has a highly concentrated coffee flavor. Once the liquid is prepared, another opportunity exists, at step 304 , to add additional flavors, ingredients or additives in order to formulate a variety of different coffee-based liquids. In step 306 , the coffee-based liquid is cooled. The cooling can be accomplished by a variety of different methods that are well known. Preferably the coffee-based liquid is cooled to about 40° F. in a matter of minutes or less. While as low a temperature as possible is desirable to improve the efficiency of later cryogenic processing, the temperature to which the liquid is cooled depends on the desired viscosity of the liquid as it is transported through to later stages of processing. Thus, additives may be included, such as stabilizers, that allow cooling to lower temperatures while ensuring the liquid easily flows and improve the liquids freezing characteristics. The coffee-based liquid is transported such as by being pumped, in step 308 , to a frozen bead-making apparatus such as, for example, the device shown and described earlier with respect to FIG. 1. As mentioned, the consistency of the liquid may be adjusted to accommodate the pump 50 and the temperature of the liquid may be adjusted as well by well known cooling techniques that can be applied during transport to the freezing apparatus. The temperature and consistency may also adjusted to help the development of uniformly-sized beads within the freezing apparatus. Depending on the viscosity of the original fluid, different temperatures and consistencies may be used for different liquids that are dispensed into the freezing apparatus. The next step, 310 , is to freeze the coffee-based liquid into beads as described with respect to FIG. 1. These beads can then be transported to a packaging machine. The transporting of the beads can be accomplished in a variety of different ways such as by a feed screw, a moving conveyor belt, or gravity feed. The transporting means can also be cooled such that the beads remain cool while being transported to the packager. In general, the entire process from the grinding of the coffee beans to the packaging and storing of the beads can be accomplished in a time-frame measured in minutes and is, preferably accomplished in less than 10 minutes. In this way, a flash-frozen coffee-based product is produced that can be easily reconstituted to make a fresh tasting coffee beverage. However, process times greater than or less than 10 minutes may be desirable in some embodiments and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. Using the example embodiment described above, the resulting coffee-based frozen particulate beads can have a relatively highly concentrated coffee flavor. Alternatively, the coffee-based liquid that is fed through the cryogenic process may be freshly brewed coffee instead of espresso. FIG. 4 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method of producing frozen beads using brewed coffee. The steps are substantially the same as the steps described with respect to FIG. 3. In step 402 , the coffee-based liquid is prepared such as by brewing coffee using known techniques and then additional flavors or additives can be incorporated in step 404 . If necessary, the resulting liquid can then be cooled in step 406 , transported to a cryogenic processor, in step 408 , where it is flash frozen into beads, in step 410 . Once flash frozen, the beads can then be packaged, in step 412 , and stored. The brewed coffee liquid may have a consistency and viscosity that is not optimal for transporting and freezing. For example, the water content may be too high for efficient bead formation and freezing. Additionally, the ultimate beverage that results when the beads are reconstituted may require so many beads to have the desired coffee flavor that the product is unappealing. Thus, in step 406 , the coffee-based liquid may be concentrated by extracting a portion of the water as it is cooled. The resulting liquid may therefore have a stronger coffee flavor and be easier to freeze into relatively uniform beads. However, using original strength brewed coffee is contemplated as well. One of ordinary skill will recognize that different flavored beads may be frozen in separate freezing apparatuses at the same time or in the same freezing apparatus in a sequential manner. These different flavor beads can then be combined in different ratios at the packaging machine. In this way, different combinations of flavored coffee-based beverages may be created using the same set of beads in various permutations and combinations. Of course, a product consisting of one type of flavored bead is contemplated. Once the beads are packaged and delivered to a consumer such as an individual, a coffee shop, a store, or a restaurant, the beads are stored in a conventional freezer until they are used to make a beverage. Although the beads are frozen at cryogenic temperatures, there is no requirement that they remain cooled to temperatures as low as −40° F. but, instead, may be maintained at the standard operating temperatures of commercial and consumer freezers. However, storing them at even lower temperatures may allow using less of the beads to cool a beverage to a desired temperature. In addition to the espresso beads and the brewed coffee beads discussed above, embodiments of the present invention also contemplate coffee-flavored beads as well that more closely resemble flash frozen ice cream products. These beads have a less concentrated coffee flavor than beads made substantially from brewed coffee or espresso. Thus, in addition to coffee-based beverages being obtainable, beverages having more subtle coffee flavor are also possible. Instead of espresso or brewed coffee being the liquid or slurry that is flash frozen, a coffee-flavored mixture as described below is flash frozen to form beads having coffee flavor (and additional flavors if desired). For any of the types of beads discussed, the apparatus and method of FIG. 1 may used as well as other cryogenic freezing processes. An exemplary method of manufacturing the coffee-flavored frozen food product, includes preparing a formulation, wherein the formulation is preferably made by combining liquid ingredients, combining dry powders, and mixing the combined dry powders with the combined liquids to make the formulation, and where the method continues by agitating the formulation, pasteurizing the formulation, homogenizing the formulation, aging the formulation, and dripping the formulation into a cryogenic processor to form a particulate frozen food product. In a preferred embodiment, the homogenizing step acts to synchronize the pasteurizing step. In certain embodiments, based on the ingredients of the formulation, the pasteurizing step may be omitted. Also, one or more of the other steps in the above list may be optional depending on the formulation and desired end product. One example of a formulation for a coffee-flavored frozen food product, includes water and total solids, wherein the food product may include, in addition to coffee flavor, 6-14% by weight milk fat, 4-24% by weight non-fat milk solids, and 2.6-8% by weight sugar. In preferred products the product is in the form of particulate shapes which remain free-flowing when stored in a freezer at 0° F. In certain embodiments, the food product further includes one or more of the following: 0.1-0.4% by weight sweetener; 1-20% by weight bulking agent; 0.1-1% by weight of cryoprotectant; one or more natural and/or artificial flavors; and 1-4% combined stabilizer/emulsifier. In certain embodiments, the product may have at least about 29% by weight total solids and less than about 71% by weight water allowing the product to remain free flowing when stored in a freezer at 0° F. Preferred bulking agents include, but are not limited to, maltodextrins. As stated, it is desired to store the particulate shapes within a conventional freezer and yet still maintain their free-flowing properties. To achieve this, various sample liquid formulations used in making the particulate shapes will now be described some which are dairy based and some which are not. It should be noted that the formulations described below are only examples, and numerous other formulations containing various amounts of ingredients as described herein may be made. Some of the components of three different example formulation types are as follows (all percentages are by weight of the total formulation): Ingredient Formulation I Formulation II Formulation III Milk fat (butterfat) 9-11% 6-14% Non-fat milk solids 4-12% 4-20% Maltodextrins (or other 0-20% 0-20% 0-10% bulking agent) Sugar 15-17% 2.6-8% 2-10% sweetener (artificial) <0.4% <0.8% combined <1% (if <4% (if <1% (stabilizer stabilizer/emulsifier present) present) only) total solids >=35.5% >=29.7% Water (coffee flavor) <=63.5% <=70.3% 70-96% The freezing point of the various formulations disclosed herein which form the particulate shapes can be increased by making adjustments to one or more of the above components, and some adjustments work better in combination with each other. As shown above, some of the formulations above comprise various total solids combined with water. Within the particulate shapes, water is present both as a liquid and as a solid. This is because not all water freezes, due to the presence of dissolved solutes and the cryogenic freezing itself. The solid/liquid ratio within the particulate shapes affects their firmness. This in turn affects pourability and the ability of the particulate shapes to remain free-flowing. Other factors may affect the pourability, including, but not limited to, size of the ice crystals, freezing point, melting point, glass transition temperature, presence or absence of devitrification, storage temperature and conditions. In the United States, the total solids content must be 35.55% to legally describe a product as ice cream. Accordingly, formulations according to formulation I are considered ice creams in the U.S. This is because most ice creams finished ice cream product must weight at least 4.5 lb/gal and must contain at least 1.6 lb of food solids or total solids per gallon, which essentially equates to a minimum total food solids of 35.5%. In the USA, any finished product below these limits cannot be labeled ice cream. However, other countries have different requirements. For example, in several countries other than the U.S. the total solids content of a formulation can be as low as 29.7%, and possibly lower, yet still be labeled ice cream. Accordingly, formulations according to Formulation II preferably have solids at a level that is considered ice cream in jurisdictions outside the U.S. Therefore, in certain preferred embodiments, the total solids in a frozen confection is at least about 25%, at least about 26%, at least about 26.5%, at least about 27%, at least about 27.5%, at least about 28%, at least about 28.5%, at least about 29%, at least about 30%, at least about 31%, at least about 32%, at least about 33%, at least about 34%, at least about 35%, at least about 36%, or at least about 37%, wherein stated percentages are by weight of the weight of the total formulation including water. One component of the solids of dairy formulations such as those according to Formulae I and II is milkfat. The milkfat, also called butterfat, in the composition provides much of the creamy texture and body to the formulation, with higher levels providing greater creaminess and richness. Serum solids or nonfat milk solids are those components of milk and/or cream which are water soluble, including but not limited to caseins and other milk proteins. It is to be noted that although milkfat and water are listed as separate ingredients, milkfat, water and serum solids are, in most embodiments, included in the milks and creams that form the basis of the dairy Formulations I and II, and thus do not necessarily comprise separate ingredients. Nonfat milk solids enhance the texture of ice cream, aid in giving body and chew resistance, and may be less expensive than milkfat. Whey solids, including modified whey products, may also be substituted for nonfat milk solids but, under USA federal government requirements, not for more than 25% of the total nonfat milk solids in the overall formulation. Egg yolk can also be used as another source of solids. Accordingly, in one embodiment, preferably about 1% to 25%, including 5% to 20% and 10% to 15% of the nonfat milk solids in a formulation comprise whey solids and/or egg yolk solids. Emulsifiers can also be included within the various formulations, especially those containing milkfat. Preferred emulsifiers can include monoglycerides, diglycerides, and polysorbates. Stabilizers may be included within the various formulations. Stabilizers assist in controlling the viscosity of the formulations, with more stabilizer generally providing increased viscosity, especially in those embodiments having lower amounts of fats and solids. The viscosity affects the drip rate of the formulation while it is formed. Within the dairy Formulations I and II, preferred stabilizers can include guar, carrageenan, LBG, and/or CMC. Within the non-dairy Formulation III, a preferred stabilizer can include cellulose gum. In those dairy embodiments where both stabilizers and emulsifiers are used, the formulations disclosed herein for making the frozen confection includes a combined stabilizer/emulsifier, and the recited amounts are the combined total of the stabilizer and emulsifier present. The combined stabilizer/emulsifier need not actually be added as a single ingredient when making the formulation; the weights of these two materials are included together because in many embodiments, commercial combined stabilizer/emulsifier formulations are used, which include one or more stabilizers and one or more emulsifiers. Accordingly, the stabilizer/emulsifier may be a commercial or proprietary formulation or it may be a combination or series of one or more stabilizers and/or one or more emulsifiers added to the formulation. One or more bulking agents may also be added to formulations according to certain embodiments. Bulking agents include high molecular weight polymeric compounds (such as polysaccharides), which add viscosity and bulk to foods. Preferred bulking agents include, but are not limited to polydextrose, dextrans, corn syrup solids, and maltodextrins. In certain preferred embodiments, maltodextrins are used, including, but not limited to, those having a DE of 5, 10, 15, and 20, where DE refers to “dextrose equivalent”. In a preferred embodiment, the total amount of bulking agents is 1% to 20% by weight, including 1%-15% by weight, 5%-15% by weight, including 6%, 8%, 10% and 12% by weight. Because bulking agents and stabilizers both contribute to the viscosity of a formulation, formulations containing a bulking agent may or may not include a stabilizer or stabilizer/emulsifier. The ultimate use for the frozen beads is to use them to produce a beverage for consumption. This can be accomplished in a variety of different ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, for warm beverages, the frozen beads may be brewed or steamed to reconstitute them much like coffee beans. The frozen beads may also be ground similar to regular coffee beans and used to make espresso and other similar beverages. However, another benefit of the frozen beads is that they may be used or mixed to create cold coffee-based drinks while reducing or eliminating the need for ice cubes. Thus, the resulting beverage is not as watered-down as if ice cubes are used to make the cold drink. Also, because of the freezing method, ice crystal formation will be different than if ice cubes are used which improves the mouth-feel of the resulting beverage. Milk, water and other liquids may be used when reconstituting the frozen beads into the desired beverage. A combination of any or just some of the brewed coffee beads, the espresso beads, and the coffee-flavor beads can be formulated in order to achieve a desired coffee flavor strength for a variety of different cold drinks. Accordingly, the packaging of the frozen beads can be accomplished in a variety of different ways depending on the desired product. For example, the beads may be packed in a cup sized container that is for a single serving. For example, 8 oz. of beads (whatever variety or combination) may be packaged in a cup with room for 8 oz. of milk (or other liquid) to be added. Additional room can be provided in order to accommodate other additional flavors and confections. Alternatively, the beads can be packaged in bulk packages from which a user can extract the desired amount of product to be reconstituted. Utilizing the espresso beads, brewed coffee beads, and the coffee flavored beads described earlier, various ingredients can be added to create any of the well known cold coffee beverages currently available and those to be created in the future. In general, a flowchart is shown in FIG. 5 of a method for making a coffee drink from the frozen beads described earlier. In step 502 , the desired amount of beads are acquired. While these beads can be any of the flash-frozen coffee-based, or coffee-flavored beads as described earlier, using the coffee-flavored beads will allow more subtle coffee flavors to be created which can always be augmented by other more strongly flavored beads. Depending on the desired beverage and the type of beads, the amount of beads selected in step 502 will vary. The ingredients that will be combined with this coffee beverage base can vary widely. For example, milk, frothed milk, steamed milk, cream, and whipped cream are all likely candidates to add so as to make a variety of cold coffee-based beverages. Furthermore, the milk can vary from 1%, 2%, skim, lowfat, whole, and untraditional milk products such as soy, rice, goat, and the like. These additional ingredients can also includes syrups and flavors such as those traditionally paired with coffee such as chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut, Irish creme, caramel, peppermint, butter rum, mint, coffee liqueur, and others. In cold coffee beverages fruity flavors, soda water, and ice can be added as well. Thus, in step 504 , the additional ingredients are prepared in a manner appropriate for addition to the coffee beverage base and then everything is combined in step 506 to create a cold coffee beverage. In step 508 , the strength of the coffee flavor in the cold beverage can be increased by adding either espresso beads or brewed coffee beads as desired by the user. As an example recipe, 8 oz. of coffee-flavored beads can be combined with 8 oz. of milk to yield a cold coffee drink of about 16 oz. The beads and milk can, for example, be combined by shaking or using a blender. The resulting beverage can be garnished with additional ingredients such as whipped cream, chocolate sauce, or caramel sauce.

No. 17/176,241, filed Feb. 16, 2021, which claims the benefit of, and priority to, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/977,765, filed Feb. 18, 2020. The entire contents of each of the above applications are hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to coffee brewing and, more specifically, a method of producing a flash brewed coffee concentrate. 2. Discussion of Related Art Cold brew coffee is gaining popularity amongst consumers for its unique flavor profile in a cold coffee beverage. Unfortunately, the process to prepare cold brew coffee in a manner in which a full range of flavors result can be a time consuming, and labor intensive process is required. Some cold brew coffee processes can take between six and twenty-four hours. One method of brewing coffee that is gaining popularity is a method of brewing known as “Japanese Pour Over.” In Japanese Pour Over, coffee is brewed with hot water, and then poured directly onto ice. The Japanese Pour Over brewing method allows for a quick extraction of flavor from coffee grounds and followed by rapid cooling to lock in the flavors and volatile aromatics. The Japanese Pour Over brewing method forms cold coffee with a full range of flavors that takes less time to brew than traditional cold brew methods. While the Japanese Pour Over brewing method may be suitable for gourmet coffee shops or in the home, it is not suitable for producing coffee on a commercial scale. For example, the Japanese Pour Over brewing method produces a ready-to-drink coffee that cannot be packed, stored, and transported for commercial use that requires an extended shelf-life. SUMMARY This disclosure relates generally to a method of forming a flash brewed coffee concentrate that produces a coffee extract having aromas and flavors similar to the Japanese Pour Over brewing method. The flash brewed coffee concentrate, once concentrated, may have an extended shelf-life that allows for packing, storing, and transporting of the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of brewing a flash brewed coffee concentrate includes flash brewing ground coffee to brew a hot coffee extract and mixing the hot coffee extract with a frozen concentrated coffee extract to chill the hot coffee extract to a temperature less than 130° F. while increasing the concentration of the hot coffee extract to form the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In embodiments, the method includes coarsely grinding roasted coffee beans to form the ground coffee before flash brewing the ground coffee. The method may include roasting the coffee beans to a 66 or less on the Agtron degree of roast scale before grinding the roasted coffee beans. The coffee beans may be roasted for at least seven minutes at a temperature of at least 388° F. In some embodiments, flash brewing the ground coffee brews the hot coffee extract having a concentration in a range of 3° Brix to 12° Brix. Mixing the hot coffee extract with the frozen concentrated coffee extract may increase the concentration of the hot coffee extract to greater than 15° Brix to form the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In certain embodiments, flash brewing the ground coffee includes brewing the ground coffee in a range of 5 to 25 minutes in water having a temperature in a range of 165° F. to 205° F. The method may include thawing the frozen concentrated coffee extract before mixing with the hot coffee extract. Thawing the frozen concentrated coffee extract may include thawing the frozen concentrated coffee extract to a temperature equal to or less than 41° F. In particular embodiments, mixing the hot coffee extract with the frozen concentrated coffee extract includes adding the frozen concentrated coffee extract to a mixing kettle and adding the hot coffee extract to the mixing kettle after the frozen concentrated coffee extract is within the mixing kettle. Adding the frozen concentrated coffee extract may include pumping a slurry of the frozen concentrated coffee extract into the mixing kettle. In embodiments, the method may include heating the flash brewed coffee concentrate after mixing and chilling the flash brewed coffee concentrate to a temperature of less than 45° F. after heating. Heating the flash brewed coffee concentrate may include heating the flash brewed coffee concentrate to a temperature less than 190° F., e.g., to a temperature in a range of 110° F. to 185° F. The method may include agitating the flash brewed coffee concentrate during heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In some embodiments, the method may include using the flash brewed coffee concentrate to produce a ready-to-drink or a ready-to-serve product. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of brewing a flash brewed coffee concentrate includes flash brewing a hot coffee extract and mixing the hot coffee extract with a frozen concentrated coffee extract to form a flash brewed coffee concentrate. The flash brewed coffee concentrate has a concentration that is greater than a concentration of the hot coffee extract. In embodiments, flash brewing the hot coffee extract brews the hot coffee extract with a concentration less than 15° Brix and wherein mixing the hot coffee extract with the frozen concentrated coffee extract forms the flash brewed coffee concentrate with a concentration greater than 15° Brix. Flash brewing the hot coffee extract brews the hot coffee extract with a concentration in a range of 3° Brix to 12° Brix and wherein mixing the hot coffee extract with the frozen concentrated coffee extract form the flash brewed coffee concentrate with a concentration greater than 15° Brix. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of brewing a flash brewed coffee concentrate includes roasting coffee beans to a 66 or less on the Agtron scale, grinding the roasted coffee beans to produce ground coffee, flash brewing the ground coffee in water having a temperature in a range of 165° F. to 205° F. for a range of 5 to 25 minutes to brew a hot coffee extract having a concentration of less than 15° Brix, mixing the hot coffee extract with a frozen concentrated coffee extract to chill the hot coffee extract to a temperature of less than 130° F. and to form a flash brewed coffee concentrate having a concentration of greater than 15° Brix, heating the flash brewed coffee concentrate after mixing to a temperature less than 190° F., and chilling the heated flash brewed coffee concentrate to a temperature of less than 45° F. Further, to the extent consistent, any of the embodiments or aspects described herein may be used in conjunction with any or all of the other embodiments or aspects described herein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to example embodiments thereof with reference to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. These example embodiments are described so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Features from one embodiment or aspect can be combined with features from any other embodiment or aspect in any appropriate combination. For example, any individual or collective features of method aspects or embodiments can be applied to apparatus, product, or component aspects or embodiments and vice versa. The disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” “the,” and the like include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In addition, while reference may be made herein to quantitative measures, values, geometric relationships or the like, unless otherwise stated, any one or more if not all of these may be absolute or approximate to account for acceptable variations that may occur, such as those due to manufacturing tolerances or engineering tolerances or the like. Referring now to FIGS. 1 - 6 , a method of producing a flash brewed coffee concentrate that has an extended shelf-life that allows for packing, storing, and transporting of the flash brewed coffee concentrate is disclosed herein and generally referred to as method 100 . The flash brewed coffee concentrate that is produced from the method 100 is formed from a high-quality coffee that is quickly brewed with hot water and quickly chilled to stop the brewing process such that the brightness and complexity of the coffee is captured in the coffee extract. As used herein, the term “extract” refers to a product or essence removed from a larger whole. Further, as used herein, the term “coffee concentrate” refers to a brewed and concentrated coffee product that requires further processing before being considered ready-to-serve or ready-to-drink. A coffee concentrate, as described herein, may be ultra-high-temperature (UHT) or aseptically packed before being distributed for use. In addition, a coffee concentrate, as described herein may be processed by further dilution before being distributed. For example, a coffee concentrate may be at 15° Brix such that it is a 1+7 dilution (1-part concentrate+7 parts water, milk, or non-dairy beverage) to make a ready to drink product and be processed by diluting the coffee concentrate to 9° Brix and distributed as a 1+3 dilution. Initially, the method 100 includes roasting the coffee beans (Step 120 ). With particular reference to FIG. 2 , before the coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ), green coffee beans 10 (FIG. 6 ) are selected, procured, or received (Step 112 ). Once the green coffee beans are received (Step 112 ), the green coffee beans are cleaned (Step 114 ). Cleaning the green coffee beans (Step 114 ) may include the use of screens 12 (FIG. 6 ) and magnets 14 (FIG. 6 ) to remove impurities from the green coffee beans. Once the green coffee beans are cleaned (Step 114 ), the green coffee beans may be blended (Step 116 ). For example, the green coffee beans may be blended using a thru blend scale 16 (FIG. 6 ). In some embodiments, green coffee beans from specific regions may be blended to achieve a desired flavor profile in the extract ultimately produced from the method 100 . Once the green coffee beans are cleaned and blended, the green coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ). The green coffee beans may be roasted in a coffee roaster 20 (FIG. 6 ) until the beans are at or below 66 on the Agtron degree of roast scale. For example, the green coffee beans may be roasted in a range of 25 to 60 on the Agtron degree of roast scale. To achieve the desired roast, the green coffee beans may be roasted at a minimum temperature of 388° F. for a minimum 7 minutes. The roasting time may vary depending on the degree of roast desired. Referring now to FIG. 3 , once the coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ), the roasted coffee beans are ground (Step 130 ). The roasted coffee beans may be coarsely ground, e.g., a chunky grind, in a coffee grinder 30 (FIG. 6 ). Between roasting (Step 120 ) and grinding (Step 130 ), the roasted coffee beans may pass through several quality control and/or safety steps such as destoning (Step 122 ) or passing the roasted coffee beans past magnets, e.g., rare earth magnets 32 (FIG. 6 ). The steps 122 may remove impurities from the roasted coffee beans before grinding. Removing impurities from the roasted coffee beans may prevent impurities in the extract ultimately produced from method 100 and/or prevent damage to equipment used to grind the coffee beans and equipment downstream thereof. In addition, after the roasted coffee beans are ground (Step 130 ), the ground coffee may be screened (Step 132 ) to ensure that the ground coffee is satisfactorily ground. The screening (Step 132 ) may also remove small granules of coffee from the grinding process and/or impurities from the ground coffee. For example, the screening (Step 132 ) may have a first screen 34 (FIG. 6 ) that requires the ground coffee to pass through and a second screen 36 (FIG. 6 ), having a finer mesh, that prevents the desired ground coffee from passing through. The screening subsequent to grinding (Step 132 ) may ensure a relative uniformity of the ground coffee. With reference to FIG. 4 , the ground coffee is then flash brewed (Step 140 ) to bring out the brightness/acidity and complexity of the coffee without drawing out bitter/astringent notes of the coffee. The flash brewing process (Step 140 ) may use a single-wall stainless steel vessel 40 (FIG. 6 ) with an open top that is covered by a separate stainless-steel cover 42 (FIG. 6 ). In some embodiments, the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) occurs at atmospheric pressure such that the brewer is not a pressurized brewer. The ground coffee may be placed into a nylon filter bag that is inserted into a stainless-steel perforated brew basket 44 (FIG. 6 ) of the brewer (Step 142 ). With the ground coffee in the nylon filter bag, hot water is added to the brewer (Step 144 ). The hot water may be in a range of 165° F. to 205° F. and more specifically in a range of 180° F. to 185° F. Once the hot water is added to the brewer (Step 144 ), the ground coffee is contacted with or exposed to the hot water (Step 146 ). The contacting or exposing of the ground coffee to the hot water is done in a manner to promote even saturation of the ground coffee with the hot water. The ground coffee may steep in the hot water for a range of 5 minutes to 25 minutes, e.g., 20 minutes. In some embodiments, the ground coffee is plunged into the hot water. Plunging may include plunging the coffee in the nylon filter bag into the hot water using a hand device. Additionally or alternatively, contacting or exposing the ground coffee with the hot water may include mixing or submerging the ground coffee in hot water to saturate the ground coffee in the hot water or circulating the hot water over the ground coffee. After the ground coffee is contacted by or exposed to the hot water (Step 146 ) and during the steeping, the ground coffee may be agitated in the hot water (Step 147 ) one or more subsequent times to aid in contact of the hot water with the ground coffee. The agitation of the ground coffee in the hot water (Step 147 ) occurs before removal of the entire brew basket from the hot water. The agitation of the ground coffee in the hot water in the brewer (Step 147 ) may occur at one or more predetermined times or intervals during the steeping of the ground coffee, e.g., 5, 10, or 15 minutes. Agitation may include re-plunging or stirring ground coffee within the hot water or shifting the position of a nylon bag or brew basket within the hot water. Additionally or alternatively, it may include circulating hot water over the ground coffee. The short brew time at a high temperature can be referred to as a “flash hot brew”. It will be appreciated that the short steeping or brewing time in hot water may be optimal to bring out the brightness/acidity and complexity of the ground coffee without drawing out bitter/astringent notes of the ground coffee. Further, the short brew time may prevent over-steeping and thus over-extraction from the ground coffee. Further, the short brew time may minimize oxidation of the brewed hot coffee extract by reducing exposure to air during the brewing process. After the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) is complete, e.g., reached the desired steeping time, the brew basket is removed (Step 148 ) from hot coffee liquid extract within the brewer to stop the brewing process and to separate the ground coffee from the hot coffee extract. Specifically, the brew basket including the coffee grounds in the nylon filter bag is lifted or hoisted from the out of the brewer. The brew basket may be allowed to drain over the brewer for a predetermined time to allow additional hot coffee extract to drain from the ground coffee grounds in the brew basket into the hot coffee extract within the brewer. The brew basket may be allowed to drain in a range of 5 minutes to 20 minutes, e.g., in a range of 10 minutes to 15 minutes. During the brewing process, from the contacting of the ground coffee with the hot water (Step 146 ) to the removal of the brew basket (Step 148 ) the temperature of the hot coffee extract in the brewer may drop below 180° F. while remaining above 145° F. After flash brewing (Step 140 ), the hot coffee extract in the brewer has a concentration less than 15° Brix, e.g., in a range of 3° Brix to 12° Brix. Other flash brewing processes are contemplated to produce a hot coffee extract having a desired concentration less than 15° Brix. For example, a “continuous” brewing processes can be used to produce a hot coffee extract having a desired concentration less than 15° Brix. Referring now to FIG. 5 , when the hot coffee extract in the brewer has a concentration within a desired range and/or the desired steep time of the flash brew process is complete (Step 140 ) and the hot coffee extract has been separated from the brewer (Step 148 ), the hot coffee extract is rapidly chilled (Step 160 ). To rapidly chill the hot coffee extract to below 130° F. (Step 160 ), frozen concentrated coffee extract 50 (FIG. 6 ) that has been previously roasted, processed, and frozen is thawed to a temperature suitable for pumping or flowing the frozen concentrated coffee extract into a mixing kettle (Step 152 ). The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be thawed to a temperature less than or equal to 41° F. In some embodiments, the frozen concentrated coffee extract is thawed to a temperature in a range of 18° F. to 38° F., e.g., 25° F. The thawed frozen concentrated coffee extract is then pumped or added to a mixing kettle (Step 154 ). The thawed frozen concentrated coffee extract may be added in the form of a slurry with some portions of the frozen concentrated coffee extract being in a solid, frozen phase and other portions being in a liquid phase. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be pumped or added to the mixing kettle 60 (FIG. 6 ) with minimal agitation to the frozen concentrated coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be pumped or added to the mixing kettle (Step 154 ) prior to, during, or after the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) of the hot coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may have a concentration in a range of 18° Brix to 45° Brix. The frozen concentrated coffee extract within the mixing kettle may include an antifoam agent. In some embodiments, the antifoam agent may be added to the frozen concentrated coffee extract after the frozen concentrated coffee extract is in the mixing kettle, may be added as the frozen concentrated coffee extract is being pumped into the mixing kettle, may be included in the frozen concentrated coffee extract, or may be included in hot coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract is concentrated without heating of a coffee extract used to form the frozen concentrated coffee extract. For example, the frozen concentrated coffee extract may be formed from freezing a brewed coffee to remove water from the brewed coffee to increase a concentration of the brewed coffee. With the hot coffee extract brewed and separated by removing the brew basket from the hot coffee extract (Step 148 ) and the frozen concentrated coffee extract in the mixing kettle (Step 154 ), the hot coffee extract is pumped from the brewer into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped from the brewer into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ), the hot coffee extract may be filtered (Step 158 ). The filtering of the hot coffee extract may remove particulates including, but not limited to, ground coffee from the hot coffee extract, e.g., coffee fines. The filtering of the hot coffee extract (Step 158 ) may include passing the hot coffee extract through a dual stage micron filter bank 48 (FIG. 6 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ), the hot coffee extract is mixed with and chilled by the frozen concentrated coffee extract within the mixing kettle to form a flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 160 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped into the mixing kettle, the frozen concentrated coffee extract rapidly chills the hot coffee extract to a temperature less than 130° F. while increasing the concentration of the hot coffee extract such that the flash brewed coffee concentrate within the mixing kettle has a concentration greater than 15° Brix. In some embodiments, the frozen concentrated coffee extract may rapidly chill the hot coffee extract to a temperature in a range of 75° F. to 110° F. and more particularly, in a range of 85° F. to 95° F. The rapid chilling of the hot coffee extract (Step 160 ) stops any further heat exposure and stops oxidation of the hot coffee extract as the hot coffee extract is mixed with the frozen concentrated coffee extract to produce the flash brewed coffee concentrate. Referring back to FIG. 1 , after the flash brewed coffee concentrate is mixed (Step 160 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be briefly heated to a temperature less than 190° F., e.g., in a range of 110° F. to 185° F., to a temperature of less than 175° F., e.g., in a range of 160° F. to 170° F., or to a temperature of less than 135° F., e.g., in a range of 110° F. to 130° F., for a predetermined time to ensure that the frozen concentrated coffee extract is fully melted and that any coffee solids within the flash brewed coffee concentrate are evenly distributed within the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ). During the brief heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be agitated. For example, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be agitated in the mixing kettle at a rate of 30% to 50%. The heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate and/or agitation of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may occur for 2 minutes to 5 minutes, e.g., 3 minutes. It will be appreciated that keeping the temperature to less than 190° F. may prevent the flavor development from being affected by the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ). A heat exchanger may be used to circulate flash brewed coffee concentrate to and from the mixing kettle until the desired temperature is reach or the mixing kettle 60 may include a water or steam jacket 62 (FIG. 6 ) that allows for controlled heating of the mixing kettle 60 . Before, during, or after the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), a sensory evaluation of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be conducted (Step 172 ). The sensory evaluation may include, but not be limited to, taste, smell, opacity, or color evaluation. After the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate is chilled to a temperature less than 45° F. (Step 180 ). The chilling of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 180 ) may be completed by pumping the flash brewed coffee concentrate from the mixing kettle and through a heat exchanger to chill the flash brewed coffee concentrate. The chilled flash brewed coffee concentrate may be filtered to remove any remaining undesirable materials from the chilled flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 182 ), e.g., coffee fines or foreign materials. While remaining at a temperature less than 45° F., the flash brewed coffee concentrate is a refrigerated finished product that may be stored or packed for shipping. For example, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be packed in 275 gallon totes 70 (FIG. 6 ), 55 gallon drums, or other suitable food-grade containers. The flash brewed coffee concentrate may have a shelf-life of at least three months when kept sealed at a temperature less than 45° F. The flash brewed coffee concentrate, described herein, may be intended to be shipped refrigerated in bulk form for further diluting with water, dairy, or non-dairy solution. In some embodiments, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be processed and packaged into smaller containers used in food service or retail applications including, but not limited to, pints, quarts, gallon PET or HDPE bottles, or 3 liter to 3 gallon bags-in-box (BIBs). The processing of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may include UHT processing or aseptic packaging. In some embodiments, the processing of the flash brewed coffee concentrate includes diluting the flash brewed coffee concentrate to a predetermined concentration, e.g., 1+7 dilution or 1+3 dilution. The flash brewed coffee concentrate may be prepared as a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage by mixing one-part flash brewed coffee concentrate with one or more parts liquid solution, such as water, milk, or non-dairy solution. This mixing may occur automatically in a dispenser or can be mixed and placed in a dispenser or pitcher at the establishment or in a home. It is contemplated that a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage may be a shelf-stable beverage or a refrigerated beverage that has been premixed at a processor with water, milk, or other non-dairy solution e.g., almond milk. In some embodiments, a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage may be premixed and packaged by a processor into single serve containers, pints, quarts, gallon PET or HDPE bottles, or 3 liter to 3 gallon bags-in-box (BIBs). While several embodiments of the disclosure have been shown in the drawings, it is not intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is intended that the disclosure be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Any combination of the above embodiments is also envisioned and is within the scope of the appended claims. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of particular embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope of the claims appended hereto.","11856964"

No. 12/247,232, filed Oct. 8, 2008, which is assigned to the same assignee as the subject patent application and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The disclosures herein relate generally to the preparation of beverages for consumption, and more particularly, to brewing beverages such as coffee. BACKGROUND Quality standards in the specialty coffee industry established during the 1950's and 1960's that coffee extraction of approximately 20% (usually a range of ˜18-22%) will achieve the best quality brewed coffee, using various brew methods. Over the ensuing years these established standards have been generally referred to as the gold-cup standard, and have been accepted internationally by many institutions, educational establishments, and standards committees. The precise extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration) may be varied for particular coffees, to achieve finely tuned recipes for particular coffee cultivars, climates and growing regions, also known as terroir, and other characteristics. Extraction (solubles yield) refers to the percentage of the dry coffee by weight that is removed by dissolving in water during the brewing process. Up to 30% of the available soluble solids in ground coffee can be extracted, with most of the remaining 70% being cellulose, and not soluble in water. However, generally speaking, extracting more than 22% will begin to sharply increase those components in coffee that contribute to the bitter taste defects associated with over-extraction. Extracting less than 18% is generally associated with weak, under-developed taste defects. The finished brew is a balance between extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration). Over-extracting results in the extraction of many of the bitter components of the remaining solids. These contribute significantly to those taste defects known as bitter, strong-bitter and weak bitter. Under-extracting causes a taste defect that is under-developed and can be weakly or strongly under-developed. As coffee dissolves, the bulk of the solids including the sweeter components dissolve during the first 30-50% of the brewing cycle, and the more bitter elements start to dissolve in the latter half of the brewing cycle. The highest quality coffee will have rich aroma, fullness of body, delicacy of flavor as well as clarity and unique character—all optimally balanced. Achieving these attributes requires a significant degree of precision during the coffee brewing process. Strength (solubles concentration) refers to the measured amount of solids extracted into the final coffee solution. Strength may be expressed as the percentage total dissolved solids (% TDS). For example, for 100 grams of a coffee measuring 1.3% TDS, there are 98.7 grams of water, and 1.3 grams of dissolved coffee solids in solution. Refractive index measurements have been used for process control in the food industry since the 1940s. Typical measurements are usually for sugars in fruits such as melons, for orange and other juices, for sugar content in grapes for the wine industry, and many other examples.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a prior original brewing chart that shows soluble solids vs. brew formula as a function of extraction percent, namely 5-40 percent as seen in the upper left of the chart (CBC Publication No. 27, 1969, p 12.). The y axis represents soluble solids concentration (strength) in percent while the x axis represents the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. Hyperbolic curves representing soluble solids yield extraction in percent from 5-40% are illustrated. Of particular interest in this series of hyperbolas are region of interest 105 and the smaller region of interest 110 . Region of interest 105 relates to a study carried out by the Brewing Committee of the National Coffee Association, which judged brews prepared within this region for objective acceptability. The Midwest Research Institute carried out a more recent independent study from which it was concluded that the most acceptable coffee would result from preparation within the more refined region of interest 110 , for soluble solids concentration (strength) from 1.15 to 1.35 percent and soluble solids yield extraction between 18 and 22 percent (Niven, W. W., Jr. and Shaw, B. C., Critical Conditions for Quality Coffee Brewing, Coffee and Tea Industries 80, No. 4, 44, April, 1957. Tea and Coffee Trade Journal, 112, No. 4, 28-Apr. 1957. Coffee Brewing Center, Nos. 19 and 27, 1969. The brewing chart of FIG. 1 signifies that a very small area of the curves thereof (i.e. region of interest 105 or region of interest 110 ) should be targeted for proper coffee extraction relative to the wide range of extraction possible. FIG. 2 is an enlargement of a portion of the brewing chart of FIG. 1 focusing on regions of interest 105 and 110 . FIG. 3 is a conventional representation of the data for FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 including solubles concentration (strength) vs. solubles yield (extraction) with brew formula as the parameter. More particularly, the y axis of FIG. 3 represents extracted solids in solution (percent TDS or total dissolved solids) while the x axis represents extraction in ounces per pound (solubles yield). The plotted curves are nearly straight lines (curves) that correspond to the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. The plot of FIG. 3 identifies a substantially centered rectangular region of interest 305 as representing the ideal coffee brew. This region of interest 305 is the same as originally published by the CBC and as identified as developed by the Midwest Research Institute, region 110 , previously in FIGS. 1 and 2. These plots assume the specific gravity of water at ambient temperature which may in fact be substantially different from the specific gravity of water at the actual brewing temperature. This assumption may have a negative impact on the brewing process and may affect the ability to reach a particular target percent of TDS of coffee in solution and a particular percent extraction if the ratio of coffee to water is determined at an incorrect temperature. Since the density of water changes as a function of temperature, the volume of water to weight of coffee ratios are affected accordingly. To further illustrate this problem, commercial brewer-extractors are typically preset to approximately 200 degrees F. and volume is calibrated at the boiler set point, whereas a home brewer typically uses water at tap or room temperature, i.e. an ambient temperature of approximately 50-65 degrees F. The volume of a given weight of water at room temperature will be significantly less than the volume of the same weight of water at 200 degrees F., because water is more dense at ambient than at 200 degrees. This scenario can lead to inaccurate brewing results when using the coffee brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIG. 4A is substantially the same coffee control brewing chart of FIG. 3 except that the x axis is now expressed in percent extraction, a more convenient unitless method of expression, instead of ounces extracted per pound of coffee. For example, if 3.2 ounces of coffee are extracted from 16 ounces of coffee, this corresponds to 20% extraction by weight. While the parameters of the x axis and y axis are expressed in percent, the brew formula of FIG. 4A remains in units of gallons of water per pound of coffee, as was the case in the brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIGS. 4B-4E show a similar conventional representation of the typical brewing chart in common use today. For each brew batch size and unit of measure, separate conventional representations are needed, where such representations show separate brew formulas each labelled for the weight of ground coffee called for in that dedicated batch size. FIGS. 4B-4E show separate charts required for each separate batch size, and units of measure used, including gallons of brew water per ounce of ground coffee, similarly half-gallons per ounce, liters per gram and quarts per ounce. Expressed alternatively, FIG. 4B is a conventional brewing chart for grams coffee per liter water. FIG. 4C is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 gallon water. FIG. 4D is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per half gallon water. FIG. 4E is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 quart water. FIG. 5 shows the universal coffee brewing chart that the disclosed coffee design software application may generate. Rectangle 505 denotes a region of interest of acceptable strength in percent total dissolved solids (% TDS or solubles concentration) and extraction percent (solubles yield) that are found to be very desirable for the experienced palate, typically from approx. 1.2% to approx. 1.4% strength and approx. 19% to approx. 21% extraction, more typically from approx. 1.15% to approx. 1.55% strength and approx. 18% to approx. 22% extraction. Such regions of interest may be defined specifically as being best suited for particular coffee cultivars, regions, roast styles, and terroir, and may be developed specifically as preferences or suggested recipes for brewing particular coffees, and may be further developed as a result of consumer taste profiles and overlaid as new regions of interest to suit a particular consumer preference, roaster preference or user preference. For example, consumer preferences may be plotted on an additional z-scale, and consider an n-point scale (from “like intensely” to “dislike intensely”) which is plotted as a three-dimensional surface chart, where the y-scale is solubles concentration (%) and the X-scale is solubles yield (%). The surface chart may then be resolved to a colorized two-dimensional chart by viewing the three-dimensional chart from the top, and plotting the z-axis (consumer preference) in colors and in two dimensions, along with the traditional solubles yield (percent extraction) and solubles concentration (percent TDS, strength) superimposed on the same two-dimensional chart. Such a representation may provide an update to the most recent “optimum balance” regions of interest, and as corrected for brew water temperature. Brew formula line 510 represents the brew formula of water and coffee and makes the brew formula a dimensionless unit of measure by stating brew formula as a ratio (e.g. 17.19) of water to coffee by weight. This ratio remains constant despite variations in size of coffee batches brewed or the units used, thereby eliminating a requisite of separate brewing control charts for each different unit of measure or changes in batch size, as required in the past with conventional brewing control charts. Unfortunately, the conventional brewing control charts of FIGS. 1-3, 4 A- 4 E are not flexible because a different brewing control chart is needed each time brewing batch size or units of measure changes. Moreover in these conventional charts, mixed units of volume of water are used with weight measurement units of coffee, mandating a new chart whenever a unit of measure or batch size changed. However, in one embodiment, the disclosed coffee design application and system is capable of generating a universal coffee brewing control chart that is stepless in portion sizes and continuous as coffee batch size, brew formulas, extraction and strength changes and as other variables change. The universal coffee brewing control chart also manages variable and mixed units, for example, brew water may be specified in gallons and coffee weight in grams, or water in liters and coffee weight in ounces. The disclosed coffee design application converts water volume at the temperature specified to weight to plot the correct brew formula ratio. Previous original brewing charts assumed water at room temperature, and conventional charts assumed water at 140 degrees F. as corrected for the hydrometer instrument used. However, the disclosed coffee design application corrects for the actual brew water temperature. The disclosed coffee design application will replot the control chart steplessly and in real time as the user changes design inputs. For example, as brew strength increases, brew formula line 505 may be continuously replotted to the left and higher in FIG. 5. Likewise, as brew strength decreases, brew formula line 505 may shift continuously to the right and lower in FIG. 5. With each change in the brew formula line, all other design output parameters are calculated and displayed continuously and in real time, and portions are determined based on actual start and brew water temperatures to maintain portions true to the brew formula ratio, eliminating previous errors in the range of 2-4%. With the universal coffee brew control chart that this application provides, there is no need for a series of different brew control charts for each batch size or units of measure. The following EQUATION 1 determines Percent Extraction using the Brew Formula Ratio, Water Density at Brew Temp and Percent TDS as variables. More particularly, from TDS %=0 to TDS %=10, the disclosed coffee design application determines Extraction for each TDS point using EQUATION 1: EXTRACTION %=(BF Ratio−water density_(g/ml@brew Temp)*waterLost_ml/g_coffee)/(1/TDS %−0.01))   EQUATION 1 To calculate Extraction % using this equation, Brew Formula Ratio (BF Ratio) should first be determined from the user input using the Strength Slider (TDS %) setting and the Target Extraction %. If the user changes the Strength Slider, then the BF Ratio changes and the brew formula line moves to a new location on the brew chart. Water density at brew temperature and water lost per gram are constants. Equation 1 is not a linear equation. The disclosed coffee design application plots the resulting point pairs on the control chart of FIG. 5 to draw the brew formula line 510 . The brew formula line 510 is drawn from generated data point pairs by incrementing Percent TDS from 0 to 10 and calculating Percent Extraction. The universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction, namely change in TDS over change in extraction. The Brew Formula is used to calculate these point pairs. As will be explained in more detail below, the disclosed coffee design application will plot the intended coffee design as a small circle 515 (red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . Subsequently, after brewing a sample batch of coffee according to the specified design parameters and measuring the total dissolved (TDS %) with the disclosed coffee refractometer, the disclosed coffee application will plot the actual measured coffee design as a large circle 520 (blue plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . FIG. 6A shows an information handling system 600 on which the coffee design application may execute as a computer program product. More particularly, FIG. 6 shows an information handling system (IHS) 600 that includes coffee design application 602 and an operating system 606 . IHS 600 may initially store coffee design application 602 as a computer program product on a non-transitory medium 608 , such as a CD, DVD or other non-transitory medium. In this particular embodiment, IHS 600 includes a processor 610 having multiple cores on a common semiconductor die 612 . IHS 600 processes, transfers, communicates, modifies, stores or otherwise handles information in digital form, analog form or other form. IHS 600 includes a bus 615 that couples processor 610 to system memory 620 via a memory controller 625 and memory bus 630 . A video graphics controller 635 couples display 640 to bus 615 . Nonvolatile storage 645 , such as a hard disk drive, CD drive, DVD drive, or other nonvolatile storage couples to bus 615 to provide IHS 600 with permanent storage of information. Operating system 606 loads in memory 620 to govern the operation of IHS 600 . I/O devices 650 , such as a keyboard and a mouse pointing device, couple to bus 615 via I/O controller 655 and I/O bus 660 . One or more expansion busses 665 , such as USB, IEEE 1394 bus, ATA, SATA, PCI, PCIE and other busses, couple to bus 615 to facilitate the connection of peripherals and devices to IHS 600 . A network interface adapter 670 couples to bus 615 to enable IHS 600 to connect by wire or wirelessly to a network and other information handling systems. While FIG. 6A shows one IHS that employs processor 610 , the IHS may take many forms. For example, IHS 600 may take the form of a desktop, server, portable, laptop, notebook, or other form factor computer or data processing system. IHS 600 may take other form factors such as a gaming device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld computing device, a portable telephone device, a communication device or other devices that include a processor and memory. A user of IHS 600 loads medium 608 into IHS 600 to store coffee design application 602 on non-volatile storage 645 as coffee design application 602 ′. When IHS 600 initializes, the IHS loads operating system 606 into system memory 620 for execution as operating system 606 ′. The IHS also loads coffee design application 602 ′ into system memory 620 for execution as coffee design application 602 ″. FIG. 6B shows a hand-held information handling system 675 that exhibits a small form factor such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). For example, IHS 675 may be a portable telephone type device or hand-held computer, such as an IHS that executes Microsoft Windows CE, or a Palm Pilot type device or an iPhone type IHS or smart phone. (PalmPilot is a trademark of Palm, Inc. iPhone is a trademark of Apple Inc.) In this embodiment, coffee design application 602 is embedded within the small form factor IHS as shown in FIG. 6B. In more detail, hand-held IHS 675 includes a microcontroller 676 that includes an internal memory 677 and firmware 678 . IHS 675 includes a non-volatile memory 679 coupled to microcontroller 676 . In one embodiment, non-volatile memory 679 stores coffee design application 602 therein as shown. In another embodiment, firmware 678 may contain coffee design application 602 or memory 677 may contain coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 includes a sensor package 680 that includes an accelerometer sensor 681 , a proximity sensor 682 , a touch sensor 683 and a photo sensor 684 . Sensor package 680 couples to microcontroller 676 . IHS 675 further includes an RF communication package 685 that includes a 3G/GPRS/GSM phone communication module 686 , and EDGE phone communication module 687 , an IEEE 802.11 network communication module 688 and a Bluetooth local communication module 689 . RF communication package 686 couples to microcontroller 676 . Both a touch sensitive display 690 and a camera 691 couple to microcontroller 676 as shown. A global positioning system (GPS) module 692 also couples to microcontroller 676 to provide position information thereto. In one embodiment, sensor package 680 generates a first position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a first spatial position or orientation such as a horizontal position, for example, with respect to a particular reference point. Sensor package 680 generates a second position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a second spatial position or orientation such as a vertical position with respect to the particular reference point. IHS 675 is configured to send the first and second position signals to coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 is further configured such that coffee design application receives user input from touch screen display 690 when sensor package 680 generates the first position signal indicating that the IHS 675 is in the first position. Coffee design application 602 responds to the first position signal and accepts user input when it receives the first position signal. For example, such user input may include user input preferences to set modes and temperatures, and user input commands to accept % TDS strength and other input variables using a combination of touch screen commands, buttons and text or number entry modes. When coffee design application 602 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second position, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response computes and plots the solution and charts results of the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula curve, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . In other words, the user holds IHS 676 horizontally while inputting information and flips the IHS 675 to a vertical position to command that IHS 675 draw a universal brewing control chart on the display 690 . It is noted that the first and second positions are described as being horizontal and vertical, respectively, for purposes of example. The disclosed IHS applies as well to other first and second positions or spatial orientations without departing from the spirit of the invention. FIG. 7 depicts a textual representation of the disclosed coffee design process  including 1) setting user preferences at set preferences block 705 , 2) conducting the design protocol at design protocol block 710 , 3) performing a total dissolved solids (TDS) measurement with a refractometer at TDS measurement block 715 , 4) correcting the brew protocol if necessary (included in block 715 ), 5) saving data at block 720 , and 6) printing data at block 725 . The process also includes providing help information at block 730 . The processor further includes an “about the program” block 730 with design credits, legal notices and license key information. FIGS. 7A-7B show provides a high level overview of the coffee design process. The screen shots of FIG. 8A-8J will provide more detail with respect to the coffee design process and are discussed below following discussion of the FIG. 7A-7B high level process. The user sets preferences in set preferences block 705 . More particularly, the user may select one of three different coffee design modes as a starting preference, namely: Start By Entering 1) brewing water volume 2) desired coffee yield or 3) ground coffee weight. In brewing water volume design mode, the user inputs starting brewing water volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS as input values. In response, coffee design application 602 determines or computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely ground coffee weight and resulting coffee yield volume. In desired coffee yield mode, the user inputs the desired coffee yield in volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight. In ground coffee weight mode, the user inputs the ground coffee weight and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume. In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may select the starting water temperature. In one embodiment, the default starting water temperature is 55 degrees F. However, a user may select a starting water temperature between 55 and 70 degrees F. if the user is using a home brewer with bottled or tap water. The user may also select a brewing temperature in block 705 . The default brewing temperature is 201 degrees F. in one embodiment. The user may select a brewing temperature that is typically between 190 and 205 degrees F. The user may also specify temperature units in degrees F. or degrees C. in block 705 . In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may also select target settings for the coffee brewing process. For example, the user may input a coffee target extraction (solubles yield). The default coffee target coffee extraction is 20%, but for some coffees, a user may want to target a lower value, such as 19.5%, to emphasize sweetness, or sugars content, typical of high elevation grown coffees, for example. For other coffees that lack certain types of acidic components, one may want to select a higher target extraction, such as 22%, for example, since higher solubles yield (extraction) of that particular coffee will not extract bitter components. The user may also specify an iced coffee target extraction for which the default is 19%, to emphasize sweetness. The user may also specify a finished iced coffee target TDS strength for which the default is 2% after dilution and brewing over ice. The user may also specify and input brew chart preferences such as enabling pan and zoom on the universal brewing chart (discussed below), turning on and off taste defect labels and turning on and off region labels, as well as specifying custom regions of interest by particular coffees and or consumer preference regions. In a special case, ICED Coffee final strength target is set by the user as a preference to provide the coffee design application an input for calculation of 97% ice melt (and dilution) of concentrate which starts at a concentration strength TDS of 3.8%, and ending up at 2.0% after dilution (ICE melt). In the design protocol block 710 of the process flow of FIGS. 7A-7B, the user may select or input desired starting value units. For example, for coffee yield the user may specify volume units such as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In another embodiment, coffee yield units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In an other embodiment, brew water units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may then enter input value in the units selected in the previous step, as well as the desired strength in percent TDS. For example, in the case of coffee yield in volume, the user may specify the desired coffee yield as 2 liters, or 1.5 gallons. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In each mode, the % TDS is also selected as in an input value. For coffee brewing protocols, brew water and coffee yield are typically measured in volume for practical reasons, due to the ease of measurement of such bulk in volume versus weight, as long as temperature (and density) are taken into account. However, in espresso, or single-serve coffee, where volumes are typically much smaller, for example, for a single-serve portion, measurements are more practical and also more accurate when specified in weight. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may also input a selection that the start temperature is the brew temperature if desired. More particularly, the user may select a “start temperature =brew temperature” checkbox (discussed below in FIG. 8) by checking such box if using a commercial brewer with a boiler tank or may leave the checkbox unchecked if using a home brewer with tap or bottled at 50-75 degrees F. The user may also select the desired strength preference within design protocol block 710 . The user may adjust and select the desired strength preference by moving an adjustable strength slider (discussed below in FIG. 8). The adjustable strength slider selects desired strength in total dissolved solids (TDS) percent. The TDS range accessible by the strength slider is based on beverage type. For hot coffee, the selectable range varies from 1.0-2.0% in one embodiment. The user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 2.00% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range'” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Alternatively, the user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 3.60% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range 2 ” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Extended ranges are useful for troubleshooting existing coffee brewing protocols in the field that are being evaluated to be corrected, and may not be within normal ranges, due to significant brew formula portioning errors in excess of 5-8%, for example, or excessive extraction errors, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 4%, to cover a range more appropriate for coffee concentrates, such as for iced coffee, or for hot coffee to be diluted to a desired strength preference by addition of hot water to the brewed concentrate, for a single serve beverage brewer, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 18%, to cover a range more appropriate for espresso, for example. Upon selection of the desired strength preference and the other input values and selection of units, coffee design application 602 generates a brew formula curve or line which is plotted on a universal coffee brewing chart such as shown in FIG. 5. Recall that the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction. The Brew Formula Ratio is used to calculate point pairs using Equation 1. The plotted brew formula line takes into account the volume of water as a function of temperature, and computes the correct weight of coffee required to meet the specified brewing protocol, and the resulting finished coffee yield. The target strength selected is plotted on the brew formula line as a small circle 515 (red point) and represents the targeted design parameters. The user then proceeds to brew the coffee using the design output parameters that coffee design application 602 generates. If the user selected brew water volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the resulting coffee yield volume and required ground coffee weight values corresponding to those input conditions. If the user selected desired coffee yield volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight values corresponding to that input condition. If the user selected coffee weight and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume corresponding to those input conditions. The user then employs the particular input conditions and corresponding values to actually brew a test batch of coffee. As part of the coffee design process of FIGS. 7A-7B, the user brews a sample of the targeted design batch of coffee as specified by the input conditions and corresponding determined variable values or results. The user places a sample of the test batch into the disclosed coffee refractometer (see FIG. 10 below) to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % by measuring the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Before using the refractometer, the user first calibrates the refractometer using distilled water. The refractometer and water should preferably be within the temperature range of 20 degrees-25 degrees C., in one embodiment. The user cools a 10-20 ml sample of the brewed coffee to between 20 degrees C. and 30 degrees C. The user places the cooled sample into the refractometer and allows 1-2 minutes for the sample and the refractometer to reach the same temperature. After temperature stabilization, the user takes a TDS % reading, as per bock 715 . The user then enters the TDS reading into coffee design application 602 . In response, coffee design application 602 adds a large circle plot point 520 (blue point) on the same brew formula line 510 of the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 generated during the design step. The large circle (blue point) % TDS measurement shows where the current coffee batch falls on that chart relative to the intended design point 515 (small red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield). After observing where the current coffee batch results appear on the universal coffee brewing chart, the user may take corrective action, if necessary, to ensure that the final coffee design for subsequent batches of coffee falls within the parameters of the desired region of interest. Such corrective action may include: 1) Under-Extraction: If the blue large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, below and to the left on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was under-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with under-developed flavors. Common causes of under-extraction are too coarse a grind, too short a contact time with water during the brew period, lack of pre-infusion or pre-infusion levels too low and/or time too short, water too hard (mineral content too high), brew temperature too low, and/or lack of even wetting or turbulence in the brew basket. 2) Over-Extraction: If the large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, above and to the right on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was over-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with over-extracted bitter flavors. Common causes of over-extraction are too fine a grind, too long a contact time with water during the brew period, pre-infusion levels too high and/or time too long, too much turbulence in the brew basket, water too soft (too low a mineral content), and/or brew temperature too high. FIGS. 8C, 8 E and 8 G depict screen shots of coffee design application 602 that show different startup modes that are selectable via user Startup Preferences (FIG. 8A), with input selections and corresponding outputs and universal brew formula plotted on charts 8 B, 8 D and 8 F. More particularly, the following design modes are selectable via user startup preferences: 1) brew water volume 2) desired coffee yield and 3) ground coffee weight. The user selects one of the 3 modes as starting input variables in coffee design application 602 . In response to this selection and percent TDS as inputs, coffee design application 602 determines the remaining 2 variables as outputs. For example, if the user selects brewing water volume (and selects a % TDS) as the starting variable or mode, coffee design application 602 determines a corresponding coffee yield and coffee ground weight. Alternatively, if the user selects desired coffee yield (and selects a % TDS), then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and coffee ground weight needed to achieve this desired coffee yield. This mode is a particularly useful and valuable tool for the coffee trade because it promotes better brewing practice. For example, typically, a brewer may be programmed to dispense water volume in units of gallons, for example one-half gallon. However, the user may be brewing into a commonly available 2.2 or 2.5 liter brewing thermos. Typical yield under these conditions will be approximately 1.7 liters, leaving 0.5 to 0.7 liters in the thermos empty. Coffee brewed in this manner will degrade more rapidly because it cools more quickly, and loses aromatic volatiles that evaporate and condense inside the empty portion of the thermos. Selecting this mode will automatically adjust the required brew water volume and ground coffee required to yield a full batch sized to the thermos is use. Using coffee design application 602 , any units of brew water volume, desired coffee yield and ground coffee weight may be selected to suit the actual conditions in the field. Alternatively, if the user selects coffee ground weight (at the desired % TDS strength) as a starting variable or mode, then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and resulting coffee yield. This mode is particularly useful for users of pre-ground coffee packets (pillow-packs), where the user selects a fixed coffee portion and desired percent TDS (strength) and application 602 outputs the required brew water volume and resulting yield to brew to gold-cup standards. Coffee design application 602 generates three windows that help to design and measure brewing parameters. These windows are 1) a startup preferences or brewing preferences window, 2) a main application window and a 3) universal brewing control chart. Coffee design application 602 charts parameters and provides instant feedback so that adjustments, when necessary, can be made quickly and effectively by the user. FIG. 8A shows a Startup Preferences window 801 that coffee design application 602 generates to enable the user to input operating modes and preferences. Preferences (including changes) are saved automatically between application sessions. The user starts a first design session using the Default Preferences. Upon entering startup preferences window 801 , the user selects a preferred design mode in the “Start by Entering” area 802 in the upper left corner of window 801 . The user selects one of the three buttons in the “Start by Entering” area 802 , namely 1) the Water Volume button 803 —Select this option to design by entering the Brew Water Volume amount. In this mode, the software determines or calculates the ground coffee and coffee yield amounts based on user strength TDS selected, 2)the Desired Coffee Yield (Vol) button 804 —Select this option to design by entering the Desired Coffee Yield Volume; in this mode, the coffee design application software 202 determines or calculates the ground coffee and brew water amounts based on user strength TDS selected, or 3) the Ground Coffee Weight button 805 —Select this option if you are working with a fixed weight of coffee, such as a pillow pack. In this mode, the coffee design application software 202 calculates the brew water volume and coffee yield volume amounts based on user strength TDS selected. The user may select the “Start Value=Last Used” checkbox 806 if the user desires the coffee design application 602 to remember the mode and values used in the last session upon the next startup of the application. Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Target Settings” area 807 where the user may input Hot Coffee Target Extraction % at box 808 . For standard drip brewing of coffee, this default is set to 20 percent extraction, an industry standard “starting point” applicable to a wide range of coffees. For a sweeter cup, the user may try 18.5-19.5 percent, depending on taste preferences, the particular coffee, degree of roast, and grade of grind. Note that extracting to lower targeted levels will require more coffee to achieve the same strength preference. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Extraction at box 809 . For iced coffee, the default target extraction of 19% results in a sweeter cup that is significantly less bitter than a setting of 20% would provide. With higher elevation grown coffees rich in sugars, this recipe often results in a sweet tasting batch without the use of supplemental sweeteners. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Strength at box 810 . For iced coffee, this is the final result of the concentrate after 95-97% all of the ice has melted at the end of the brew. The concentrate is ready to use immediately after the brew cycle has completed. Box 811 indicates the current strength (% TDS) range selected for the available design and chart range. If the user selects normal range checkbox 811 A, then box 811 displays a strength range of 1.15-1.55%. If the user selects “Extended Range 1 ” checkbox 811 B, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-2.00%. If the user selects “Extended Range 2 ” checkbox 811 C, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-3.6%. These ranges extend the user selectable TDS strength range and also resize the Y-axis on the universal brewing control chart accordingly, and is useful for troubleshooting existing brewing protocols in the field that are out-of-range and off the universal brew chart region of interest Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Water Temperatures” area 812 where the user may input the starting temperature of the water in the brewer at “Start” box 813 and the actual brew temperature of the water in the brewer at “Brew” box 814 . The user may select either a degrees F. or a degrees C. scale at temperature scale selection box 812 A. For example, the user should select the Brew Temp at Brew box 814 to the programmed setting of the user's brewer (usually 195-202 Deg F.) for light to medium roasted coffees, slightly lower, i.e., 195 Deg F. for dark roasted coffees. The user may enter the start temperature at Start Temperature box 813 to what may typically be in use at home, which should be equal to either TAP water temperature or room temperature (i.e., for bottled water). Using the start and brew temperatures specified, application 602 determines the actual brew water volume and ground coffee weight required to maintain the correct brew formula ratio, a common cause of error when trying to transfer brew formulas from a commercial to a home brewer for example. Preferences window 801 further includes a “Chart Settings” area 815 for setting preferences in the universal brewing control chart that coffee design application 602 generates. In one embodiment coffee design application 602 may allow the displaying of stored or custom regions of interest for optimum balance to be overlaid onto the universal brewing control chart. Coffee taste preference “regions” have been previously defined by different organizations (i.e. Midwest Research Institute (MRI), Coffee Brewing Center (CBC), Norwegian Coffee Center (NCC) as the “Optimum Balance” regions, or, as shown, other custom regions may be added to the chart based on individual preferences found to be appropriate for particular coffees, roast styles, and or customer surveys. Such custom regions need not be rectangular, as shown, but may be any shape including three dimensional, exhibiting preferences in percentile categories. Selecting the “Show Region Labels” checkbox 816 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a label identifying the region of interest. Selecting the “Show Taste Labels” checkbox 817 instructs the coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart that displays taste defect labels (i.e., bitter or under-developed). Selecting the “Enable Zoom/Pan” checkbox 818 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart on which the user may use mouse and/or trackpad controls to zoom/pan the Universal Brewing Control Chart along with its axis. The final universal brewing control chart as configured, plotted and labeled may be saved in any commonly available formats (such as jpeg, png, bmp, emf, gif, tif), emailed, entered into a database, electronically shared, and or printed on demand. Upon completion of entering input preferences and settings in startup preferences window 801 , the user may select Done box 819 . After the Startup Preferences have been selected as described above, the user completes the brewing protocol design process in the coffee design application 602 in the Main Application Window shown in FIG. 8C. More details on using the Main Application Window discussed below with reference to FIG. 8C. However, before discussion Main Application Window in detail, it is helpful to first discuss the Universal Brewing Control Chart of FIG. 8B that coffee design application 602 produces. Coffee design application 602 performs all calculations and plots a brewing control chart dynamically and in real time as you change the % TDS strength preference slider control. Coffee design application 602 converts between different types of units instantly and accurately, and allows for mixed units (i.e., brew water in gallons, coffee yield in liters). Coffee design application 602 draws a custom brew formula line on a universal brewing control chart using any combination of selected units in weight and or volume, without restrictions to fixed portions. Application 602 also provides a relative indication of designed recipe to the measured results, in reference to a number of internationally recognized “optimum” brewing ranges. Application 602 further provides a means to troubleshoot current brewing protocols, measure and plot results which immediately identify portioning and extraction errors, and provides a means to correct them. The appearance of the Main Design Window of FIG. 8C depends on the variable the user selected to enter as the INPUT data in the Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A. Coffee design application 602 displays the computed OUTPUT data immediately below in the next group box of the window, and plots the results on the Universal Brewing Control Chart dynamically and in real time in a charting window seen in FIG. 8B. The completed data and universal brewing control chart as configured, labeled and plotted on the Main Application Window may be saved, recalled, electronically shared, printed or emailed. Each “recipe” may be stored separately, or in one embodiment of the application 602 , as part of a database residing within the application or as part of a shared networked database application. FIG. 8B shows a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 that includes a representative coffee brew formula line 821 . The Universal Brewing Control Chart plots the actual design point 822 (small circle) and measured results 823 (large circle) from input data and % TDS measurements from the disclosed coffee refractometer. FIG. 8B shows a typical universal coffee brewing control chart 820 , taken from the brew formula discussed below. FIG. 8B shows the desired brew formula line as brew formula line 821 . The brew formula line 821 represents the ratio (17.08:1) of water to coffee by weight used to brew the coffee. The resulting TDS of the brewed coffee will be determined by the brew formula, as well as other factors (temperature, grade of grind, dwell time, and turbulence). The final % TDS measurement 823 may then be followed down to the X-axis, to see how close the results (19.8%) came to the design target extraction (20.0%). The small circle 822 on the Brew Formula line shows the selected strength design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 on the brew formula line 821 shows the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring and inputting the TDS % of the brewed coffee into coffee application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. The actual resulting extraction and strength are plotted as a result of the TDS % measurement on a specialized coffee refractometer disclosed and discussed below in more detail. Universal brewing control chart 820 includes a number of coffee design target regions of interest. Chart 820 shows the George Howell Coffee Company (GHCC) suggested target region of interest as region of interest 824 for optimum balance. Chart 820 also shows a Midwest Research Institute region of interest 825 . Chart 820 further shows a target region of interest 826 defined by the Norwegian Coffee Center. FIG. 8C shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew from the starting water volume is now discussed, namely the water volume mode. The Startup Preferences discussed earlier set up the main window for this water volume mode, including brew water temperature to match the brewer boiler setting in use. The brew water volume is first calibrated, according to the brewer manufacturer specifications, to dose correctly the amount of water programmed as the starting brew water volume. The user then performs the following coffee design steps: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left-hand corner of main application window 827 . 2. Enter the preferred Brew Water units in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Water Volume field 830 , and enter the Water Volume in the Water Volume field 830 . For example, the user may enter a brew water volume value of 0.50 gal. in Water Volume field 830 . 3. Select the preferred Strength TDS % with the slider 831 on the window's left side. In response to the above described user design inputs, application software 602 determines the brew formula and the corresponding required Ground Coffee weight and final Coffee Yield. Coffee design application 602 then displays the determined Ground Coffee weight at Ground Coffee weight box 833 and displays the final Coffee Yield at Coffee Yield box 832 . Final values, including the brew formula ratio, are also displayed in the legend of the brewing control chart. The units are selectable by the user at units select boxes 834 and 835 . In this example, the resultant yield is 56.52 fl oz (US) and the ground coffee weight is 3.75 oz (wt.) The coffee design application 602 draws the brew formula curve 821 as seen in the universal coffee brewing control chart of FIG. 8D. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target Strength TDS 822 at the pre-set target extraction of 20%. 4. If not done earlier, the user may enter the preferred units of measure in the two output fields, namely Coffee Yield volume 834 and Ground Coffee weight 835 of FIG. 8C. Alternatively, the user may convert these units to any desired units using boxes 834 and 835 . 5. After brewing in accordance with the above parameters, the user may test the total dissolved solids (TDS) using the disclosed coffee refractometer. The user may enter the measured % TDS in the Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 after selecting TDS % at box 837 as the instrument readout mode. Alternatively, coffee design application 602 will provide a conversion estimate for TDS % using box 837 that may be set to ppm or BRIX if another TDS instrument or refractometer provides readings in those units. 6. The user may use a File>Save menu selection to save the brew formula, chart and portion plan, and may print the same if desired. To summarize, in the above example, beverage type was set to Hot Coffee, brew water volume was set to 0.50 gallons, and the strength slider 831 was set to 1.3% as the desired coffee strength. Coffee design application 602 determines the brew formula ratio, the required ground coffee in oz-wt and the resulting brewed coffee yield in fl-oz volume. Brew temperature was the same as start temperature at 201 Deg F. FIG. 8E shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the second mode, namely, coffee yield as input, is now discussed as coffee yield mode. Traditionally, brew formulas have been developed using a pre-set volume of brew water as part of the brew recipe. For example, a one (1) gallon batch meant setting the brewer for one gallon of brew water, and using approximately 7.5 ounces coffee (i.e., the gold-cup standard for 1.3% TDS). However, this method results in a final yield of approximately 112-fluid ounces, leaving about 16-fl oz empty in the brewing vessel. In the Desired Yield mode, the disclosed coffee design application 602 enables the user to specify one (1) gallon of finished coffee to fill the brewing vessel completely. In one embodiment, coffee design application 602 determines exact portions of brew water and ground coffee required, for example 1.13 gallons of brew water and 8.5 ounces of coffee. This design mode allows the user to specify the finished yield needed to fill a brewing thermos, rather than leave a significant percentage empty. Units can be mixed in any combination (brew water in gallons, yield in liters), and coffee design application 602 determines the required results in the units specified. For example, for a 2.5 liter thermos, 0.75 gallons brew water and 5.6 ounces of coffee will yield exactly 2.5 liters of finished coffee. To ensure accurate portions of water and coffee, coffee design application 602 takes into account the water lost in the spent basket and the volume of water required as a function of temperature. The brew basket refers to a vessel (not shown) that holds coffee grounds in the correct depth and area in the brewer for proper wetting and extraction during the coffee brewing process. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Desired Coffee Yield button 804 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8E and enters the desired coffee yield into Desired Coffee Yield box 830 as shown in FIG. 8E. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Set the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 [in the lower left corner of main application window 827 ] to select the Hot Coffee charting range. 2. Select the preferred units of measure of the Desired Yield in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Desired Yield field box 830 , and enter the Desired Yield for the finished coffee in Desired Yield field box 830 . For example, the user may select liters in box 829 and 2.35 in box 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields at Brew Water Volume unit selection box 834 and Ground Coffee Weight unit selection box 835 . In this particular example, coffee design application 602 determines the required Brew Water Volume in liters and the Ground Coffee weight required in grams. When using a commercial brewer, the user should check Start=Brew Temperature box 838 to indicate that the starting temperature is equal to the brewing temperature. 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.27 TDS % in this example. 5. After brewing a batch of coffee under the input conditions above, the user may measure the total dissolved solids in the batch of coffee from a sample thereof. The user places a sample of the brewed batch in the disclosed coffee refractometer discussed in more detail below. The coffee refractometer measures Total Dissolved Solids in percent (%). The user takes a TDS reading from the coffee refractometer and enters the measured % TDS in the “Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement” field or box 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode facilitates better coffee brewing practice in a number of ways. For example, in this design mode, application 602 determines or calculates the coffee and water portions required to nearly fill the brewing vessel completely. This mode also reduces the amount of air in a thermos or other coffee brew receptacle, and reduces the loss of aroma producing volatiles, while increasing the volume of hot coffee brewed. The additional thermal mass of coffee keeps the thermos hot longer, and can increase hold times by up to 10-15 minutes per batch. This mode may also reduce the frequency of brewing, making a coffee brewing operation more efficient. This mode may allow brewing larger batches that inherently reduces portioning errors. In the “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode in the example of FIG. 8E, the Beverage Type is set to Hot Coffee at Beverage Type drop down menu 828 , and Desired Yield is set to 2.35 Liters in boxes 830 , 832 for a 2.5 Liter Thermos receptacle. Strength slider 831 is set to 1.27% TDS. The disclosed coffee refractometer is used to test a sample of the brewed coffee. In this example, the coffee refractometer measures a TDS value of 1.3%, which is entered by the user at Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement input box 836 . In response to entering the TDS value, coffee design application 602 plots a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ as shown in FIG. 8F. Universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ shows the brew formula, namely a brew formula line 821 ′, as a brew formula ratio of 17.56 to 1. Coffee design application 602 plots a small circle 822 ′ that indicates the selected strength coffee design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 ′ on brew formula line 821 ′ indicates the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring the TDS % of the brewed coffee sample with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputting the measured TDS % into coffee design application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. Since the measured coffee results are within 0.5% of the target extraction (solubles yield) of the design target, no further adjustment is required in this example. The final coffee design recipe values are also shown in the chart Legend 840 , at the bottom of the chart 820 ′. FIG. 8G shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the third mode, namely ground coffee weight as input, is now discussed as ground coffee weight mode. Design by ground coffee weight is a commonly used in high volume feeder establishments using pre-measured, pre-ground pillow packs. While it is not preferable to pre-grind coffee for freshness reasons, this mode is provided to address such feeder establishments, so they can improve their coffee brewing practices to internationally accepted standards. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Ground Coffee Weight button 805 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8G and enters the ground coffee weight into ground coffee weight box 830 as shown in FIG. 8G. For example, if the weight of a pre-ground coffee pillow pack is 3.5 oz, then the user selects the unit ounces in unit selection box 829 and inputs 3.5 into box 830 as shown. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left corner of main application window 827 . 2. Select the preferred unit of measure in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Ground Coffee field 830 , and enter the weight in the Ground Coffee field 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields, namely Brew Water Volume and Yield. Coffee design application 602 determines or calculates the required Brew Water Volume and the final coffee Yield volume in the units selected. Start Temperature=Brew Temperature is checked at checkbox 838 . 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . In this example, the user engages slider 831 to select a strength of 1.3%. 5. After brewing coffee in accordance with the determined parameters, the user then employs the disclosed coffee refractometer to measure the total dissolved solids, TDS, of a sample of the brewed coffee. The user enters the measured % TDS in the Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This example illustrates how to design to desired strength protocols using fixed ground coffee packets by weight. Coffee design application 602 calculates the required brew Water Volume and Yield volume of coffee in the units selected. The Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 was set to Hot Coffee. Ground Coffee was set to the packet size of 3.5 ounces weight. Strength slider was set to 1.30% TDS. Dissolved Solids were measured and entered at 1.3% Coffee design application 602 draws a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ″ as shown in FIG. 8H. In FIG. 8H, box 824 ″ represents the desired target region and line 821 ″ represents the particular brew formula ratio, namely 17.19 to 1, in this particular example that employs 0.47 gallons of water and 3.5 oz (wt) of coffee to brew a batch of coffee. Small circle 822 ″ represents the desired design point on brew formula line 821 ″, while large circle 823 ″ represents the actual coffee design point determined in response to the measured TDS % of the brewed coffee batch measure in the disclosed coffee refractometer. Region 824 ″ is the particular region of interest on the brew control chart of FIG. 8H. This design mode is useful for users of pre-ground and pre-weighed fixed packs of ground coffee wishing to improve their coffee brewing protocols by providing a means to reprogram their brewers to brew to gold-cup standards, even though fixed weight packs have been provided. FIG. 8I shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 which is also useful in designing coffee concentrates. This example shows an iced coffee design, where the user selects iced coffee in Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 . The coffee design application 602 will design coffee extraction protocols for Iced Coffee Concentrate, to be brewed fresh and directly over ice. Coffee design application 602 calculates coffee concentrate TDS strength both before and after ice is melted. The process is designed to allow approximately 95% to approximately 97% percent of the ice to melt at brew completion time, so that the finished concentrate is cold, and ready to serve immediately after brewing. In one embodiment, the complete brewing cycle takes only 5-6 minutes, typically. Care should be taken using this mode to choose portions that will not overload nor overflow the brew basket. For example, a 0.5-1.0 gallon brewer may be able to brew 7-9 ounces of ground coffee, but could overflow the brew basket if more ground coffee is used. Generally, a 1.5 gallon brewer can accommodate up to 12-14 ounces ground coffee. Design by coffee weight mode is supported in this embodiment, to ensure such limitations are adhered to, and application 602 determines the required brew water volume, concentrate yield, and weight of ice required. In this example, the user sets the coffee brew strength to 3.8% using slider 831 . The user employs brew water volume as the starting value in Enter Starting Value box 830 . The units are gallons in unit selection box 829 . In this example, it is assumed that a typical 1.5 gallon brewer is being used. The brewer is programmed to dispense 0.7 gallons, yielding approximately a half-gallon (0.49 gal) of coffee at 3.7% TDS. The coffee is brewed into an open top container containing 62 ounces-weight of ice, then stirred and covered. The resulting concentrate is after serving over ice in a glass filled two-thirds will be about 1.5-1.8% TDS. Total concentrate yield is just under one gallon. This serves approximately sixteen 16-oz servings (7.5 fl oz concentrate over approximately 8 oz-wt ice). Coffee design application 602 plots the resultant brew formula ratio curve 821 ′″ as seen in FIG. 8J. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target coffee design point as small circle 822 ′″. After the user measures the total dissolved solids TDS % with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputs the TDS % value, for example 3.7%, in box 836 , application 602 plots the actual coffee design point at large circle 823 ′″ on brew formula ratio line 821 ′″. FIG. 9A is a flowchart that shows process flow in the methodology that the disclosed information handling system 600 employs.

System 600 receives the user's Beverage Type selection as input to the coffee design process. System 600 presents a slider tool 831 to the user to enable the user to select a design coffee strength, as per block 910 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.3% with the slider tool, or may also use arrow keys, touch screen controls or other methods for setting the input value. System 600 receives the user's selection of coffee strength as input to the coffee design process. System 600 determines the brew formula ratio using 1) weight of water, determined from the volume of the water at the prescribed brewing temperature 2) the target extraction percent (% solubles yield) and 3) the design TDS target strength (% solubles concentration) from the slider control (i.e. coffee strength), as per block 912 . The final brew formula ratio is equal to the weight of water divided by the weight of coffee as determined by the above parameters, and remains the same regardless of the brew batch size. System 600 generates a universal control chart graph including a grid showing TDS range (%) on the y axis vs. coffee extraction (%) on the x axis, as per block 914 . Using the brew formula ratio determined in block 912 , system 600 plots and displays on the universal control chart graph the brew formula line that represents the brew formula ratio. System 600 performs tests to determine if the user selected 1) brew water volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, or 3) ground coffee weight mode at decision blocks 918 , 920 and 922 . If the user selected 1) brew water volume mode, then process flow continues to the brew water volume module of FIG. 9B, as per block 924 . If the user selected 2) desired coffee yield mode, then process flow continues to the desired coffee yield mode of FIG. 9C, as per block 926 .

The user or other entity then brews coffee using the specified parameters and determined variables or results, as per block 990 .

For example, the disclosed coffee refractometer may determine the TDS % that a sample of the brewed coffee exhibits. System 600 displays the actual TDS reading on the universal brewing control chart graph, as per block 992 . For example, large circle 823 ″ of the universal brewing control chart graph of FIG. 8H shows such a display of actual TDS results. Process flow continues back to the select design mode block 900 of FIG. 9A, as per block 993 . The user may then again select any coffee design mode desired. Returning again to the small form factor or hand-held information handling system (IHS) 675 of FIG. 6B, it is noted that IHS 675 receives user input in one spatial orientation or position and outputs results to its display 690 when the user moves or changes the IHS to a second spatial orientation or position. More specifically, the user may use touch screen display 690 to make user selections and provide other input while IHS 675 is in the first position. For example, the user employs touch screen display 690 to select startup preferences such as selecting one of multiple design modes, namely 1) brewing water volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, and 3) ground coffee weight mode. The user may also make other input selections shown in startup preferences of FIG. 8A while IHS 675 is oriented in the first spatial orientation. In response to such input and when the user changes the spatial orientation of the IHS to a second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 draws a universal brewing control chart such as shown in FIGS. 8B, 8 D, 8 F, 8 H and 8 J on display 690 . The displayed universal control chart displays the results of user input which may include a TDS % reading from the disclosed refractometer for a brewed coffee sample that is brewed in accordance with the coffee design parameters that coffee design application 602 determines. In one embodiment, to complete the final plot point on the universal brewing control chart, the actual measured % TDS may be entered when IHS 675 is in either the first or second spatial position. For example, the measured % TDS from the disclosed coffee refractometer may be entered on touch screen display 690 on either the universal brewing control chart on the display while the IHS exhibits the second orientation (such as vertical) or the Main Application window while the IHS exhibits the first orientation (such as horizontal) by using extended touch screen commands that appear on the universal brewing control chart, for example, as buttons or data entry boxes, in a visible layer behind the partially transparent displayed chart. Generally, IHS 675 receives the user's input selections while IHS 675 exhibits the first spatial orientation while coffee design application 602 receives the first position signal from sensor package 680 . When coffee design application 602 of IHS 675 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response determines or calculates the solution to the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . Specific recipes for any number of brew formula sessions may be stored in the IHS 675 as an integrated database in non-volatile memory 679 , and or transmitted to a database via any of a number of wireless protocols, including web-based sharing protocols, or electronically mailed to other users to share, and interactively modify, for example, based on a collaborative approach to establishing a desired brewing protocol. Such recipes may be used to control brewing protocols for an entire installed base of brewing equipment, such equipment being programmable manually or automatically to execute said protocol(s), through a manual, wired or wireless interface, for example, for feeder establishments wishing to maintain a high quality coffee brewing program to ensure consistency from cup-to-cup across its entire installed base of restaurants, cafes or coffee bars. FIG. 10A shows the disclosed refractometer 1000 that is usable to measure TDS % of a brewed coffee sample by determining the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Refractometer 1000 includes a light source 1005 such as a yellow semiconductor laser that generates 589 nm light in one embodiment. An illumination lens 1010 directs the light from light source 1005 toward prism 1015 as shown. Prism 1015 receives incident light 1017 from light source 1005 as shown. Prism 1015 is a transparent material that exhibits an index of refraction “n p ”. The user or other entity or apparatus places a coffee brew sample 1020 on prism surface 1025 in preparation for measurement of the index of refraction “n s ” that the brew sample 1020 exhibits. A collection lens 1030 collects light 1032 refracted or reflected by the prism sample interface 1034 and directs that light to a linear photo detector 1035 . The purpose of the illumination lens 1010 is to direct light from light source 1005 to prism 1015 . More specifically, the purpose of illumination lens 1010 is to form a focusing beam or cone of light incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 that ranges in angles of incidence between a minimum angle of incidence, θ min , and a maximum angle of incidence, θ max . The angle of incidence is measured relative to the normal surface 1027 which is perpendicular to the prism surface 1025 . In one embodiment, the critical angle q c of the prism-sample interface 1034 should be such that θ min <θ c <θ max . A unique property of the critical angle is that for all angles larger than than θ c , 100% of the light is reflected from the interface 1034 and none transmits. For angles inside of the prism 1015 that are less than θ c , some light transmits into the sample material 1020 and therefore less than 100% of the light is reflected. In other words, for all rays in the beam of light generated by illumination lens 1010 that are focused in the prism to an incident angle greater than the critical angle θ c , 100% of the light is reflected off of the prism-material interface 1034 and propagates towards the collection lens 1030 and then on to the linear detector 1035 or photodetector. The light ray that is incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 at θ c will strike the linear detector 1035 at a point x=x c . By analyzing the detected light levels from x=0 to x=x max on the detector 1035 , the firmware 1047 or software of the refractometer detects the position x c since for x c <x<x max , the light level is substantially constant across the detector array 1035 . With a well-calibrated refractometer, the detector position x c is mapped back to a critical angle θ c , which from EQUATION 8 below and knowing the index of refraction of the prism n p , the index of refraction n s of the sample can be determined and displayed or otherwise reported. θ c =arcsin( n s /n p )   EQUATION 8 Therefore, in refractometer 1000 the index of refraction of the prism 1015 must satisfy n p >n s for all values of n s desired to be measured in order for a critical angle θ c to exist. Given the range of θ c resulting from the range of n s to be measured, the illumination lens 1010 arrangement is designed to include this range of angles relative to the surface normal 1027 of surface 1025 . Similarly, the collection lens 1030 is designed such that the range of angles θ c are linearly mapped to positions x on the linear detector array 1035 . By way of example, for a refractometer designed to operate with a sugar solution between 0 and 10° BRIX at 20° C., one requires the ability to detect indices of refraction ranging from 1.3330 to 1.3479. Using a source with a wavelength of λ 0 =589 nm and a prism made of BK7 (n p =1.5167@λ 0 ), the range of critical angles to detect are θ c =61.50° to 62.71°. Choosing an Eastman Kodak (Rochester, N.Y.) linear CCD array model KLI-2113 with an array of 2098 pixels for linear detector 1035 , the theoretical resolution is 7E-6 in index of refraction and 0.005° BRIX. In addition to being wavelength sensitive, the index of refraction for any material changes slightly with temperature. For water at 20° C. (68° F.) the index of refraction is 1.333 and changes by −0.0001 for every degree C. The disclosed coffee refractometer includes automatic temperature compensation as described in more detail below. Refractometer 1000 includes a microcontroller 1045 with control firmware 1047 or control software therein. Microcontroller 1045 includes a memory store 1049 for storage of information and data. Refractometer 1000 also includes a temperature sensor 1050 near the prism-sample interface 1034 of prism 1015 . Temperature sensor 1050 couples to an input of microcontroller 1045 to inform microcontroller 1045 of the current temperature of the prism-sample interface 1034 . A control line 1055 couples microcontroller 1045 to light source 1005 to enable microcontroller 1045 to control light source 1005 . Refractometer 1000 also includes a display 1060 to allow refractometer 1000 to display measurement results such as a TDS % value of the brew sample 1020 . Refractometer 1000 further includes a network interface 1065 that enables refractometer 1000 to connect via wire or wirelessly to other information handling systems 600 or the Internet 1070 . Information handling system 600 may include coffee design application 602 which uses the TDS % coffee brew sample result from the refractometer 1000 as input for coffee design universal control chart display purposes. FIG. 10B is a block diagram of a brewing station 1075 that employs the disclosed coffee design system 600 and the disclosed coffee refractometer 1000 . In one embodiment, coffee brewing station 1075 includes a hot water supply 1076 and a brew basket assembly 1077 where coffee grounds mix with hot water to form a coffee drink. As the coffee drink exits brew basket 1077 , the coffee drink flows downward into a vessel 1078 that captures the brewed coffee. Vessel 1078 dispenses brewed coffee to coffee pot 1079 or other container suitable for transporting of the brewed coffee to the coffee drinker. In one embodiment, a coffee refractometer 1000 is situated in vessel 1077 so that refractometer 1000 may determine the TDS reading of a freshly brewed batch of coffee immediately after brewing. A user may take a reading of the TDS % of the coffee from the display of refractometer 1000 . The user may then manually input the TDS % reading into coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 . In response, coffee design application 602 displays the actual TDS % and extraction on the plotted brew line of a universal brew line chart such as seen in FIG. 5. In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 10B, refractometer 1000 couples to, or otherwise communicates with IHS 600 . In this manner, refractometer 1000 reads and supplies TDS % data to coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 without manual user intervention. FIG. 11A is a flowchart that depicts process steps for configuring refractometer 1000 to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % of a brew coffee sample. To use refractometer 1000 to measure the total dissolved solids (TDS) of coffee or any other liquid, refractometer 1000 should be both calibrated and correlated. The calibration of a refractometer is performed by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. The correlation of a refractometer is the conversion of the measured index of refraction to a scale of interest to the end user. Typically, refractometers have software that correlates to a BRIX scale. In that case the software assumes that the index of refraction of the liquid presented to the refractometer corresponds to a sugar-water solution and will output a BRIX value (equal to the % sugar by weight in solution) based upon the measured refractive index. Unfortunately, for most other liquids, such as coffee, a BRIX scale is not valid and can lead to erroneous results. To configure refractometer 1000 to measure the TDS of a brewed coffee sample, process flow commences at start block 1105 in the flowchart of FIG. 11A. A user or other entity first calibrates refractometer 1000 , as per block 1110 . The calibration of refractometer 1000 is performed in the conventional manner by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. To correlate refractometer 1000 for coffee, the change in index of refraction with TDS as well as temperature is determined. The user or other entity begins correlation of refractometer 1000 , as per block 1115 . One exemplary and preferred method of determining the TDS of a coffee solution is through a dehydration method. To start the correlation procedure, different batches of coffee are brewed at different brew concentrations, while maintaining approximately the same extraction percentage from the selected batch of roasted and ground coffee beans, as per block 1120 . In other words, the user or other entity brews multiple coffee samples with different respective coffee concentrations in terms of total dissolved solids (TDS) %. The extraction percentage set during the refractometer correlation procedure is preferably the extraction percentage chosen as that of an ideal coffee solution for consumption. For purposes of example, the extraction percentage is 20%±1% although it is possible to employ other extraction percentages if desired depending on the application and user preference. For an accurate correlation procedure, it is preferable that the extraction percentage remains approximately constant because coffee grinds are composed of a mix of different materials that have different water solubility rates. The materials that have a high water solubility rate are extracted first from the coffee grinds and give the coffee a sweet flavor. Those materials that have a lower water solubility rate are extracted later in the brewing process and give the coffee a bitter flavor. Each of these different materials contained within coffee affect the index of refraction of water differently when they dissolve into it. Therefore for accurate correlation of the index of refraction of coffee to TDS, it is preferred that the extraction percentage is kept approximately constant. Note further that during the described correlation procedure it is preferred that the coffee used to make the different batches of coffee concentrations are from the same green and roast batch, and further, that they are ground to the same grade. For example, all-purpose universal Drip Grind would be derived of 8% Numbers 10/14 sieves, 65% Numbers, 27% Pan for a nominal particle size of 775 Microns (1 Micron−0.001 mm), according to the North American Coffee Industry Norms as published by Modern Process Equipment, Inc. If required, a separate correlation procedure can be conducted for each coffee bean of interest and/or different degrees of roast to determine refractometer correlation equations for these bean and roast changes. For the brew concentrations that have the same extraction percentage, it is preferred that they encompass the range of TDS expected for the consumable coffee of interest. By way of example, the brew samples can span a 0.8% to 4.0% TDS range, since 1% to 1.5% TDS represents the typical range for coffee, and 3% to 4% represents the typical range for ice coffee concentrate. For expresso, the brew concentration of 2 to 6% TDS is typically of interest with the TDS range of 4 to 5% being preferable. For expresso, given that it contains a certain percentage of undissolved solids, these solids would need to be filtered before following the dehydration procedure outlined below. Samples of each brew concentration are allowed to cool in respective sealed vial, as per block 1125 . Refractometer 1000 then measures not only the index of refraction of the sample but also the temperature of the sample. More particularly, refractometer 1000 measures the index of refraction (n s ) for each brew concentration sample across a range of temperatures as per block 1130 . For the correlation of refractometer 1000 for use outside of the brewing machine itself, a temperature range corresponding to ranges of ambient room temperatures are preferred such as 20 to 30° C. and index of refraction measurements can, for example, be taken in 1° C. increments. For a refractometer 1000 to be used to measure the index of refraction of coffee after it is brewed, the desired temperature range may be 70 to 90° C. with measurements taken every 2° C. as part of the correlation process. These correlation measurements are useful to derive the thermal dependence of the index of refraction for a specific brew concentration (i.e., a specific TDS). To determine the TDS of each of the brew concentrations, containers (for example, glass beakers) are marked and weighed (preferable to an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 or better), as per block 1135 (1 st weight reading). Portions of each brewed coffee solution are poured into individual containers (not shown) and the filled containers are reweighed (2 nd weight reading), as per block 1140 . The filled containers are then placed into a dehydration oven, as per block 1145 . After the solutions have been dehydrated or desiccated, the containers are allowed to cool in a dry environment in order to prevent any subsequent moisture absorption, as per block 1150 . The containers are then reweighed (3 rd weight reading) preferably in a dry environment, also as per block 1155 . From these three weight readings, the weight of the dissolved solids and the weight of the original solution is derived, and therefore the TDS (equal to the ratio of these two measurements) is derived. In more detail, assuming eight brewed samples of coffee of different TDS spanning 0.8 to 4.0% and ten temperature readings per sample, 80 data points are thus provided that map a three-dimensional space in TDS, temperature and refractive index. Taking TDS as the dependent variable, the TDS surface plot as a function of temperature and refractive index can be curve fit to find an equation that expresses TDS as a function of index of refraction (n) and temperature (T), (i.e. f(n, T)) as per block 1160 . Generally speaking, the curve fit of such data will be suitably fit by a linear function in index of refraction and a quadratic function of temperature. Curve fitting methods such as least squares, gradient descent, and others methods may be used. See for example, C. Daniel and F. S. Wood, Fitting Equations to Data: Computer Analysis of Multifactor Data , (John Wiley & Sons, NY, N.Y.), 1980] The TDS formula for a fixed temperature T 0 is given by EQUATION 9 below: T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , T 0 ) = [ n ⁡ ( T 0 ) - n 0 ⁡ ( T 0 ) ] C , EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 9 where n 0 is the index of refraction at which the curve fit indicates that the TDS is zero. Note that n 0 may not necessarily correspond with the exact index of refraction measured for pure water. Assuming that the range of index of refraction and hence TDS is relatively small, such as is the case for normal coffee, the constant C can be approximated to be temperature independent. In order to adjust for temperatures, the thermal dependence of index of refraction should be taken into account. The thermal dependence of index of refraction n for a fixed TDS coffee solution is approximated by a quadratic equation in temperature T according to EQUATION 10 below. n=n 0 +a ( T−T 0 )+ b ( T−T 0 ) 2 EQUATION 10 where a and b are constants derived from the curve fitting of data and the index of refraction equation is expressed such that at T=T 0 , the index of refraction is equal to n 0 . To the first order, the TDS formula that takes into account both index of refraction and temperature. for coffee is given by EQUATION 11 below. T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , T ) = [ n - n 01 - a 1 ⁢ ( T - T 0 ) - b 1 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 ] C 1 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 11 where n 01 , a 1 , b 1 , and C 1 may be slightly different from the constants n p , a, b, and C 1 of EQUATIONS. (3) and (4) depending upon the data fit. Although EQUATION 11 may be used, for a more accurate fit of the data, particularly for higher values of TDS, it is preferred to fit the data to a full quadratic in both index of refraction n and temperature T. Although such a quadratic equation can be expressed in multiple forms that are essentially identical from the standpoint of a refractometer's electronics and/or software calculating the result, a convenient form, from the standpoint of person reading the equation is given by EQUATION 12 below. T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , t ) = [ n - n 02 + d 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) 2 - a 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) - b 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 + e 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) ⁢ ( T - T 0 ) ] C 2 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 12 since the TDS is referenced to a control temperature T 0 and the index of refraction of n 02 , which is substantially equal to the index of refraction of pure water at a temperature T 0 , but may deviate slightly depending upon the empirical fit of the data in the index-temperature parameter space of interest. A formula such as the one represented in EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into the firmware 1085 or electronics of refractometer 1000 to correlate refractometer 1000 for the liquids (e.g., coffee), concentrations, and temperatures ranges of interest. In other words, the formula of either EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into, installed or otherwise stored in firmware 1047 of microcontroller 1045 in refractometer 1000 , as per block 1160 , for use in determining TDS of a particular coffee brew sample from index of refraction data and temperature data that refractometer 1000 provides. Storing the TDS formula of EQUATION 11 or 12 in refractometer 1000 in this manner completes the correlation of refractometer 100 for coffee solutions of interest. In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction, but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 or 12 provide respective polynomial expressions that approximate or represent TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATION 11 provides a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 12, TDS(n, T) varies as a quadratic function of index of refraction and also as a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 and 12 both provide a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). It should be noted that the previously cited equations are at a specific measurement wavelength since index of refraction of all materials, including coffee, will vary with the incident wavelength. Typically this wavelength is at or near the Sodium D line of 589 nm. However, other fixed wavelengths are acceptable as well. It is also noted that different coffee varieties, different degree of roasts, different levels of extraction during brew, extraction temperatures, and other brew variables can all affect the correlation to a small degree, such that some correlations of refractive index to brew solids may result in a better fit for darker versus lighter roasts. Separate scales for each range of degree of roasts may be correlated using Agtron or similar methods for determining the degree of roast. Microcontroller 1045 uses temperature sensor 1050 to determine and/or set the temperature of both the prism 1015 and the sample 1020 . Although not shown in FIG. 10A, microcontroller 1045 may control a resistive heater and thermo-electric cooler designed to bring the sample touching the prism face to a desired temperature. Since index of refraction changes with temperature and typically in a non-linear fashion, it is desirable to compensate for temperature effects. As such, in the design of the refractometer 1000 , it is desirable that the angles of incidences of the illumination beam at the entrance face of the prism and of the reflected beam at the exit face be minimized or at least compensated thermally since refraction at these interfaces will be a function of temperature. Likewise, the focal lengths of illumination lens 1010 and collection lens 1030 are a function of wavelength and to thermally compensate the temperature-dependent optical power, the lenses are preferably mounted to a mechanical mount whose thermal expansion compensates for the changes in the optical power of the lenses. Residual thermal changes to the refractometer's ability to measure index of refraction can be compensated using a lookup table based upon the readout of the temperature sensor 1050 that adds a correction factor to the critical angle detected by the refractometer. To increase the resolution of refractometer 1000 , the operating index of refraction range can be reduced and the number of detector pixels increased. Above, as a clarifying example, a refractometer was described that worked for a range of sugar solutions of 0 to 10° BRIX using an Eastman Kodak KLI-2113 linear CCD with 2098 pixels. The resolution for this example was stated as 1.4E-5 in index of refraction and 0.0095° BRIX. If instead, an Eastman Kodak Model KLI-8023 linear CCD having a length of 8002 pixels and the BRIX scale desired were reduced to 0 to 5° BRIX, the resolution can be improved by a factor of 7.6 to 1.8E-6 in index of refraction and 0.0013° BRIX. In an alternate embodiment the linear detector is not increased in size and in fact may be reduced in array size. To achieve a higher resolution the detector is scanned along the beam produced by illumination lens 1030 in order to locate the beam intensity transition point representing the critical angle. In order to properly read out the critical angle, the scanning detector should be mounted to an encoder to that its position is known. FIG. 11B is a flowchart that describes process steps that refractometer 1000 employs to take a TDS reading for a brewed coffee sample. Process flow commences at start block 1170 . The user or other entity may calibrate refractometer 1000 , as per block 1172 . The user or other entity may place a brewed coffee sample in refractometer 1000 for the purpose of taking a TDS % reading via index of refraction measure. Refractometer 1000 takes an index of refraction reading of the brewed coffee sample, as per block 1176 , under the control of firmware 1047 . Microcontroller 1045 reads data from the light received by linear detector 1035 to determine the index of refraction of the brew coffee sample. In one embodiment, microcontroller 1045 of refractometer 1000 takes a temperature reading of the prism-sample interface 1034 , as per block 1178 . Refractometer 100 provides automatic temperature compensation for index of refraction readings of brew coffee samples, as per block 1180 . Refractometer 1000 accesses the TDS formula of EQUATION 11 or 12 that firmware 1047 or memory 1049 stores to determine the TDS % of the brewed coffee sample, as per block 1182 . Refractometer 1000 displays the determined TDS % for the brewed coffee sample on refractometer display 1060 , as per block 1184 . Conveniently, refractometer 1000 provides a TDS % reading directly to the user via display 1060 . Refractometer 1186 then sends the determined TDS % to coffee design application 602 in information handling system 600 for display on the universal brewing control chart, as per block 1186 . As discussed above, refractometer 1000 includes a network interface 1065 that couples to the Internet either by wire or wirelessly, and that may also coupled to another IHS 600 either by wire or wirelessly. In this manner, IHS 600 or another IHS on the Internet may provide updating to onboard firmware 1047 in refractometer 1000 . Refractometer 1000 may also receive updated or new scales via the Internet or IHS 600 in this manner. Refractometer 1000 may employ a wired or wireless connection to send information and data to coffee design application 602 in IHS 600 in this manner.

It concerns a coffee machine according to the preamble to claim 1 . A coffee machine of this type is known, for example, from the publication WO-A1-93/19655. STATE OF THE ART With automatic coffee preparation by means of coffee-making machines or coffee-vending machines, in which the coffee in bean form is first ground in a grinder housed in the machine, the ground coffee powder is then placed in a brewing chamber and compacted therein, pressurized hot water is then supplied through the brewing chamber and, finally, upon completion of the brewing process, the remaining filter cake is pushed out of the brewing chamber and ejected into a collecting container, it is desirable, in spite of the complex preparation steps to be performed, to arrange the machine in a manner such that it is of simple construction, operates for the longest possible periods of time without malfunction or maintenance, and is easy to clean and to maintain. In the publication cited in the introduction, a coffee machine is now proposed, the central element of which is a removable brewing unit ( 1 in FIGS. 1 - 3 ). A base and a plunger are arranged so as to be displaceable along a main axis in this brewing unit and perform different movement sequences that are coordinated with one another. These travels are designed in a manner such that ground coffee powder placed in a filling chamber is transported into an adjacent brewing chamber and is compressed therein between the base and the plunger. Pressurized hot water is then passed through the cylindrical compressed powder in a radial direction. The brewed coffee produced is outlet from the brewing chamber radially and discharged downwards. Upon completion of the brewing process, the remaining filter cake is pushed out of the brewing chamber in an axial direction and is ejected transversely relative to the main axis by means of an ejector. The different travels of the base, of the plunger, and of the ejector are brought about by a common drive unit by means of a special mechanism which includes, amongst other things, two parallel racks engaged by a pinion. For a detailed explanation of the operation, reference should be made to the publication cited. As can be seen from FIGS. 1 and 4 of the publication and from the description on page 4 , last paragraph, the brewing unit is installed with its main axis, which corresponds to the direction of movement of the plunger, arranged transversely in the coffee machine, that is, the main axis extends parallel to the front of the machine. However, this arrangement has various disadvantages: owing to the displaceable arrangement of the base and of the plunger, as well as to the arrangement of the filling chamber, the brewing chamber, and the ejection region longitudinally relative to the main axis, the brewing unit reaches a relatively great length in the direction of the main axis, which length is effective as a width in the transverse installation described. Since, as well as the brewing unit, further functional units such as grinder, drive unit, water-heating unit, water reservoir, filter-cake collecting container, control electronics etc. are housed in the machine and must—at least partially—also be as accessible as possible from the front, the machine as a whole has a comparatively large width which is not always desirable. Basically, it would be possible to design the transversely installed brewing unit so that it could be pushed in from the side. However, in practice, this would mean that sufficient space would always have to remain clear beside the machine to permit unobstructed insertion or removal of the brewing unit. It is therefore usual to insert the transversely installed brewing unit directly transversely from the front and to remove it towards the front. However, the space in front of the brewing unit in the machine must consequently be kept free over the entire width of the brewing unit. A further problem arises in the coupling of the brewing unit, which has been removed and reinserted (for example, after cleaning), to the drive unit, which remains in the machine. In fact if, upon insertion, the movable elements (base, plunger, etc.) of the brewing unit adopt positions other than those adopted upon removal, the engagement point for the coupling is also displaced. An adjustment of the drive unit to the new engagement point, however, is difficult with the transverse installation of the brewing unit. Disadvantages owing to the transverse installation also arise with regard to the water supply: in order to limit, as far as possible, cooling of the brewed coffee on the path from the brewing chamber to the outlet, this path must be kept as short as possible. However, this means a radial flow through the brewing chamber which results in comparatively high flow resistances. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is therefore to provide an automatically operating coffee machine which has a compact brewing unit and which overcomes the disadvantages of known coffee machines and is characterized in particular by a simplified and space-saving design as well as easier accessibility for cleaning and maintenance purposes. The object is achieved by the features of claim 1 , taken as a whole. The essence of the invention is to design the brewing unit so that it can be pushed into the coffee machine from the front towards the rear with the main axis parallel to the direction of insertion. The brewing unit thereby requires only a small width of the machine both inside the machine and also during installation and removal. Moreover, this longitudinal insertion permits the arrangement under the brewing unit of suitable collecting containers which extend along the entire length of the brewing unit and thus offer protection against leakages in the brewing unit. A first preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that one or a plurality of guides, which extend parallel to the main axis of the brewing unit and are preferably bar-shaped, are provided for guiding the brewing unit during insertion in and removal from the coffee machine, and in that a catch is provided at the front end of the guide, for locking the inserted brewing unit. The guide facilitates the accurately positioned insertion of the brewing unit and thus ensures in a simple manner the mechanical and hydraulic connections between the brewing unit and the machine that are necessary for correct operation. A second preferred embodiment of the coffee machine according to the invention is characterized in that, in the brewing unit, the pressurized hot water is forced through the coffee powder disposed in the brewing chamber in the direction of the main axis, forwards from the rear and leaves through an outlet which is arranged at the front end of the brewing unit and is preferably adjustable in height, and in that the movable base and the plunger are equipped, on their surfaces facing the brewing chamber, with respective mesh plates through which the hot water enters the brewing chamber and the brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber, respectively. With the longitudinal configuration of the brewing unit according to the invention, with improved flow through the coffee powder, this enables advantageously short paths for the fluid to be achieved, which is of benefit to the quality of the brewed coffee. Another preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the movable base and the plunger are driven by means of an actuating slide which is arranged so as to be displaceable in the direction of the main axis in the brewing unit and which is releasably in engagement with a driving dog which is situated on a threaded rod arranged parallel to the main axis and which can be displaced along the main axis by rotation of the threaded rod, and in that releasable engagement between the driving dog and the actuating slide is brought about by a latching hook which extends in the direction of the main axis and is arranged so as to be pivotable on the driving dog about a pivot axis arranged transversely relative to the main axis. The engagement between the driven dog and the inserted brewing unit can be re-established easily and automatically thereby, even if the engagement position has changed in the meantime. Particularly simple control of the compacting of the coffee powder can be achieved if, in addition, the threaded rod is mounted so as to be displaceable in the direction of the main axis against the pressure of a spring element, preferably a spring assembly, and if the displacement of the threaded rod against the pressure of the spring element or spring assembly, for a predetermined travel as established by the striking of the driving dog, of the actuating slide, or of the plunger, against a resistance, is used for the control or switching of the drive. The change in density arising in the moistened coffee powder can be compensated for and an optimal brewing process can thereby be ensured if the plunger is moved by means of a plunger actuator displaceable in the direction of the main axis and if the plunger is operatively connected to the plunger actuator by means of compression springs acting in the direction of the main axis. Preferably, the pressurized hot water is supplied into the brewing chamber through the plunger and a valve mechanism is arranged on the plunger, the valve mechanism being closed when the plunger presses on the coffee powder disposed in the brewing chamber with a predetermined pressure and relieving the pressure of the pressurized water and allowing the water to escape to the exterior when the pressure of the plunger on the coffee powder is removed. In particular, this is brought about by virtue of the fact that the valve mechanism includes valve push-rods which are arranged on the plunger actuator and which, upon sufficient compression of the compression springs, sealingly enter corresponding valve bores in the plunger, which valve bores are in communication with a hot-water supply duct. Preferably, the hot-water supply duct can extend directly through one of the valve push-rods and the valve bores can be in communication with the brewing chamber through a mesh plate.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INVENTION In FIG. 1, a coffee machine according to a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in the closed condition, in an overall view from the front. FIG. 2 shows a cross-section through the machine of FIG. 1 in the plane II-II. The coffee machine 10 has, at the top, a loading hopper 11 for the coffee beans to be ground. An associated grinder 24 is arranged beneath the loading hopper 11 . The coffee ground in the grinder 24 falls into a compact brewing unit 18 and is compacted therein in a brewing chamber ( 29 in FIGS. 3, 4). Pressurized hot water is then forced through the compressed powder. The resulting brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber through a spring-loaded creaming valve and is drawn off through an outlet 15 which projects forwards out of the coffee machine 10 and is preferably adjustable in height (pivotable), for example, into a cup which stands on a support surface 14 arranged beneath the outlet 15 . A steam/hot water nozzle 16 is arranged beside the outlet 15 for the foaming of milk (cappuccino) or for delivering hot water. The removable brewing unit 18 is covered at the front by a swivelling or removable cover 17 . An operating console 12 with the necessary operation and control elements is provided for the operation of the machine. A water container 13 that can be pulled out towards the front is arranged beneath the operating console 12 , for storing the water supply. A collecting container 48 for the filter cakes that are produced during the brewing process and are ejected from the brewing chamber is disposed on the left, beside the water container 13 , directly beneath the brewing unit 18 situated behind the cover 17 . The collecting container 48 can be pulled out towards the front by means of a gripping recess 49 . The collecting container 48 extends, together with an extension 50 formed on the rear region, beneath the brewing unit 18 along the entire length of the brewing unit 18 . If any leakages should occur in the brewing unit 18 , the collecting container 48 can thus also collect dripping water or coffee slops which can then easily be removed by pulling out the collecting container 48 together with the collected filter cakes. Permanent soiling of the coffee machine 10 can thus safely be prevented. The brewing unit 18 extends, according to FIGS. 3 and 4, along a main axis 48 . It includes, in addition to a filling chamber 30 and a brewing chamber 29 , a movable base 28 displaceable in the direction of the main axis 48 and a plunger 32 , also displaceable in the direction of the main axis 48 . As described in the publication cited in the introduction, the ground coffee powder falls out of the grinder 24 through a filling opening 31 into the filling chamber 30 . By a displacement of the plunger 32 towards the right (FIG. 3), the loaded coffee powder is pushed from the filling chamber 30 into the brewing chamber 29 where it is pressed against the movable base 28 and thereby compacted. Respective mesh plates 46 and 49 are secured on the end surfaces of the plunger 32 and of the movable base 28 (FIG. 4). Hot water is supplied into the brewing chamber 29 through the mesh plate 46 from the left, in an axial direction, through the plunger 32 . The brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber 29 through the mesh plate 47 , axially towards the right, through the movable base 28 , and reaches the directly adjacent outlet 15 (FIG. 4). The brewing unit 18 is pushed into the coffee machine 10 in the longitudinal direction, that is, in the direction of the main axis 48 , from the front towards the rear (FIG. 2). For guiding the brewing unit 18 during insertion, use is made of one or a plurality of bar-shaped guide(s) 19 on the front end of which a (releasable) catch 20 for the brewing unit 18 is also arranged. The movable base 28 and the plunger 32 are moved, for example, by a rack mechanism as described by way of example in WO-A1-93/19655, of an actuating slide 27 arranged so as to be displaceable in the brewing unit 18 . The actuating slide 27 can be brought into engagement, by means of a releasable latching hook 26 , with a driving dog 25 which is situated on a rotatable threaded rod 21 which is driven by means of a drive wheel 22 of a drive motor, not shown. When the brewing unit 18 is pushed into the coffee machine 10 , the driving dog 25 moves towards the right, with the latching hook 26 , until the latching hook 26 has entered the actuating slide 27 and engaged therein. The engagement between the driving dog 25 and the actuating slide 27 can thus always safely be established, irrespective of exactly where the actuating slide 27 is disposed in the brewing unit 18 during insertion. The threaded rod 21 is arranged parallel to the guide 19 in the coffee machine 10 , is displaceable axially against the pressure of a spring assembly 23 composed of disc springs, and operates a microswitch (not shown) when the driving dog 25 strikes a resistance. In particular if, owing to compaction of the coffee powder, an opposing force builds up on the plunger 32 and thereby also on the driving dog 25 , the microswitch is operated when a predetermined value of that opposing force is exceeded. The compaction process can thus safely be controlled. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the plunger 32 is not coupled rigidly to the drive members but is connected, by means of two compression springs 42 , 43 , to a separate plunger actuator 33 which is driven by the actuating slide 27 . The compression springs 42 , 43 are situated with one end on two spring pins 40 , 41 (see also FIGS. 5 and 7) which are formed on the inner end surface of the plunger 32 . This spring coupling has a particular advantage: when the (dry) coffee powder is compacted, the drive switches off when a predetermined pressure is reached and the plunger actuator 33 and the plunger 32 come to a halt, in the course of which, owing to the prevailing pressure, the compression springs 42 , 43 are compressed to a predetermined extent. If the hot water is now forced through the brewing chamber 29 , owing to the moistening of the coffee powder, the density in the powder increases and the pressure in the powder decreases. The energy stored in the compression springs 42 , 43 then suffices to push the plunger 32 from behind and to compensate for the loss in volume so that the formation of undesired water channels past the coffee powder is safely prevented. The coupling described between the plunger 32 and the plunger actuator 33 by means of the compression springs 42 , 43 permits the simple construction of a valve mechanism which serves for the safe relief of the pressure from the pressurized water system upon completion of the brewing process. For this purpose, valve bores 44 , 45 with parallel axes are provided in the plunger 32 (FIGS. 3, 5 and 6 ); corresponding valve push-rods 36 , 37 arranged on the plunger actuator 33 (FIG. 3) enter the valve bores 44 , 45 sealingly when the compression springs 42 , 43 are sufficiently greatly compressed. Sealing takes place by means of O-rings (not shown) which are inserted in corresponding grooves 38 , 39 on the valve push-rods 36 , 37 . One of the valve push-rods, that is the valve push-rod 36 , also serves as an (axial) supply duct 34 for the hot water. Moreover, connection to the hot water system of the coffee machine 10 is established by means of a fluid-tight plug-type connection 35 which is operated upon the insertion of the brewing unit 18 in the machine. If, upon completion of a brewing process, the plunger actuator 33 with the plunger 32 is withdrawn, the compression springs 42 , 43 are released and the valve push-rods 36 , 37 move out of the valve bores 44 , 45 so that residual pressurized hot water can come out of the supply duct 34 , with pressure relief, into the space between the plunger actuator 33 and the plunger 32 , from where it can be discharged to the exterior.

BACKGROUND ART A latte (caffè latte) is a coffee drink of Italian origin which is made by mixing espresso and milk. In recent years, American style cafeterias have been widespread, and lattes have been popular as a highly palatable beverage in Japan. Further, there have been developed different liquid coffee concentrates for making lanes, which make it possible to easily make at home lattes with a rich taste like those made in cafeterias (e.g., NPLs 1, 2). Meanwhile, caffeine present in coffee may stimulate the central nervous system, the heart or the digestive system such as stomach and intestines. People with high sensitivity to such stimulation of caffeine or with high health consciousness are more likely to avoid caffeine. Thus, decaffeinated coffee beverages from which caffeine is reduced or removed have been developed and commercialized in the market. However, since caffeine is one of the main taste ingredients of coffee, the problem is that when caffeine is reduced or removed from coffee, the kokumi and bitter tastes characteristic of coffee become less noticeable causing a loss of flavor of coffee. Therefore, there have been proposed different techniques of improving the flavor of decaffeinated coffee. Exemplary techniques of improving the flavor of decaffeinated coffee include, but are not limited to, the following: addition of theanine to decaffeinated coffee (PTL 1); incorporation of ethyl isovalerate in decaffeinated coffee (PTL 2); incorporation of potassium sulfate and/or potassium lactate in decaffeinated coffee (PTL 3); addition of a neutral amino acid such as valine, leucine or isoleucine to a decaffeinated coffee matter (PTL 4); and incorporation of a quercetin glycoside in low-caffeine coffee (PTL 5).

Thus, it is important that beverages prepared with addition of milk should have noticeable richness (kokumi taste) and bitterness characteristic of coffee while coffee aroma is not masked. In particular, since liquid concentrates of decaffeinated coffee are low in caffeine as a taste ingredient, the problem is that when such liquid concentrates are diluted with milk, prepared beverages are more likely to lose the inherent aroma of coffee, i.e., rich coffee kokumi taste and unique coffee bitterness lingering in the mouth after drinking (hereinafter also referred to as “bitter aftertaste”). An object of the present invention is to provide a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee intended for use to prepare a beverage that has a reduced caffeine content but does not lose the inherent aroma of coffee, especially the rich kokumi taste and bitter aftertaste of coffee, and which can make one enjoy an authentic latte aroma. Solution to Problem The present inventors found that when the contents of caffeine and acetic acid in a liquid concentrate of decaffeinated coffee are adjusted to be within the specified ranges, a beverage prepared by diluting the liquid concentrate with milk can have enhanced coffee tastes and give an authentic latte aroma without losing the inherent aroma of coffee, i.e., the rich kokumi taste and the bitter aftertaste of coffee. Thus, the inventors have completed the present invention. This invention is directed, but not limited, to the following.

Advantageous Effects of Invention By using the liquid concentrate of decaffeinated coffee of the present invention, there can be prepared a beverage which has a reduced caffeine content but can make one enjoy an authentic latte aroma. The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is also excellent in convenience since a latte having a low caffeine content but an authentic aroma can be easily prepared by simply mixing the liquid concentrate with milk. Further, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is advantageous in that it can be provided easily and inexpensively without the need for special equipment, since it can be prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 depicts a diagram that summarizes the results of Experiments 4 and 5. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS (Liquid Coffee Concentrate and Liquid Concentrate of Low-Caffeine Coffee) As referred to herein, the term “liquid coffee concentrate” refers to a coffee-flavored liquid which is to be diluted to yield a beverage suitable for drinking (hereinafter also referred to simply as “diluted beverage”). As referred to above, the term “coffee-flavored liquid” refers to a liquid having an aroma reminiscent of coffee, and more specifically to a liquid containing a coffee flavor. The coffee flavor will be described later. As referred to herein, the term “liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee” refers to a liquid coffee concentrate whose caffeine is reduced or removed, and more specifically to a coffee-flavored liquid which is to be diluted upon drinking, and which comprises caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g. The dilution factor used to dilute the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be set, as appropriate, according to the preference of a person who drinks a diluted beverage, but is preferably set to be in the range of from 3 to 6 times on a volume ratio basis. To be specific, for example, the dilution by a factor of 3 times on a volume ratio basis means that one volume of a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee is diluted with addition of two volumes of a dilution medium. All dilution factors as indicated herein are expressed on a volume ratio basis. The present invention is based on the discovery that by using a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges, a beverage prepared by diluting the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee can have an enhanced coffee taste. While the activity of acetic acid to enhance coffee tastes will be described later, acetic acid is capable of enhancing the tastes of caffeine present in small amounts. Therefore, it is necessary that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should comprise caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of at least 0.1 mg/100 g, and it is preferred from the viewpoint of reduction of caffeine content that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should comprise caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g. In order to ensure that the effect of this invention can be exhibited more effectively, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should comprise caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.3 to 8 mg/100 g, more preferably at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.5 to 6 mg/100 g, particularly preferably at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.8 to 3 mg/100 g. From another perspective, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention preferably has a ratio of caffeine concentration to coffee solids concentration (caffeine concentration/coffee solids concentration) of not more than 2×10 −3 , more preferably not more than 4×10 −4 . The coffee solids concentration will be described later. The caffeine content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be calculated by multiplying the caffeine content in a diluted beverage by a dilution factor. For example, when the dilution factor used to dilute the liquid coffee concentrate is 4 times, the “liquid coffee concentrate comprising caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g” means a liquid coffee concentrate comprising caffeine at a concentration of from 0.4 to 40 mg/100 g. On this basis, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, should comprise caffeine at a concentration of from 0.3 to 60 mg/100 g, more preferably from 0.9 to 48 mg/100 g, still more preferably from 1.5 to 36 mg/100 g, yet more preferably from 2.4 to 18 mg/100 g. The caffeine content in a liquid coffee concentrate, and the caffeine content in a diluted beverage can be measured by a known method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or the like. The method for adjusting the caffeine content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention to be within a desired range is not particularly limited. In order to achieve reduction of the caffeine content in a liquid coffee concentrate, a liquid coffee extract obtained from a source material composed of coffee beans whose caffeine is removed or reduced may be used, or caffeine may be removed or reduced from an obtained liquid coffee extract. Exemplary methods for removing or reducing caffeine include, but are not limited to: removal of caffeine from refined raw coffee beans; use of decaffeinated coffee beans produced by a plant breeding technique, genetic recombination or the like; selective removal of caffeine from raw coffee beans by immersion in a solvent such as an organic solvent, water, or supercritical fluid carbon dioxide; and adsorptive removal of caffeine from a liquid coffee extract using activated carbon and ion-exchange resins, etc. Such caffeine removal or reduction methods may be used alone or in combination. Conversely, in order to adjust the caffeine content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee to be within a desired range, the caffeine content may also be increased—in such a case, a caffeine preparation acceptable for use in foods and beverages may be added. (Acetic Acid) The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is characterized in that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges is diluted to yield a beverage having enhanced coffee tastes and having a rich kokumi taste and a bitter aftertaste comparable or superior to the aroma of a beverage prepared by diluting a liquid concentrate of non-decaffeinated coffee. Among different acid taste ingredients, acetic acid acts to specifically enhance the tastes of caffeine. The acetic acid content in the liquid coffee concentrate of the present invention is adjusted to a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g, preferably not less than 2 mg/100 g, more preferably not less than 3 mg/100 g, still more preferably not less than 6 mg/100 g. Acetic acid is known to be a volatile acid whose pungent acid odor adversely affects the aroma of coffee. With a view to enhancing the flavor of non-decaffeinated coffee beverages, various treatments have been proposed to reduce acetic acid from coffee beans (e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. JP 2011-97832, and Japanese Domestic Re-publication of PCT International Publication No. JPWO 2005-11396). In this invention, a specified amount of acetic acid is incorporated in a decaffeinated liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee. When the content of acetic acid added is too low, enhancement of the tastes of caffeine may not be achieved to the desired extent. Enhancement of the tastes of caffeine becomes more prominent with the increase of the concentration of acetic acid. However, when the acetic acid concentration in a diluted beverage exceeds 25 mg/100 g, enhancement of the tastes of caffeine reaches the plateau, and moreover the odor and taste of acetic acid may interfere with the desired effects. Therefore, the upper limit of the acetic acid content in the liquid coffee concentrate of the present invention is preferably set to a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not more than 25 mg/100 g, more preferably a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not more than 20 mg/100 g, still more preferably a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not more than 18 mg/100 g. Similarly to the calculation of caffeine content, the acetic acid content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be calculated by multiplying the acetic acid content in a diluted beverage by a dilution factor. For example, when the dilution factor used to dilute the liquid coffee concentrate is 4 times, the “liquid coffee concentrate comprising acetic acid at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g” means a liquid coffee concentrate comprising acetic acid at a concentration of not less than 4 mg/100 g. On this basis, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, should comprise acetic acid at a concentration of not less than 3 mg/100 g, more preferably not less than 6 mg/100 g, still more preferably not less than 9 mg/100 g, yet more preferably not less than 18 mg/100 g. Also, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, should comprise acetic acid at a concentration of not more than 150 mg/100 g, more preferably not more than 120 mg/100 g, still more preferably not more than 108 mg/100 g. The acetic acid content in a liquid coffee concentrate, and the acetic acid content in a diluted beverage can be measured by a common organic acid analysis method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or the like. The concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is also important for achieving the desired effects. To be specific, the concentration ratio [(B)/(A)] is in the range of from 0.7 to 25, preferably from 1 to 20, more preferably from 3 to 15, particularly preferably from 5 to 15. In particular, in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee comprising caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.5 to 6 mg/100 g, the concentration ratio [(B)/(A)] is preferably adjusted to be in the range of from 0.7 to 25, from 1 to 20, from 3 to 15, or from 5 to 15. The acetic acid used in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be of any type as long as it is of a type that can be added to beverages and foods. The acetic acid may be a salt thereof. Also, a crude extract, an extract, or a purified extract obtained from a natural product containing acetic acid ingredients may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate. (Coffee Flavor) The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention comprises a coffee flavor. Exemplary coffee flavors used in this invention include coffee flavorings used as food additives that can be added to beverages, and roasted coffee bean extracts containing coffee aroma components (hereinafter also referred to as “liquid coffee extracts”). A liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee comprising a coffee flavor, wherein the coffee flavor comprises a coffee flavoring and a liquid coffee extract, is one of preferred embodiments of this invention. The present inventors found that addition of a specific amount of acetic acid not only enhances the rich kokumi taste and bitter aftertaste of coffee, but also enhances a nut-like aroma. Therefore, when in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention, the coffee flavor comprises a coffee flavoring, the coffee flavoring preferably comprises a nut-like aroma component. Examples of nut-like aroma components include different types of pyrazines, such as 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine, and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine. Among those pyrazines, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine is an advantageous aroma component since it has a nut-like aroma so that the effects of this invention can be prominently perceived. The type of a coffee flavoring used in the present invention is not particularly limited, and any commercially available coffee flavoring can be used as appropriate without limitation. Some skilled artisans may use the following coffee-related terms differently: i.e., use the term “fragrance” to refer to the aroma of roasted and ground coffee, the term “aroma” to refer to the aroma of a liquid coffee extract, and the term “flavor” to refer to the aroma perceived when liquid coffee is taken into the mouth. However, as used herein, the term “coffee flavoring” even covers flavorings having coffee fragrance and flavorings having coffee aroma. When a coffee favoring is added to the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention, the amount of the coffee flavoring added can be set, as appropriate, in consideration of the titer of the flavoring used, the dilution factor used to dilute the liquid coffee concentrate, and the like. The amount of the coffee flavoring added is generally in the range of approximately from 0.01 to 5.0% by weight, preferably approximately from 0.03 to 4.0% by weight, more preferably approximately from 0.05 to 3.0% by weight, still more preferably approximately from 0.1 to 1.5% by weight, based on the amount of the liquid coffee concentrate. In the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention, the coffee flavor may comprise a liquid coffee extract. As referred to herein, the term “liquid coffee extract” refers to a solution extracted from roasted and ground coffee beans with water, hot water or the like, and also covers a coffee essence obtained by concentrating a liquid coffee extract, and a solution adjusted to a proper volume by adding water, hot water or the like to a solid dry matter obtained by drying a liquid coffee extract. The type of coffee beans used to make a liquid coffee extract is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include, but are not limited to, Blue Mountain, High Mountain, Jamaica, Crystal Mountain, Guatemala Antigua, Colombia Supremo, Mocha Harar, Mocha Mattari, Kilimanjaro, Toraja, Kalosi, Gayo Mountain, Mandheling, Brazil, and Hawaii Kona. Exemplary coffee bean species include, but are not limited to, Arabica and Robusta . One type of coffee beans may be used alone, or two or more types thereof may be blended and used. Such raw coffee beans are roasted in a coffee roaster, and the thus-roasted coffee beans can be used as a source material to make a liquid coffee extract. The roasting can be carried out by, for example, introducing raw coffee beans into the interior of a rotary drum and heating the beans from the bottom of the drum with a gas burner or the like while stirring by rotating the drum. With regard to the degree of roasting of such coffee beans, the beans are roasted to an L-value of approximately from 14 to 30. Since the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is intended for use to prepare a latte, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate should have a taste reminiscent of espresso. In general, coffee beans become stronger in bitterness and kokumi taste as they are roasted more deeply—thus, deeply roasted coffee beans (with a L-value of approximately from 14 to 22, preferably approximately from 15 to 20) are generally used to make espresso. Similarly, in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, deeply roasted coffee beans are preferably used as a source material to make a liquid coffee extract. As referred to above, the L-value is an indicator that reflects the degree of coffee roasting, and is a value of the brightness of a ground powder of roasted coffee beans as measured by a chronometer (0 represents black and 100 represent white). The method for extracting a liquid coffee extract from roasted coffee beans is not limited at all. For example, roasted coffee beans are ground to coarse, medium or fine grind, and ground coffee beans are extracted with water or hot water (at 0 to 200° C.) for a period of 10 seconds to 30 minutes. The extraction method can be selected, as appropriate, from known methods such as drip extraction, siphon extraction, boiling extraction, jet extraction, and continuous column extraction. For example, column extraction can be carried out by loading coffee beans into a column type extractor and supplying water or hot water to the extractor. In this method, multistep extraction may also be employed. As referred to above, the “multistep extraction” refers to an extraction process using an apparatus having independent extraction columns connected in series by pipings. The multistep extraction is an advantageous extraction process from the viewpoint of aroma, since in this process, a liquid extract having a high coffee solids content comparable to that of a liquid concentrate can be recovered without taking a concentration step. It is acceptable that a liquid comprising such a coffee flavor as described above may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate serving as a base to make the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention (hereinafter also referred to as “liquid coffee concentrate base”), and that the caffeine concentration, the acetic acid concentration, and the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid coffee concentrate base may be adjusted to be within the specified ranges, thereby to prepare the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention. In another instance, it is also acceptable that such a liquid coffee extract as described above may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate base as it is, and that the caffeine concentration, the acetic acid concentration, and the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid coffee concentrate base may be adjusted to be within the specified ranges, thereby to prepare the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention. In still another instance, it is also acceptable that such a liquid coffee extract as described above may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate base as it is, and that the caffeine concentration, the acetic acid concentration, and the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid coffee concentrate base may be adjusted to be within the specified ranges, and a coffee flavoring may be further added as required, thereby to prepare the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention. When the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention comprises a liquid coffee extract, it is preferred that the coffee solids concentration in the liquid coffee extract should be adjusted to be in the range of from 5 to 12% by weight. Further, when the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention comprises a liquid coffee extract, it is preferred that the liquid coffee extract should be present in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee at a concentration sufficient to ensure that the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee is in the range of from 5 to 12% by weight. A liquid coffee extract having a coffee solids concentration of from 5 to 12% by weight may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate base either as it is or as diluted to an appropriate volume, and may be made into a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee having a coffee solids concentration of from 5 to 12% by weight. As referred to herein, the term “coffee solids”, as in e.g. such a liquid coffee extract as described above, refers to the weight (g) of soluble solids in the liquid coffee extract, which is determined from a sugar refractometer index (Brix) reading at 20° C. To be specific, the weight (g) of coffee solids in the liquid coffee extract is determined by measuring a sugar refractometer index (Brix) of the liquid coffee extract using a sugar refractometer (e.g., RX-5000 produced by Atago Co., Ltd.) and multiplying the Brix reading by the amount (g) of the liquid coffee extract used for measurement. As referred to herein, the term “coffee solids concentration” refers to a coffee solids concentration (% by weight) calculated based on the weight (g) of coffee solids determined by the above procedure. To be specific, the coffee solids concentration (% by weight) in a liquid coffee extract can be determined by calculating the percentage of the weight of coffee solids determined by the above procedure relative to the weight of the liquid coffee extract. Also, the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be determined by the same procedure as described above. Additionally, such a Brix value as described above may be used to refer to the coffee solids concentration in the liquid coffee extract or liquid coffee concentrate in this invention. When the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is not less than 5% by weight (preferably not less than 6% by weight), a beverage prepared by diluting the liquid concentrate with milk by a factor of from 3 to 6 times is more likely to have noticeable tastes inherent in coffee, and the rich kokumi taste and bitterness inherent in coffee can be enhanced more strongly by adding acetic acid in the amount specified above. It is preferred from the viewpoint of aroma that the upper limit of the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should be not more than 12% by weight, more preferably not more than 11% by weight, particularly preferably not more than 10% by weight. (Other Components) From the viewpoint that the effects of the present invention can be prominently exhibited, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention preferably has a pH of from 5.0 to 7.0, more preferably from 5.0 to 6.0, still more preferably from 5.3 to 6.0. The pH adjustment can be made using a common pH adjustor such as sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium hydroxide. In addition to the components described above, other components may be added, as appropriate, to the extent that such other components do not impair the effects of this invention—examples of such other components include, but are not limited to, sweeteners (e.g., sucrose, isomerized sugar, glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, aspartame, acesulfame K, sucralose, and stevia ), antioxidants (e.g., sodium L-ascorbate), emulsifiers (e.g., sucrose fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyglycerol fatty acid esters), acidulants, and flavorings. (Dilution Medium) Any type of dilution medium can be used to dilute the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention as long as such a dilution medium is a liquid acceptable for use in foods and beverages, with milk being preferably used as a dilution medium. The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is characterized in that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges is diluted with a dilution medium to yield a beverage having enhanced coffee tastes and having a rich kokumi taste and a bitter aftertaste comparable or superior to the aroma of a beverage prepared by diluting a non-decaffeinated liquid coffee concentrate. Therefore, even when the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is mixed with plenty of milk, it is possible to prepare a beverage having a rich kokumi taste and a pronounced bitter taste (esp., bitter aftertaste) of coffee, without being masked by milk. As described above, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is advantageously used as a liquid concentrate which is to be diluted with milk. As referred to herein, the term “milk” refers to a white liquid containing fine colloidal particles of protein and fat that can mask the aroma of coffee if used as they are, and includes animal milks such as cow's milk, and vegetable milks such as soybean milk, almond milk, rice milk, and coconut milk. (Method for Preparing a Liquid Concentrate of Low-Caffeine Coffee) In another aspect, the present invention is also directed to a method for preparing a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee intended for use to prepare a beverage that has a reduced caffeine content but does not lose the inherent aroma of coffee, especially the rich kokumi taste and bitter aftertaste of coffee, and which makes one feel an authentic latter aroma. To be specific, the present invention is directed to a method for preparing a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, the method comprising the steps of: (i) adding caffeine (A) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g; (ii) adding acetic acid (B) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g; (iii) adjusting a concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range from 0.7 to 25; and (iv) adding a coffee flavor. EXAMPLES Hereunder, the present invention will be specifically described in detail by reference to experimental examples, but this invention is not limited to these examples. Unless otherwise stated herein, all numerical ranges are inclusive of their endpoints. In working examples presented herein, the amounts of components in beverage samples were measured by following the procedures described below. <Measurement of Caffeine Concentration> In order to quantify caffeine concentration, different samples were diluted by 10 times (w/w) with mobile phase A, filtered through a membrane filter (produced by Advantec Co., Ltd.; cellulose acetate type; pore size: 0.45 μm), and injected into HPLC.

Reference material: Caffeine (anhydrous) (produced by Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) <Measurement of Acetic Acid Concentration> In order to quantify acetic acid concentration, different samples were mixed with 0.5% perchloric acid, diluted with ion-exchange water to increase volume, filtered through a membrane filter (produced by Advantec Co., Ltd.; cellulose acetate type; pore size: 0.45 μm), and injected into HPLC. The HPLC measurement conditions are as follows. Model: LC-20AD (produced by Shimadzu Corporation) Detector: Electrical conductivity detector CDD-10AVP (produced by Shimadzu Corporation) Column: Shim-pack SCR-102H×2, 8 mmφ×300 mm (produced by Hitachi Kasei Kyogyo K. K.) Mobile phase: An aqueous solution of 5 mmol/L p-toluenesulfonic acid Reaction solution: An aqueous solution obtained by diluting p-toluenesulfonic acid with water to yield a p-toluenesulfonic acid concentration of 5 mmol/L, and containing 20 mmol/L of Bis-Tris and 0.1 mmol/L of EDTA Flow rate: Mobile phase: 0.8 mL/min.; reaction solution: 0.8 mL/min. Column temperature: 45° C. Injection volume: 10 μL [Experiment 1] Different beverage samples prepared by diluting liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with milk were investigated for the relationship between acetic acid concentration and the intensities of kokumi, bitterness and aroma. First, liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee were prepared. A caffeine extract (produced by Shiratori Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and a commercial coffee flavoring comprising pyrazines were added to ion-exchange water to give a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee having such final concentrations of caffeine and coffee flavoring as indicated in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 1. Further, varied amounts of acetic acid powder (produced by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was added to prepare liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee having such different acetic acid concentrations as shown in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 1. When the pH fell below 5.0, the pH was adjusted to from 5.0 to 5.5 with sodium hydrogen carbonate. These liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee having different acetic acid concentrations were diluted with milk by five times (coffee-flavored liquid:milk=1:4) to obtain different latte-flavored beverages having a caffeine concentration of 2 mg/100 g and a coffee solids concentration of 0%. The obtained latte-flavored beverage samples were subjected to sensory evaluation by five trained professional panelists. With a sample prepared with no addition of acetic acid (sample No. 1-1) being used as a control, the samples were rated on whether they tasted close to latte, i.e., a mixed beverage of espresso and milk. To be specific, the individual panelists on their own first evaluated the samples on the kokumi taste (i.e., whether pronounced coffee richness was felt), bitterness (i.e., whether pronounced coffee bitterness was felt), and aroma (i.e., whether pronounced coffee aroma was felt) of coffee. Those samples evaluated by all the five panelists as being closer in flavor to latte than the control were rated as “∘”, those evaluated by 3 or 4 panelists as being closer in flavor to latte than the control were rated as “Δ”, and those evaluated by 2 or less panelists as being closer in flavor to latte than the control (including those evaluated by all the panelists as being similar in flavor to the control) were rated as “x”. The results are shown in Table 1. When latte-flavored beverage samples prepared by 5-fold dilution with plenty of milk contained acetic acid at concentrations of not less than 1 mg/100 g, they were closer in flavor to latte, with the mellow and thick mouthfeel characteristic of milk, and the tastes (kokumi and bitterness) and aroma (esp., nut-like aroma) of coffee being enhanced with an increase of acetic acid concentration.

First, different liquid coffee concentrates were prepared by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1, except that caffeine was added to give such varied concentrations as indicated in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Tables 2-1 to 2-4. The prepared liquid coffee concentrates were diluted with milk by five times, and the diluted beverages were subjected to sensory evaluation by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1, with those acetic acid-free samples with different caffeine concentrations (sample Nos. 2-1, 2-4, 2-7, 2-10, 2-13, 2-16, 2-19, 2-22) being used as controls. The results are shown in Table 2. In those diluted beverage samples with a caffeine concentration of less than 0.1 mg/100 g (sample Nos. 2-2, 2-3, 2-5, 2-6), no enhancement of coffee tastes and aroma by acetic acid was observed. Also, in those diluted beverage samples with a caffeine concentration exceeding 10 mg/100 g (sample Nos. 2-20, 2-21), no enhancement of coffee tastes and aroma by acetic acid was observed, since these samples had adequate coffee flavor even in the absence of acetic acid. These results revealed that in order that the effects of the present invention can be effectively exhibited, caffeine is required to be present at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage with a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g.

Phosphoric acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate were added in appropriate amounts to sample No. 1-5 (pH 5.5) as prepared in Experiment 1 to give different liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with different pH values of from 4.0 to 7.5. Different control samples with different pH values were also prepared with no addition of acetic acid. The liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee and control samples prepared above were diluted with milk by five times and subjected to sensory evaluation by following the same procedures as in Experiment 1. Those liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with a pH of less than 5.0 flocculated and aggregated when mixed with milk. In these samples, no pronounced enhancement of caffeine tastes was observed even with addition of acetic acid—this is presumably because as aggregation progressed, coffee tastes and aroma became less perceivable. With regard to those liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with a pH exceeding 7.0, the beverage samples prepared from those liquid concentrates were indistinct in overall tastes and less noticeable in coffee and milk tastes, and many of the panelists evaluated that no significant enhancement of caffeine tastes by addition of acetic acid was observed like in the case of those liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with a pH of from 5.0 to 6.0 or from 5.3 to 6.0, although some of the panelists evaluated that these beverage samples had an enhanced coffee sensation. [Experiment 4] Different beverage samples prepared by dilution with milk of liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee prepared from a mixture of a liquid coffee extract and a coffee flavoring were investigated for the relationship between acetic acid concentration and the intensities of kokumi, bitterness and aroma. First, a liquid extract of low-caffeine coffee was prepared. To be specific, commercial roasted coffee beans (L-value 18) decaffeinated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction were employed and treated with steam by following the procedure disclosed in Example 3 of Japanese Domestic Re-publication of PCT International Publication No. JPWO 2005-11396, thereby to obtain decaffeinated, steamed and roasted coffee beans. The obtained roasted coffee beans were ground to medium grind, loaded into a multistage column extractor, and extracted in a multistep process with addition of hot water to obtain a liquid coffee extract with a Brix (i.e., coffee solids concentration) of 12%. The obtained liquid coffee extract was diluted with water to give a liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5%. This liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5% was used as a liquid coffee concentrate base to make different liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with a coffee solids concentration of 5%. To be specific, the above prepared liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5%, acetic acid as used in Experiment 1, and a coffee flavoring comprising pyrazines (different from the one used in Experiment 1) were mixed according to the prescriptions shown in Table 3-1, and adjusted to pH 5.3 to 6.0 with sodium hydrogen carbonate to prepare different liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee (sample Nos. 4-1 to 4-7) containing the different components in such amounts as shown in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 3-1. In order to provide a control sample, 9 mg/100 g of caffeine and 0.3 g/100 g of the above coffee flavoring were added to ion-exchange water to prepare a control liquid concentrate sample of low-caffeine coffee which contained no liquid coffee extract but had the same caffeine and coffee flavoring concentrations. The liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with different acetic acid concentrations, and the control liquid concentrate sample of low-caffeine coffee as prepared above were diluted with milk by four times (liquid coffee concentrate:milk=1:3) to obtain different latte-flavored beverage samples. Separately, the liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5% was mixed with 20 mg/100 g of caffeine used in Experiment 1 and further with the above coffee flavoring to prepare different liquid concentrate samples of high-caffeine coffee (sample Nos. 4-8 to 4-10) containing the different components in such amounts as shown in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 3-2. Further, as a control sample, a liquid concentrate of high-caffeine coffee containing no liquid coffee extract but having the same caffeine and coffee flavoring concentrations was prepared. The liquid concentrate samples of high-caffeine coffee with different acetic acid concentrations, and the control liquid concentrate sample of high-caffeine coffee as prepared above were diluted with milk by four times (liquid coffee concentrate:milk=1:3) to obtain different latte-flavored beverage samples. The above-prepared latte-flavored beverages were subjected to sensory evaluation in comparison with the control beverage samples with the same caffeine and coffee flavoring concentrations, by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1. The results are shown in Tables 3-1 and 3-2. When the liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee containing caffeine at low concentrations sufficient to yield diluted beverages having a caffeine concentration within the range of from 1 to 10 mg/100 g (e.g., 2.3 mg/100 mg) were adapted by adjusting the concentration of acetic acid (B) to a concentration sufficient to yield diluted beverages having an acetic acid (B) concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g, and by adjusting the ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range of from 0.7 to 11, the latte-flavored beverage samples prepared by diluting these liquid concentrate samples had noticeable and pronounced coffee richness and bitterness, and also had an aroma reminiscent of mellow coffee like espresso. From these results combined with the results in Table 2, it was found to be preferable to adjust the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range of from 0.7 to 25.

These liquid coffee extracts with coffee solids concentrations of 2%, 9% and 12% were respectively used as liquid coffee concentrate bases to make different liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with coffee solids concentrations of 2%, 9% and 12%. To be specific, by following the same procedure as in Experiment 4, these liquid coffee extracts with different coffee solids concentrations were mixed with a coffee flavoring and varied concentrations of acetic acid according to the prescriptions indicated in Tables 4-1 and 4-2, whereby different liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with different coffee solids and acetic acid concentrations were obtained. The obtained liquid concentrates were diluted with milk by four times, and subjected to sensory evaluation by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1. The results are shown in Tables 4-1 and 4-2. When the liquid coffee concentrate samples containing caffeine derived from a liquid coffee extract at low concentrations sufficient to yield diluted beverages having a caffeine concentration of from 1 to 10 mg/100 g were adapted by adjusting the concentration of acetic acid (B) to a concentration sufficient to yield diluted beverages having an acetic acid (B) concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g, and by adjusting the ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range of from 0.7 to 25, especially from 3 to 15, the latte-flavored beverage samples prepared from these liquid concentrate samples had noticeable and pronounced coffee richness and bitterness, and also had an aroma reminiscent of mellow coffee like espresso. FIG. 1 depicts a diagram that summarizes the results in Experiments 4 and 5. In this FIGURE, the filled circles “●” represent beverages evaluated by the professional panelists as having particularly noticeable coffee richness and bitterness. The panelists evaluated that these latte-flavored beverages gave a long coffee aftertaste after swallowing, and left pleasant coffee kokumi and bitter tastes that lingered in the mouth for a long time.

In addition a new type of packaging for coffee is disclosed that maintains the freshness of the bean while allowing easy distribution and verification of bean authenticity. BACKGROUND Coffee has traditionally been made using a three step process: roasting of coffee beans, grinding of roasted beans, and brewing of ground beans in hot water to extract the flavor into a beverage. These three steps are traditionally done at different times and locations. Roasting is typically done in large industrial machines in large batches of many pounds to hundreds of pounds at a time. Roasted beans or ground beans are shipped to local retailers and this step can take weeks to months before the package arrives for the consumer to brew, where the consumer may be the retail home consumer or other businesses such as coffee shops that brew and sell coffee. Roasted beans decay in freshness and taste from the moment the roast is completed as chemical compounds formed in the bean during roasting deteriorate. The decay of roasted beans leads to a less desirable taste of coffee. Thus all coffee made today is stale due to the time delay from roasting to brewing. SUMMARY Embodiments of a coffee preparation machine include at least one pod containing coffee beans, a roasting system that accepts the at least one sealed pod, a grinding system, and a brewing system, where the brewing system, the roasting system, and the grinding system are housed within a single self-contained unit.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The taste of coffee is determined by the type of coffee beans used and by numerous process parameters in each step of making the coffee beverage. A key set of parameters influencing coffee taste, happen during roasting. The roast process is typically done in an industrial batch setting as described above and the end consumer has no control over the roast process and, thus, the taste of the coffee beverage as determined by bean roast. Additionally, the degree of roasting for each bean type can transform the taste of the final coffee beverage to an individual consumer's liking, yet this degree of control does not exist in the coffee industry today. A consumer may buy prepackaged beans with different degrees of roast but the user cannot dial-in and control the roast of beans to taste. Coffee has evolved in recent years from a widespread commodity product with ‘generic’ tasting coffee products to specialty coffee where specific beans, origin location, microclimates, growing conditions, year of production, and processing conditions are tracked and marketed. These variations in the source beans affect the taste of the coffee beverage and, thus, are tracked and marketed to the final consumer. Coffee has many aromatic compounds that affect aroma and taste, where coffee contains more aromatic compounds than wine. Just as wine is marketed by region, year, vineyard, etc., with varying prices for each, coffee can be marketed similarly. A key issue with such marketing is assuring the end consumer that the product being purchased is genuine and not counterfeit. This allows the consumer to know the value of his purchase and to possibly sell that product in the future for value that may increase or decrease. To solve these and other problems we describe a series of embodiments that allow the preparation of the freshest and best tasting coffee ever made. The solution to the problems stated above is to change the method of coffee preparation at the consumer side and to change the distribution method of green coffee beans from plantation to consumer. Coffee Bean Verification Coffee plants are grown in approximately fifty countries worldwide, typically in the tropical regions of the world, at high elevations. The coffee cherry is picked from the plant and after several process steps, dried green coffee beans are produced, These beans can vary widely in quality and taste leading to a large difference in price. Commodity green coffee beans are priced at approximately $2/pound and traded on international commodity markets. Specialty green coffee beans with specific taste and terroir have sold for up to $500/lb. However it is difficult for a person to determine the origin of a green bean by physical observation and, thus, expensive beans may be counterfeited. To prevent counterfeiting, several new embodiments are proposed. As shown in FIG. 1, one embodiment includes laser marking each coffee bean 10 with a laser 12 to create a custom code that is difficult or impossible to copy. A key feature here is to mark the surface of bean only without damage to the inside of the bean. An alternate embodiment includes mechanical marking (not shown) of the surface of each bean with a specific code without damaging the inside of the bean. Embodiments include the application of visual marking material (not shown) to a coffee bean in a custom pattern that cannot be copied. This may include fluorescent materials that emit only when stimulated with the proper external optical stimulus. These materials may be organic (e.g., a green fluorescent protein or other materials) or inorganic. Of key importance is to use only biologically safe materials and materials that burn off during coffee roasting leaving no trace in appearance or taste. In one embodiment, DNA sequencing of beans can be performed on reference bean samples from desired locations. This sequence data can be stored and compared to DNA sequence data of the green coffee beans at a later date to verify location of the bean. DNA can survive in the green coffee bean state, but degrades rapidly with increasing temperature (DNA denatures at just below 100C). Thus, keeping beans in the green state until final consumption aids verification. Once the beans are roasted, extracting DNA sequence information from the bean becomes difficult or impossible. Such embodiments may provide a novel approach to provenancing. A unique feature of the coffee preparation method embodiments described below is that the roasting is performed at the time of final beverage preparation by the consumer and thus these anti-counterfeiting methods will maintain their integrity through the distribution chain of coffee until the final preparation when verification testing can be performed, if desired. Traditional coffee preparation involves roasting at an earlier stage, as described above, and all marking methods would be destroyed during roasting. A key parameter in specialty coffee is to validate the origin and terroir (special characteristics of the geography, geology and climate of a certain place) that affect coffee taste. This comes under the terminology of food provenancing (chronology of the ownership or location of a historical object). Embodiments include using spectroscopic methods to verify provenance of coffee beans by measuring spectroscopic data (e.g., molecular compounds, ratios of different elements, etc.) as close to the source location as possible and creating a library of coffee bean spectroscopic data. This library of data is used to compare with later spectroscopic measurements for verification when the provenance of any bean is called into question. Spectroscopic techniques to be used may include mass spectrometry, laser spectroscopy, LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy), ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), or any other methods. A key feature of this invention is the use of spectroscopic signature to verify provenance to the location of coffee bean growth and the subsequent ability to verify beans after packaging into coffee pods. By keeping the beans in the green state, this spectroscopic information can be extracted, whereas this information may be destroyed at the temperatures of coffee roasting. Coffee Pod Embodiments A growth area in the coffee market is the use of single-serve coffee pods for consumer preparation of coffee in one cup portions. Advantages of coffee pods include convenience, single serve preparation so that coffee does not sit aging in pots, and ability for consumer to choose amongst pod types. For these reasons, coffee brewing machines using pods have exploded in sales growth in the last decade (e.g., SENSEO, NESPRESSO, KEURIG, etc.). These coffee pods typically are small plastic or metal containers with ground coffee and filter paper inside. These coffee machines and pods all use ground coffee and the machines only brew the coffee. As noted above, coffee degrades in freshness from the moment it is roasted, and degrades even more rapidly once it is ground, since increased surface area interacts with atmosphere. Embodiments include a new type of coffee pod in which green coffee beans are packaged into small enclosed containers or pods, where each pod (e.g., pod 14 shown in FIG. 13) contains enough green coffee beans to ultimately produce one serving of coffee. The pod 14 may be hermetically sealed with a seal 37 . These pods can be used with a specially designed coffee preparation machine that is described herein. The novelty here is to use green coffee beans that have a long shelf life and do not degrade rapidly (shelf life of green coffee beans is years or more if stored properly). The coffee pod 14 is filled with a gas to preserve the enclosed beans without degradation to long periods (years to many years), This fill gas may be atmospheric air, nitrogen, inert gas, noble gas, or the pod 14 may be vacuum packed. In some cases the pod 14 may be filled with positive pressure gas (e.g., nitrogen, noble gas, or others). Each pod 14 would contain approximately 10-50 grams of green coffee beans. In certain cases, certain beans are known to improve with age and exposure to air, where pods 14 containing such beans may be packaged with a ‘breathable membrane’ (not shown) that allows air to be exchanged with the outside world. A further embodiment is to sort and package the green beans with beans of a similar size and color packaged into a single pod 14 , and likewise do this for all pods 14 . The value of this sorting is that roasting of all beans within a single pod will progress similarly when exposed to heat and thus produce a uniform roast. This sorting system may also sort out bad beans that may have phenol content or other impurities that impair taste of the final beverage. Further value of this sorting will become apparent in the discussion of the machine below. The pod 14 can be marked with an information code 38 or bar code (not shown) that contains information about the beans in the pod 14 . This information can be used by the machine described below and will: allow the machine to verify the authenticity of the coffee pod and prevent fake pods from working in the machine, and encode bean information and optimum preparation recipe instructions that the machine can read. The information code may be printed in some form not visible to naked eye to preserve the aesthetic appeal of the pod 14 . The pod 14 may have features built into the design that either prevent tampering with the pod or indicate if tampering has occurred. Other features in the pod package may be deliberately designed to be hard to reproduce to act as anti-counterfeit measures. The pod 14 may be made of recyclable materials. The pod 14 may have features in the physical design to allow non-invasive measurement of the spectral features of the beans to verify provenance of the bean as described above. The pod 14 would be designed in conjunction with the machine described below so that the pod 14 fits into the machine and the machine automatically opens the pod 14 so the green coffee beans can be accessed for processing without contaminating the machine or green beans with remnants of the packaging material. A key goal of the pod 14 and packaging methods mentioned above is to create a pod 14 that is designed for long life of the enclosed beans without bean degradation. In particular, the goal is to create the ecosystem for storing, collecting, trading, and consuming specialty green coffee beans that can be turned into a coffee beverage in an analogous manner to how fine wine is collected, stored, traded, and ultimately consumed. Fine wine may go up or down in value as the provenance of the specific wine gains or loses reputation amongst collectors of wine, and due to supply and demand constraints. Similarly, fine green coffee beans have analogous taste and aroma characteristics that cannot be artificially duplicated, so a limited supply of specialty beans can create a tradable value amongst connoisseurs. The purpose of high quality pod packaging described is to create a long lasting product (lasting years, decades, or longer) that enables a green coffee bean ecosystem to evolve just like the fine wine ecosystem. The coffee pods may be purchased for near term consumption or may be purchased for long term collectible value. The pod 14 may contain green unroasted coffee beans where some processing step has been performed on the beans. One method may be to grind the beans in a factory setting and package the ground green beans into the pod 14 . Grinding the beans first may help in faster roasting of beans (described below in the machine section). Another option may be to partially roast green coffee beans and package into the pod 14 , which may save roasting time for the final consumer. However this partial roasting should be done in a way that preserves the freshness of the bean and prevents the decaying/staleness of the bean as in conventional roasting. E-Commerce Embodiments The coffee machine 16 (FIG. 8) described herein will have an internet connection and can upload and download information to or from computer servers attached to the internet. These servers may be owned and maintained by the company selling the coffee making machine and would provide numerous functions. The company would also maintain a website that would allow the sale of coffee preparation machines and coffee pods 14 . The website would also have information to educate the consumer about the coffee pods and the provenance/terroir of the coffee pods. This information can include professional tasting ratings, user generated feedback forums on taste, and information about the source of each pod 14 . A novel function of the website is allowing the auctioning or trading of coffee pods since the pods are designed to be collectible and may go up or down in value based on supply and demand. This portion of the website may function something like an EBAY for coffee pods, though a number of different auction methods may be used. This auction website may offer an additional service to buyer and seller to verify the pods for authenticity, non-tampering of pod, no air leak of the pod; etc. The pods 14 will be sold with optimized preparation recipes encoded (explained more below in the machine section). However, the consumer may choose to experiment with process parameters to suite individual taste, The user may decide to upload their personal recipe for a specific pod type to the website for free access by all, or may choose to upload the recipe and charge others for access. The website would handle the transaction and take a percentage of sale price for facilitating transaction. Along similar lines, there may be chefs, celebrities, or others who may wish to create branded recipes specific to each type of pod 14 . The website would facilitate the exchange and/or sale of these recipes (e.g., a Wolfgang Puck recipe for Guatemalan Finca bean, an Usain Bolt recipe for Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, etc.). This could be considered an analogy to how app stores have evolved for software on mobile phones except in this case it is an ‘app store’ for recipes for coffee preparation. Coffee Preparation Machine Embodiments The coffee preparation machine 16 is a key to the inventions described above and all the pieces described work together. Here we describe the inventions in coffee preparation enabled by the new coffee machine 16 . Coffee preparation involves three keys steps: 1) roast green beans, 2) grind beans, 3) brew coffee. In all previous cases, roasting is done separately from grinding and brewing. Coffee machines exist on the market that brew coffee from ground coffee, coffee machines exist that grind roasted beans and brew coffee, and coffee machines exist that brew single serve coffee from coffee grounds packaged in pods, however, all of these machines require roasted coffee beans that have been roasted separately as mentioned previously. Here we describe for the first time a coffee machine 16 that encompasses roasting, grinding, and brewing in a single machine. The green coffee beans for this machine 16 are provided to the machine 16 in a standardized single serve pod 14 described above. Thus this machine 16 is a single serve roast/grind/brew machine that provides the user control over every step of the coffee preparation process and the freshest coffee ever made. Typically roasting of coffee beans is performed on large scale machines and can take up to 10-20 minutes per batch. Here, we describe technology to enable fast roasting of green beans in small quantity in less than three minutes so that the user does not have to wait a long time for coffee. We believe that delivering the ultimate cup of coffee to the consumer in a few minutes is key to enabling a viable machine since the user would not wait the 10-20 minute roast time of traditional roasting to get a cup of coffee. The features of this machine are novel and describe a new invention in the coffee industry. This machine 16 may be used in any number of professional/restaurant settings or may be used in the home. Roasting Process The traditional sequence of coffee making is to roast green beans, grind beans, and brew coffee. An alternative approach is to grind the green beans, roast the ground beans, and brew coffee. This alternative sequence is not done in any coffee making machine and thus is novel. The purpose of the alternative approach is that the green beans are ground to a small size, which results in more surface area exposed to heat during roasting and enabling faster, more uniform, heat transfer throughout the green bean particles. This allows more uniform roasting and faster roasting, both of which are desirable. Variations on this concept can include 1) coarse grind green coffee beans, 2) roast coarse grind beans, 3) fine grind the roasted particles, 4) brew coffee. Other slight variations in this sequence should be considered part of the novelty we suggest. Typically the three steps in making coffee mentioned above (roast, grind, brew) are done as three separate discrete steps. However, we propose a novel concept of partial or complete overlapping of these steps in time or space to reduce the total time required to make coffee. For example, the roasting and grinding may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may begin as some beans are roasted. Another example is that grinding and brewing may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may occur in a wet grind process which initiates the brewing process. Other variations of combining process steps can occur and we consider the concept of combining process steps in a single coffee making machine to be novel. The machine, such as machine 16 shown in FIG. 10, may have an array of sensors 18 built in to measure process parameters along with feedback control systems to optimize the performance of each step the machine 16 performs (i.e., roast, grind, brew). For roasting such sensors may include a camera/color sensor to determine color change of beans during roasting, a humidity/water sensor to measure the water content in a roasting chamber 30 , a humidity sensor for ambient local air, a carbon dioxide sensor to measure CO2 emission during roasting, an optical spectroscopy system to measure chemical emissions during roasting, a temperature and time measurement along with roast profile control, and a microphone sensor to listen for first crack of the beans, second crack of the beans, and other noise emissions during roasting. For grinding, sensors 218 may include optical sensors to visually monitor grind size, use of a vibration sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) to monitor progress of grinding, a microphone to measure noise from grinder to determine grind size, etc. Since the grind process makes audible noise, it may be possible to use active noise canceling techniques along with an embedded audio speaker to mute or minimize the noise generated by the grinder 40 . For the brewing system 50 , sensors may include, a water temperature sensor, a water pressure sensor, a water pH sensor, an optical absorption sensor, an optical light scattering sensor, an optical polarization sensor to measure coffee extraction from the grind, a refractometer to measure coffee extraction, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors to measure other chemical parameters of brewing, and other chemical sensors. The use of such sensors integrated into a coffee making machine for monitoring and feedback control is novel. One of the key functions of the machine is the roasting of coffee beans in single serve portions with the green coffee beans provided in small pods. The roasting must happen quickly in order for the consumer to enjoy a cup of coffee within a few minutes. Traditional coffee bean roasting has been performed in large batches on industrial scale machines where roasting can take 10-20 minutes per batch, or in large industrial machines where the machine is continuously in operation and pre-heated to a high temperature such that roasting can be performed in a shorter time period. In both of these cases, these are large industrial machines that roast quantities from many pounds to thousands of pounds of green beans. The key difference here is that we need to rapidly roast a small quantity of green coffee beans (up to a 50 grams in weight) within a few minutes. This type of roasting machine is not currently made since we need very fast heat up time from the moment the user initiates the machine to make coffee. Roasting of coffee beans is typically done between 200C to 300C (and up to 500C in some cases). Thus the roaster (e.g., roasting system 30 shown in FIG, 10 ) must rapidly rise in temperature from ambient temperature of approximately 20C to several hundred degrees Celsius in a precisely controlled manner. Here we suggest ultrafast heater temperature increase ramp rate that can be in the range 1 to 10 C/second, 11 to 50 C/sec, 51 to 100 C/sec, 101 to 200 C/sec, or 201 C/sec and higher. Likewise at the end of roasting, the temperature must be rapidly cooled and thus the temperature decrease ramp rate can be in the range 1 to 10 C/second, 11 to 50 C/sec, 51 to 100 C/sec, 101 to 200 C/sec, etc. The overall time for roasting may be in the range of 1 to 30 seconds, 31 to 60 seconds, 61 to 90 seconds, 91 to 120 seconds, 121 to 300 seconds, etc. As described below, a rapid heating method is needed to roast the beans and this heat can be applied by convective, conductive, or radiation means. Thus the roasting portion of the entire machine is novel in that the quantity of beans and the speed of roasting is different from what is done currently. In order to roast beans quickly, we need a fast heating method that enables rapid temperature rise of the bean. Conventional ovens use electrical resistor heating elements that heat the air in the chamber, and this air then heats the sample in question through convective heating. A direct approach to heating is to use laser 12 (FIG. 1) heating. In laser heating of green coffee beans, a laser of specific wavelength, spot size, and power level is directed via an optical system to the green coffee beans 10 , which absorb the radiation and heat up. We have demonstrated that laser heating of green coffee beans can be used to rapidly roast green coffee beans. The use of a laser 12 allows direct heating of the bean 10 without heating up the air or other space around the bean 10 . Also, this approach allows very precise delivery of heat to the bean 10 since the heat source can be removed when the laser 12 is turned off or blocked. The laser 12 can be operated in continuous mode, pulsed mode or some sequential combination of these modes to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize bean 10 roasting (FIG. 2). This is a novel invention in that using lasers to rapidly roast green coffee beans has not been done before. The beans 10 may be agitated mechanically or with air to move them into the path of the laser beam. The laser beam delivery system may be mounted on a mechanical system 22 to move the beam across the array of coffee beans 10 that need to be roasted. Optical systems may be used to distribute the laser light uniformly upon the beans, or may be used to create a desired illumination profile across the coffee beans. The laser 12 used for illumination may be a diode laser, a diode laser single emitter, an array of diode laser single emitters, a diode laser bar, or diode laser stack of bars as desired. The laser diodes may operate in the visible wavelength range, the near infrared wavelength range, or other infrared wavelength range. The wavelength of operation may be chosen to correspond with specific spectral absorption features of the coffee bean 10 . A benefit of operating in the near infrared wavelength range is the commercial availability of high power laser diodes that have been developed for solid state laser pumping. The roasting may also be done using a combination of heating methods including laser radiation method along with convective resistive heating. In another embodiment of optical heating methods, a light emitting diode (LED) may be used instead of the laser light source with an appropriate optical system to direct the light from LED to the coffee beans. In another embodiment, microwave energy may be used to rapidly heat and roast the beans (e.g., a microwave oven). As shown in FIGS. 3-7, another approach to roasting green coffee beans is again to use radiation heating. In this case, we can use infrared or visible wavelength emission lamps 24 as the heating element. The green coffee beans absorb the radiated light from the bulb and heat up until roasted (the bulb may emit in the visible wavelength range, infrared wavelength range or some bands of wavelengths deemed desirable such as MIR, FIR, etc.). The use of a lamp 24 allows fast roasting and direct heating of the green coffee bean 10 within a transparent tube 11 and is a novel invention. The lamp 24 can be operated in continuous, pulsed, or some combination of these modes, to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize bean roasting. Lamps 24 emit light in multiple directions and some emitted light may not hit the beans. Thus to efficiently use the optical energy, it may be preferable to use optical cavity designs 26 to collect and direct the emitted light to the target coffee beans. Such optical cavity designs may include elliptical reflective cavities, multi-ellipse cavities, circular reflective cavities, etc. A number of cavity designs have been proposed in the lamp pumped laser industry that direct pump laser light to the absorbing laser rod. These cavity designs can be applied to roasting coffee whereby the laser rod is replaced with a glass tube containing coffee beans. Cross section diagrams of these geometries are shown in FIG. 3-7. It is a novel invention to use optical cavities 26 to capture and direct light to coffee beans for rapid roasting. The optical cavity 26 may also be designed to illuminate the beans 10 with a desired intensity profile for specific roasting as desired. The roasting may also be done using a combination of heating methods including lamp radiation method along with convective resistive heating. Though we have shown several cavity designs 26 , there are other cavity designs that may be used that capture and direct light to a focal spot while also homogenizing the focal spot light intensity. After roasting of coffee beans, it may be desirable to rapidly quench the beans 10 (i.e., rapidly cool down the beans) to stop the ongoing processes in the bean due to latent heat inside the bean. This may be done in one of several ways including water immersion quenching or forced air quenching. In particular, grinding the beans into small particles immediately after roasting increases surface area. Thus quickly grinding the beans and flowing air or water through the grinds quenches the bean from continuing to roast. In addition, the water used to brew the coffee serves also to quench the heat of the beans since the water used for brewing will be just under 100 Celsius in contrast to the several hundred degree Celsius roast temperature. During roasting of green coffee beans, the color of the beans changes from green to dark brown/black depending on the length of time roasted (a longer time gives a darker color). Traditionally, these roast types and colors are denoted coarsely as cinnamon/New England; city/full city; Vienna; espresso; Italian; French. In our approach to roasting, the use of quantitative measurements and methods such as precision imaging and signal processing will allow us to denote a much finer gradation in roast progress and thus much finer taste control. As the beans are roasted, some smoke may be emitted and chaff is released from the outside skin of the bean. The machine 16 may capture the smoke and may capture the chaff. During the roasting process the beans emit a defined popping sound at different times during roasting known as first crack and second crack. These sounds are indicative of roasting process and audio monitoring of this sound with feedback control may be used to optimize roasting. During roasting, the beans emit an aroma that is pleasant to many people and a desirable trait to smell. The machine may have features to capture and disperse this aroma outside of the machine into the local environment for the pleasure of the consumer. In another variation, the machine may capture the aroma scent into a small container or other device that can be opened later to release the aroma as desired by the user (or the aroma containment system could be attached to a coffee cup with aroma released in a time release manner). The machine 16 would be able to roast, grind, and brew, as mentioned above. Since the roasting process requires heat, it may be possible to recover extra waste heat from this process to heat or pre-heat the water needed for the brewing process. As one example, water may passed over the hot beans after roasting which serves to quench the beans and heat the water (but not limited to this method only). This is a novel approach to energy efficiency within the coffee machine and a new invention. Roasting of beans 10 may also be done on an individual basis to optimize taste. This is a novel concept that has never been done before in coffee making since roasting has traditionally been a large industrial process. The quantity of green beans needed for a single cup of coffee may range from 50 to 500 beans. For this discussion we use 100 beans to simplify the discussion, but the concepts apply to any number of beans. When using a radiative light based heating system (e.g., laser, LEDs, lamp, etc.), the beans may be aligned in a pattern with a corresponding pattern of illumination sources (this may be a 1:1 mapping, or N:M mapping of sources to beans). An optical system may be used between the sources and beans such that each bean is illuminated by one light source with the desired illumination pattern. Each light source may have individual power control or sub-arrays of the light source may have a single power control. By using a 1:1 mapping of light sources to beans, each bean may now be illuminated and heated with individual control. A camera may be used to image the color of the beans and along with image processing algorithms used to feedback individual power adjustment control to the individual light sources to optimize roasting (a wavelength selective filter may be placed in front of the camera to filter out the light used to roast the beans). This may mean roasting all beans to exactly the same degree of roast (e.g., color of roast) or it may mean creating a ‘roast blend’ where some beans are roasted to a different degree purposefully to get a desired taste profile in the final beverage (as an alternative, for the lamp based system, several separate cavities may be created with each cavity containing a subset of beans and each lamp can be controlled separately based on feedback sensors to optimize roast within that cavity). The beans from the several cavities are mixed before grinding. It may be possible to use an array of small resistive heating elements with each element in contact with one bean as an alternative to a light based heating system. In any of these cases, this is a completely novel invention to individually control roasting of coffee beans. The machine 16 would automate handling of the beans to move them from stage to stage of processing as needed. For example, moving between roasting and grinding, or moving between grinding and brewing. This may be considered as a robotic handling method that is new in a coffee machine. The machine 16 would have a receptacle for accepting the coffee pod 14 . The pod would be sealed but the machine 16 would have a method for automatically opening the pod 14 and dispensing the contents as needed to the first stage of processing. Grind Embodiments The machine 16 would have a grinding stage 40 where the roasted beans are ground into fine particles. The average particle size may vary between 50 microns to 2000 microns. The electrically powered grinder would be adjustable to a desired particle size. The grinder may be a blade grinder 29 , burr grinder 28 (e.g., a disc burr grinder, conical burr grinder, etc.), or any other grinder. A grinder that produces a uniform particle size is desirable. The time taken for grinding may be 1 to 10 seconds, 11 to 30 seconds, 31 to 60 seconds, 61 to 120 seconds, or 121 seconds and greater. After the roasting stage, the machine automatically moves the beans from the roasting stage to the proper location for grinding. After grinding, the machine automatically moves the beans to the proper location for brewing. The time taken to move between stages may be less than or equal to 1 second, 1.01 to 10 seconds, 10.01 to 45 seconds, etc. Brewing Embodiments After grinding, the ground particles are moved into the brewing stage 50 . Coffee brewing is performed by passing heated water through the grounds which extracts the coffee into the liquid. The machine would have a rapid water heating system 32 to quickly bring water to the proper temperature. The water temperature may be brought to boiling (212 F), or some other temperature range such as 150 to 160F, 161 to 175F, 176 to 195F, 196 to 211F, etc. A water temperature in the range of 195 to 205F is considered to be desirable for brewing coffee. The coffee grounds may be placed in a chamber with a filter at the bottom of the chamber and the filter may be paper or metallic. The coffee grounds may be tamped or compressed by the machine 16 as desired. The pressure of compression may be varied by the machine 16 as desired. The water may be injected into this chamber at high pressure. The water pressure may range from 0.1 bar to 18 bar depending on the coffee type (e.g., coffee, espresso, etc.) desired and the desired taste of coffee. A refractometer or other sensors may built into the coffee machine to provide real time measurement and feedback control of various brew parameters to optimize coffee taste. The time required to brew coffee would ideally be <1 minute. The amount of water used in making the cup of coffee may be any amount from 0.1 ounces to 20 ounces. The brewing time may be <1 second, 1.01 to 30 seconds, 30.01 to 60 seconds, or 60.01 seconds or longer. In an alternative brewing method, the water may be poured on top of the coffee grounds and mixed with the grounds. The coffee liquid may then be ‘sucked’ out of the chamber with a vacuum system 34 . The coffee grounds would remain in the chamber separate from the coffee liquid due to a filter that does not allow the coffee grounds to pass. The total time for making a cup of coffee with this machine from the time the user initiates operation may be <30 seconds (e.g. method 100 as shown in FIGS. 11), 30.01 to 60 seconds, 60.01 to 120 seconds, 120,01 to 180 seconds, 180.01 to 300 seconds (e.g., method 200 shown in FIG. 12), or 300.01 seconds or greater. As mentioned earlier, it is desirable that the coffee making machine make the cup of coffee as fast as possible while maintaining highest quality. The machine would dispense the coffee into a coffee cup. Additional Embodiments The machine 16 may have the capability to infuse 36 flavors and/or nutrients/vitamins into the final beverage. At stages after roasting, the machine may inject flavors (e.g., chocolate, hazelnut, etc.) or nutrients (e.g., vitamins, antioxidants, etc.) into the mixture such that this material is retained in subsequent steps and remains in the final beverage. The machine 16 may have an internet connection either through wired or wireless means. This internet connection would enable the features described above. In particular, the machine 16 would be able to interact with central servers to upload and download information about beans, optimized recipes for preparation, initiating coffee preparation from remote or local mobile devices, mobile apps, etc. One purpose of the many controls used in this machine 16 is to optimize the taste of the beverage for the final consumer to their specific desires. The taste sensors (taste buds) on each person's tongue are unique and different and cause individuals to respond differently to the same preparation. Thus, we envision the possibility of a method to determine the variation in taste sensors on a person's tongue and using that information to optimize the coffee making process to that individual. This effectively requires a sensor system that can map and ‘taste’ the corresponding taste sensors on the tongue, which can be done optically, spectroscopically, or through chemical sensors that map the tongue. This information could then be transmitted to the coffee machine 16 and algorithms optimize coffee preparation for that person's tongue. In another application of using lasers to assist in the coffee making process, the coffee beans could have small holes drilled through the bean using a laser. High pressure water could be injected through these holes to fracture the bean (e.g. bean fracking) into small particles and thus replace traditional grinding. Additionally it may be possible to inject hot water or steam into the small holes and use this to brew or extract the coffee from the bean in a new way (eg ‘in bean brewing’). The steam passes thru the beans and is condensed to form the beverage. Another way to make coffee using a coffee pod system is to perform all functions of roast, grind brew within the pod itself. The pod with green coffee beans may contain resistive heater elements that mate to current sources in the machine to roast coffee. Or the pod may be transparent to allow optical energy provided by the machine to impinge upon the beans and roast the beans. The machine may break the seal of the pod or puncture the pod as needed during these steps. Another approach to grinding is to apply sonic energy to the roasted beans to cause the beans to fracture into small particles; and/or high pressure water may be applied to the beans to cause them to fracture. Water may be injected into the pod in order to brew the coffee.","20190150658"

There are additional features of the disclosure that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. The objects of the disclosure, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the disclosure, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S) The disclosure will be better understood and objects other than those set forth above will become apparent when consideration is given to the following detailed description thereof. Such description makes reference to the annexed drawings wherein: FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an alcohol infused coffee pod assembly according to an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 2 is a front cut-away view of an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 3 is a detail view taken from circle 3 of FIG. 2 of an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a whole coffee bean of an embodiment of the disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 4 thereof, a new coffee pod device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 4, the alcohol infused coffee pod assembly 10 generally comprises a brewing cup 12 that has an outer wall 14 being tapered between a top end 16 and a bottom end 18 of the brewing cup 12 . In this way the brewing cup 12 is compatible with a single cup coffee brewing machine 20 , such as is manufactured by Keurig Dr. Pepper, 53 South Avenue, Burlington, Mass., 01803. The top end 16 is open and the bottom end 18 is closed. The brewing cup 12 is comprised of a fluid impermeable material to contain heated water from the single cup coffee brewing machine 20 . Additionally, the brewing cup 12 is comprised of a material that can be punctured. In this way the brewing cup 12 can be punctured by a dispensing spout of the single cup coffee brewing machine 20 . A plurality of coffee grounds 22 is included and the plurality of coffee grounds 22 is contained within the brewing cup 12 . In this way the coffee grounds 22 can be exposed to heated water for brewing coffee. The coffee grounds 22 may be ground coffee beans of any preferred species and flavor. An alcohol solution 24 is infused into the plurality of coffee grounds 22 thereby releasing alcohol in the heated water for brewing coffee. The alcohol solution 24 comprises ethanol thereby facilitating the alcohol to be safely consumed with the coffee. The alcohol solution 24 may include flavor additives, such as mocha, cream and other flavors associated with liqueurs that are commonly added to coffee. The alcohol solution 24 may be present in sufficient concentration to release approximately 0.3 ounces of alcohol, per 12.0 ounces of water, into the brewed coffee. In this way the alcohol content of the brewed coffee will be similar to adding a 1.5 ounce shot of liqueur to a traditionally brewed coffee. As is most clearly shown in FIG. 4, a whole coffee bean 25 , rather than coffee grounds 22 , may be infused with the alcohol solution 24 . A cover 26 is bonded to the top end 16 of the brewing cup 12 having the cover 26 completely covering the top end 16 . In this way the coffee grounds 22 are retained in the brewing cup 12 . The cover 26 is comprised of a fluid impermeable material to inhibit the alcohol solution 24 from evaporating during storage. Additionally, the cover 26 is comprised of a material that can be punctured to facilitate a water spout of the single cup coffee brewing machine 20 to puncture the cover 26 . The cover 26 has a lower surface 28 and the lower surface 28 is bonded to the top end 16 of the brewing cup 12 . In use, the brewing cup 12 is placed into the brewing basket of the single cup brewing machine 20 and the single cup brewing machine 20 is turned on the brew the coffee. The alcohol solution 24 is released into the hot water during the coffee brewing process. In this way a user can enjoy a cup of coffee with alcohol added. Additionally, the single cup brewing machine 20 will be operated with normal operating procedures. The brewing cup 12 is removed from the brewing basket and is disposed of when the coffee is brewed. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure. Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. In this patent document, the word “comprising” is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. A reference to an element by the indefinite article “a” does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be only one of the elements.","20210261324"

It concerns a coffee machine according to the preamble to claim 1 . A coffee machine of this type is known, for example, from the publication WO-A1-93/19655. STATE OF THE ART With automatic coffee preparation by means of coffee-making machines or coffee-vending machines, in which the coffee in bean form is first ground in a grinder housed in the machine, the ground coffee powder is then placed in a brewing chamber and compacted therein, pressurized hot water is then supplied through the brewing chamber and, finally, upon completion of the brewing process, the remaining filter cake is pushed out of the brewing chamber and ejected into a collecting container, it is desirable, in spite of the complex preparation steps to be performed, to arrange the machine in a manner such that it is of simple construction, operates for the longest possible periods of time without malfunction or maintenance, and is easy to clean and to maintain. In the publication cited in the introduction, a coffee machine is now proposed, the central element of which is a removable brewing unit ( 1 in FIGS. 1 - 3 ). A base and a plunger are arranged so as to be displaceable along a main axis in this brewing unit and perform different movement sequences that are coordinated with one another. These travels are designed in a manner such that ground coffee powder placed in a filling chamber is transported into an adjacent brewing chamber and is compressed therein between the base and the plunger. Pressurized hot water is then passed through the cylindrical compressed powder in a radial direction. The brewed coffee produced is outlet from the brewing chamber radially and discharged downwards. Upon completion of the brewing process, the remaining filter cake is pushed out of the brewing chamber in an axial direction and is ejected transversely relative to the main axis by means of an ejector. The different travels of the base, of the plunger, and of the ejector are brought about by a common drive unit by means of a special mechanism which includes, amongst other things, two parallel racks engaged by a pinion. For a detailed explanation of the operation, reference should be made to the publication cited. As can be seen from FIGS. 1 and 4 of the publication and from the description on page 4, last paragraph, the brewing unit is installed with its main axis, which corresponds to the direction of movement of the plunger, arranged transversely in the coffee machine, that is, the main axis extends parallel to the front of the machine. However, this arrangement has various disadvantages: owing to the displaceable arrangement of the base and of the plunger, as well as to the arrangement of the filling chamber, the brewing chamber, and the ejection region longitudinally relative to the main axis, the brewing unit reaches a relatively great length in the direction of the main axis, which length is effective as a width in the transverse installation described. Since, as well as the brewing unit, further functional units such as grinder, drive unit, water-heating unit, water reservoir, filter-cake collecting container, control electronics etc. are housed in the machine and must—at least partially—also be as accessible as possible from the front, the machine as a whole has a comparatively large width which is not always desirable. Basically, it would be possible to design the transversely installed brewing unit so that it could be pushed in from the side. However, in practice, this would mean that sufficient space would always have to remain clear beside the machine to permit unobstructed insertion or removal of the brewing unit. It is therefore usual to insert the transversely installed brewing unit directly transversely from the front and to remove it towards the front. However, the space in front of the brewing unit in the machine must consequently be kept free over the entire width of the brewing unit. A further problem arises in the coupling of the brewing unit, which has been removed and reinserted (for example, after cleaning), to the drive unit, which remains in the machine. In fact if, upon insertion, the movable elements (base, plunger, etc.) of the brewing unit adopt positions other than those adopted upon removal, the engagement point for the coupling is also displaced. An adjustment of the drive unit to the new engagement point, however, is difficult with the transverse installation of the brewing unit. Disadvantages owing to the transverse installation also arise with regard to the water supply: in order to limit, as far as possible, cooling of the brewed coffee on the path from the brewing chamber to the outlet, this path must be kept as short as possible. However, this means a radial flow through the brewing chamber which results in comparatively high flow resistances. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is therefore to provide an automatically operating coffee machine which has a compact brewing unit and which overcomes the disadvantages of known coffee machines and is characterized in particular by a simplified and space-saving design as well as easier accessibility for cleaning and maintenance purposes. The object is achieved by the features of claim 1 , taken as a whole. The essence of the invention is to design the brewing unit so that it can be pushed into the coffee machine from the front towards the rear with the main axis parallel to the direction of insertion. The brewing unit thereby requires only a small width of the machine both inside the machine and also during installation and removal. Moreover, this longitudinal insertion permits the arrangement under the brewing unit of suitable collecting containers which extend along the entire length of the brewing unit and thus offer protection against leakages in the brewing unit. A first preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that one or a plurality of guides, which extend parallel to the main axis of the brewing unit and are preferably bar-shaped, are provided for guiding the brewing unit during insertion in and removal from the coffee machine, and in that a catch is provided at the front end of the guide, for locking the inserted brewing unit. The guide facilitates the accurately positioned insertion of the brewing unit and thus ensures in a simple manner the mechanical and hydraulic connections between the brewing unit and the machine that are necessary for correct operation. A second preferred embodiment of the coffee machine according to the invention is characterized in that, in the brewing unit, the pressurized hot water is forced through the coffee powder disposed in the brewing chamber in the direction of the main axis, forwards from the rear and leaves through an outlet which is arranged at the front end of the brewing unit and is preferably adjustable in height, and in that the movable base and the plunger are equipped, on their surfaces facing the brewing chamber, with respective mesh plates through which the hot water enters the brewing chamber and the brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber, respectively. With the longitudinal configuration of the brewing unit according to the invention, with improved flow through the coffee powder, this enables advantageously short paths for the fluid to be achieved, which is of benefit to the quality of the brewed coffee. Another preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the movable base and the plunger are driven by means of an actuating slide which is arranged so as to be displaceable in the direction of the main axis in the brewing unit and which is releasably in engagement with a driving dog which is situated on a threaded rod arranged parallel to the main axis and which can be displaced along the main axis by rotation of the threaded rod, and in that releasable engagement between the driving dog and the actuating slide is brought about by a latching hook which extends in the direction of the main axis and is arranged so as to be pivotable on the driving dog about a pivot axis arranged transversely relative to the main axis. The engagement between the driven dog and the inserted brewing unit can be re-established easily and automatically thereby, even if the engagement position has changed in the meantime. Particularly simple control of the compacting of the coffee powder can be achieved if, in addition, the threaded rod is mounted so as to be displaceable in the direction of the main axis against the pressure of a spring element, preferably a spring assembly, and if the displacement of the threaded rod against the pressure of the spring element or spring assembly, for a predetermined travel as established by the striking of the driving dog, of the actuating slide, or of the plunger, against a resistance, is used for the control or switching of the drive. The change in density arising in the moistened coffee powder can be compensated for and an optimal brewing process can thereby be ensured if the plunger is moved by means of a plunger actuator displaceable in the direction of the main axis and if the plunger is operatively connected to the plunger actuator by means of compression springs acting in the direction of the main axis. Preferably, the pressurized hot water is supplied into the brewing chamber through the plunger and a valve mechanism is arranged on the plunger, the valve mechanism being closed when the plunger presses on the coffee powder disposed in the brewing chamber with a predetermined pressure and relieving the pressure of the pressurized water and allowing the water to escape to the exterior when the pressure of the plunger on the coffee powder is removed. In particular, this is brought about by virtue of the fact that the valve mechanism includes valve push-rods which are arranged on the plunger actuator and which, upon sufficient compression of the compression springs, sealingly enter corresponding valve bores in the plunger, which valve bores are in communication with a hot-water supply duct. Preferably, the hot-water supply duct can extend directly through one of the valve push-rods and the valve bores can be in communication with the brewing chamber through a mesh plate.

The coffee ground in the grinder 24 falls into a compact brewing unit 18 and is compacted therein in a brewing chamber ( 29 in FIGS. 3, 4 ). Pressurized hot water is then forced through the compressed powder. The resulting brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber through a spring-loaded creaming valve and is drawn off through an outlet 15 which projects forwards out of the coffee machine 10 and is preferably adjustable in height (pivotable), for example, into a cup which stands on a support surface 14 arranged beneath the outlet 15 . A steam/hot water nozzle 16 is arranged beside the outlet 15 for the foaming of milk (cappuccino) or for delivering hot water. The removable brewing unit 18 is covered at the front by a swivelling or removable cover 17 . An operating console 12 with the necessary operation and control elements is provided for the operation of the machine. A water container 13 that can be pulled out towards the front is arranged beneath the operating console 12 , for storing the water supply. A collecting container 48 for the filter cakes that are produced during the brewing process and are ejected from the brewing chamber is disposed on the left, beside the water container 13 , directly beneath the brewing unit 18 situated behind the cover 17 . The collecting container 48 can be pulled out towards the front by means of a gripping recess 49 . The collecting container 48 extends, together with an extension 50 formed on the rear region, beneath the brewing unit 18 along the entire length of the brewing unit 18 . If any leakages should occur in the brewing unit 18 , the collecting container 48 can thus also collect dripping water or coffee slops which can then easily be removed by pulling out the collecting container 48 together with the collected filter cakes. Permanent soiling of the coffee machine 10 can thus safely be prevented. The brewing unit 18 extends, according to FIGS. 3 and 4, along a main axis 48 . It includes, in addition to a filling chamber 30 and a brewing chamber 29 , a movable base 28 displaceable in the direction of the main axis 48 and a plunger 32 , also displaceable in the direction of the main axis 48 . As described in the publication cited in the introduction, the ground coffee powder falls out of the grinder 24 through a filling opening 31 into the filling chamber 30 . By a displacement of the plunger 32 towards the right (FIG. 3 ), the loaded coffee powder is pushed from the filling chamber 30 into the brewing chamber 29 where it is pressed against the movable base 28 and thereby compacted. Respective mesh plates 46 and 49 are secured on the end surfaces of the plunger 32 and of the movable base 28 (FIG. 4 ). Hot water is supplied into the brewing chamber 29 through the mesh plate 46 from the Left, in an axial direction, through the plunger 32 . The brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber 29 through the mesh plate 47 , axially towards the right, through the movable base 28 , and reaches the directly adjacent outlet 15 (FIG. 4 ). The brewing unit 18 is pushed into the coffee machine 10 in the longitudinal direction, that is, in the direction of the main axis 48 , from the front towards the rear (FIG. 2 ). For guiding the brewing unit 18 during insertion, use is made of one or a plurality of bar-shaped guide(s) 19 on the front end of which a (releasable) catch 20 for the brewing unit 18 is also arranged. The movable base 28 and the plunger 32 are moved, for example, by a rack mechanism as described by way of example in WO-A1-93/19655, of an actuating slide 27 arranged so as to be displaceable in the brewing unit 18 . The actuating slide 27 can be brought into engagement, by means of a releasable latching hook 26 , with a driving dog 25 which is situated on a rotatable threaded rod 21 which is driven by means of a drive wheel 22 of a drive motor, not shown. When the brewing unit 18 is pushed into the coffee machine 10 , the driving dog 25 moves towards the right, with the latching hook 26 , until the latching hook 26 has entered the actuating slide 27 and engaged therein. The engagement between the driving dog 25 and the actuating slide 27 can thus always safely be established, irrespective of exactly where the actuating slide 27 is disposed in the brewing unit 18 during insertion. The threaded rod 21 is arranged parallel to the guide 19 in the coffee machine 10 , is displaceable axially against the pressure of a spring assembly 23 composed of disc springs, and operates a microswitch (not shown) when the driving dog 25 strikes a resistance. In particular if, owing to compaction of the coffee powder, an opposing force builds up on the plunger 32 and thereby also on the driving dog 25 , the microswitch is operated when a predetermined value of that opposing force is exceeded. The compaction process can thus safely be controlled. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the plunger 32 is not coupled rigidly to the drive members but is connected, by means of two compression springs 42 , 43 , to a separate plunger actuator 33 which is driven by the actuating slide 27 . The compression springs 42 , 43 are situated with one end on two spring pins 40 , 41 (see also FIGS. 5 and 7) which are formed on the inner end surface of the plunger 32 . This spring coupling has a particular advantage: when the (dry) coffee powder is compacted, the drive switches off when a predetermined pressure is reached and the plunger actuator 33 and the plunger 32 come to a halt, in the course of which, owing to the prevailing pressure, the compression springs 42 , 43 are compressed to a predetermined extent. If the hot water is now forced through the brewing chamber 29 , owing to the moistening of the coffee powder, the density in the powder increases and the pressure in the powder decreases. The energy stored in the compression springs 42 , 43 then suffices to push the plunger 32 from behind and to compensate for the loss in volume so that the formation of undesired water channels past the coffee powder is safely prevented. The coupling described between the plunger 32 and the plunger actuator 33 by means of the compression springs 42 , 43 permits the simple construction of a valve mechanism which serves for the safe relief of the pressure from the pressurized water system upon completion of the brewing process. For this purpose, valve bores 44 , 45 with parallel axes are provided in the plunger 32 (FIGS. 3, 5 and 6 ); corresponding valve push-rods 36 , 37 arranged on the plunger actuator 33 (FIG. 3) enter the valve bores 44 , 45 sealingly when the compression springs 42 , 43 are sufficiently greatly compressed. Sealing takes place by means of O-rings (not shown) which are inserted in corresponding grooves 38 , 39 on the valve push-rods 36 , 37 . One of the valve push-rods, that is the valve push-rod 36 , also serves as an (axial) supply duct 34 for the hot water. Moreover, connection to the hot water system of the coffee machine 10 is established by means of a fluid-tight plug-type connection 35 which is operated upon the insertion of brewing unit 18 in the machine. If, upon completion of a brewing process, the plunger actuator 33 with the plunger 32 is withdrawn, the compression springs 42 , 43 are released and the valve push-rods 36 , 37 move out of the valve bores 44 , 45 so that residual pressurized hot water can come out of the supply duct 34 , with pressure relief, into the space between the plunger actuator 33 and the plunger 32 , from where it can be discharged to the exterior.

However, preparing coffee is time-consuming and can be an inefficient use of time and energy (including electrical energy) when only a single cup is to be prepared. Meanwhile, coffee makers that are designed to prepare a single cup of coffee using a single-serve ground coffee container (e.g. a Keurig® K-Cup® pod) produce an enormous amount of waste that is harmful to the environment. The result of single use K-Cup type pods is that the planet is literally being destroyed. Tens of billions of pods end up in landfills annually. If the discarded pods are placed end-to-end, they would circle the globe 12 times! This means that the waste problem is growing and will grow as more companies and unless mitigated will continue to cause problems exponentially for our planet. BRIEF SUMMARY The present disclosure contemplates various systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee. An amount of liquid coffee concentrate to prepare an individual serving of coffee is packaged in a sealed container. Unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods, the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate does not need to contain a filter since the process of preparing coffee from a liquid coffee concentrate involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds. Due to the absence of a filter and the concentrated nature of liquid coffee concentrate, the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate can be very small, for example, sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. A single sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate can be used to prepare a serving of coffee using an existing coffee maker (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker) designed for single-serve ground coffee containers (e.g. Keurig® K-Cup® pods). An adapter may be provided for receiving the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate and positioning the sealed container in the coffee maker. When the coffee maker is operated, an upper portion of the sealed container may be pierced by a needle of the coffee maker to allow heated water to flow into the sealed container. A lower portion of the sealed container may be pierced by a needle of the adapter or may be otherwise compromised to allow the combined liquid coffee concentrate and hot water to flow out of the sealed container and into a user's coffee cup. In accordance with one embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. The system includes a sealed container containing an amount of liquid coffee concentrate for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee and a coffee maker operable to prepare a single serving of coffee from the liquid coffee concentrate contained in the sealed container. The coffee maker includes a coffee maker recess for receiving the sealed container, a first coffee maker needle for piercing an entrance hole in an upper portion of the sealed container while the sealed container is in the coffee maker recess, a water conduit by which water from a water source flows into the sealed container through the entrance hole, and a heater for heating the water. The system may include an adapter for receiving the sealed container and positioning the sealed container in the coffee maker recess, the coffee maker recess receiving the sealed container while the sealed container is in the adapter. The adapter may include an adapter recess for receiving the sealed container, and an exterior sized to fit the coffee maker recess. The adapter may include an adapter needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed container when the sealed container is pressed into the adapter recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed container. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the exit hole. The sealed container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by the heater. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The coffee maker may include a second coffee maker needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed container when the sealed container is pressed into the coffee maker recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed container. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the exit hole. The sealed container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed container may be have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. In accordance with another embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate and a coffee maker having a coffee maker recess for receiving a single-serve ground coffee container. The system includes a sealed container containing an amount of liquid coffee concentrate for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, and an adapter for receiving the sealed container and positioning the sealed container in the coffee maker recess. The adapter includes an upper portion having an adapter recess for receiving the sealed container, and an exterior sized to fit the coffee maker recess. The adapter may include an adapter needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed container when the sealed container is pressed into the adapter recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed container. A combination of the liquid coffee concentrate and water from the coffee maker may flow out of the sealed container through the exit hole. The sealed container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by a heater of the coffee maker. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The sealed container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed container may have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. In accordance with another embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. The system includes a sealed container, and liquid coffee concentrate inside the sealed container in an amount for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee. The sealed container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by a heater of a coffee maker.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure encompasses various embodiments of systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. A person wishing to make a single serving of coffee takes a sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and places it in a coffee maker 50 . The sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 may be very small (e.g. sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate) in comparison to single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules. The coffee maker 50 may be a Keurig®, Nespresso® or other coffee maker that is designed to be used with single-serve ground coffee containers. The sealed container 10 may be placed inside an adapter 30 that positions the sealed container 10 in the coffee maker 50 . The person then closes the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 down on the sealed container 10 , causing a needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to puncture an upper portion of the sealed container 10 and allowing heated water to flow into the sealed container 10 through the puncture hole. A needle 38 of the adapter 30 may puncture a bottom portion of the sealed container 10 , or the sealed container 10 A may be designed to burst open in the bottom portion when filled with hot water, allowing the combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to flow down into the person's coffee cup. Afterward, the sealed container 10 , which is now punctured or otherwise compromised, may be thrown away or recycled, depending on its material composition. In either case, little waste is produced because the sealed container 10 needs no internal filter and may contain only the liquid coffee concentrate, making it much smaller than a single-serve ground coffee container such as a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or a Nespresso® capsule. FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 2 are a perspective view, a side view, and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of a sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and an adapter 30 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The sealed container 10 may contain an amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, e.g. 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The sealed container 10 may have a generally cylindrical body 12 as shown with a protruding cap 14 that extends laterally outward relative to the body 12 (e.g. by 2-10 mm). When the sealed container 10 is inserted into the adapter 30 , the body 12 may fit inside a recess 32 of the adapter 30 while the protruding cap 14 does not fit inside the recess 32 . In this way, the protruding cap 14 may prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 and may provide a convenient handhold for a person removing the sealed container 10 after it has been used. The sealed container 10 may be made of a recyclable or biodegradable material or combination of materials. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the sealed container 10 may include an exterior shell 16 made of a durable paper (e.g. lightweight cardboard) that is coated with an interior coating 18 such as a waterproof wax (e.g. paraffin wax), plastic (e.g. polyethylene), or parchment. For example, the body 12 and protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 may be cut, rolled, and/or folded from a sheet of the exterior shell 16 and interior coating 18 materials. The durable paper may be durable enough to allow the exterior shell 16 to maintain its form while being handled in the ordinary usage of the sealed container 10 . The body 12 and the protruding cap 14 may both include a portion of the exterior shell 16 and a portion of the interior coating 18 . The interior coating 18 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from degrading the exterior shell 16 , thus allowing the exterior shell 16 to be made from a durable paper such as cardboard. In some cases, the interior coating 18 may not be as recyclable or biodegradable as the exterior shell 16 and may instead melt off the exterior shell 16 and into the coffee as the coffee is prepared from hot water mixing with the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . In such cases, the interior coating 18 may be made of a material that is harmless when ingested and does not appreciably affect the taste of the coffee. As noted above, the sealed container 10 may contain, for example, 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The overall capacity of the sealed container 10 may be equal to the amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 contained in the sealed container 10 , or may be greater, with the remaining space filled with a quantity of air. The capacity of the sealed container 10 may range from the minimum capacity needed to contain the desired amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 (e.g. 5 mL, but may be lower depending on the concentration of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and the desired strength of the coffee) up to a maximum capacity depending on the size of the coffee maker that the sealed container 10 will be used with. For example, if the sealed container 10 will be inserted in an adapter 30 inside a Keurig® coffee maker, a relatively large sealed container 10 may have a capacity of around 40 mL. In the interest of minimizing the size of the sealed container 10 , the capacity of the sealed container 10 may be less than 20 mL, preferably less than 15 mL, more preferably less than 10 mL. Accounting for the material(s) of the sealed container 10 itself, the sealed container 10 may have an exterior volume that is slightly greater than its capacity, where the exterior volume is defined as the total volume of liquid displaced when the sealed container 10 is submerged in the liquid. Such exterior volume may similarly range between low values around 5 mL and relatively high values around 40 mL, with the exterior volume greater than the capacity of the sealed container 10 by an amount defined by the volume displaced by the material(s) of the sealed container 10 . For example, assuming the material(s) of the sealed container 10 displace 5 mL, the exterior volume of the sealed container 10 may be less than 25 mL, preferably less than 20 mL, more preferably less than 15 mL. The recess 32 of the adapter 30 may be generally cylindrical to match the shape of the sealed container 10 and may be wider (e.g. having a greater diameter) than the sealed container 10 , except that the recess 32 may be narrower (e.g. having a smaller diameter) than the protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 . In this way, the recess 32 may be shaped to prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the adapter 30 and becoming irretrievable. The exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped to fit inside an existing coffee maker in the same way that a single-serve ground coffee container fits inside the coffee maker. Thus, for example, the exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod, a Nespresso® capsule, etc., depending on which existing coffee maker the adapter 30 is designed for. It is also contemplated that the adapter 30 may be designed to universally match two or more such existing coffee makers (e.g. by matching a height dimension of one and a width dimension of another). In some cases, an existing coffee maker may have a needle positioned to pierce a lower portion of a single-serve ground coffee container. For example, a Keurig® coffee maker may have a part known as a K-Cup® holder that functions as a recess for receiving a K-Cup® pod, and the K-Cup® holder may have a part known as an exit needle that is positioned to pierce the bottom of the K-Cup® pod at a peripheral region of the K-Cup® pod. The adapter 30 may be shaped so as to avoid touching or pressing hard against such needle as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. In this regard, the adapter 30 may have a reduced height relative to the recess of the coffee maker, so as not to extend deeply enough into the recess to reach the needle, or the adapter 30 may have an exterior contour with a sloped or stepped region 34 in a lower portion thereof that slopes or steps inward to avoid the needle. Such reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 34 may symmetrically define the exterior of the adapter 30 or may occur only in a portion of the adapter 30 , e.g. as a dedicated slot to receive the needle. Meanwhile, the upper portion of the adapter 30 may have an outwardly extending lip 36 that extends laterally outward from the recess 32 in the upper portion of the adapter 30 . In this way, just as the protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 may prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the lip 36 of the adapter may prevent the adapter 30 from being inserted too far into the recess of the coffee maker. By holding the adapter 30 at the top of the recess of the coffee maker, the lip 36 may allow the adapter 30 to avoid the needle of the coffee maker. As shown in FIG. 2, the interior of the adapter 30 may include a hollow adapter needle 38 that acts as a fluid conduit between the recess 32 of the adapter 30 and the bottom of the adapter 30 . The adapter needle 38 may have a sharp point at the top and be positioned to puncture the bottom portion of the sealed container 10 when the sealed container 10 is pressed down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . The adapter 30 may be made of a hard plastic such as polypropylene and may be manufactured by injection molding, with the adapter needle 38 made of a metal alloy such as stainless steel or carbon steel. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the sealed container 10 and the adapter 30 with the sealed container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 . As shown in FIG. 3, the sealed container 10 may fit snugly in the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , with the recess 32 of the adapter 30 slightly larger than the sealed container 10 . In the case of a cylindrical sealed container 10 and a cylindrical recess 32 , the recess 32 may have an inner diameter that is slightly greater (e.g. 2-10 mm) than the exterior diameter of the sealed container 10 . When the sealed container 10 is placed inside the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the sealed container 10 may initially come to rest on top of the adapter needle 38 without being punctured. In this way, the sealed container 10 may be positioned in the adapter 30 (before or after the adapter is placed inside the coffee maker) without prematurely releasing the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from the sealed container 10 . FIGS. 4A and 4B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of the sealed container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 with the adapter 30 placed inside the coffee maker 50 , with FIG. 4A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 4B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. In FIG. 4A, the sealed container 10 is resting on top of the adapter needle 38 as in FIG. 3. Meanwhile, the entire adapter 30 is positioned inside a recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The illustrated recess 52 is a K-Cup® holder as used in Keurig® coffee makers, including an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) and a funnel part 56 . As can be seen, the adapter 30 is positioned in the recess 52 so as to avoid an exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . In the example of FIGS. 4A and 4B, the full height of the adapter 30 is great enough to extend down past the tip of the exit needle 55 while the lip 36 of the adapter 30 rests on the outside of the recess 52 . In this example, the adapter 30 can still avoid the exit needle 55 due to its exterior contour having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as shown. In addition to the recess 52 (having the exit needle part 54 and the funnel part 56 ), the coffee maker 50 shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B has a lid 58 (see FIG. 4B), a water conduit 60 , a pump 62 , and a heater 64 . The water conduit 60 provides water for making a cup of coffee. For example, water from a water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed container 10 as described in more detail below. The water source 61 may be, for example, a fillable water tank of the coffee maker 60 . The pump 62 may pump the water from the water source 61 to the sealed container 10 via the water conduit 60 , and the heater 64 may heat the water. For example, the heater 64 may heat the water while the water is at the water source 61 (e.g. in a water tank) or while the water is en route to the sealed container 10 (e.g. as the water flows through piping or tubing or one or more heating tanks of the water conduit 60 ). Thus, the heater 64 may heat only the amount of water needed for an individual cup of coffee or may heat a larger batch of water. The heater 64 may be an electric heater that heats the water by Joule heating. It is also contemplated that the water source 61 may be a connection to a cold water line of a building, similar to that used by a refrigerator that has a water dispenser or ice maker. In this case, the pump 62 may be omitted as the pressure in the water line is used to bring the water to the sealed container 10 via the water conduit 60 . The lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 has an entrance needle 66 for piercing a hole in an upper portion of the sealed container 10 while the sealed container 10 is in the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The entrance needle 66 may be hollow and act as a part of the water conduit 60 (e.g. with an upper end of the entrance needle 66 connected to tubing or piping of the water conduit 60 ). In this way, the water from the water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed container 10 through the tip of the entrance needle 66 after the entrance needle 66 punctures the hole in the sealed container 10 . To this end, the entrance needle 66 may have a sharp point at the bottom and be positioned to puncture the top portion of the sealed container 10 when the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed container 10 sitting into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . As the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed container 10 , a bottom face 68 of the lid 58 may abut against the sealed container 10 to press the sealed container 10 down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . In this way, the action of the lid 58 may, in addition to causing the entrance needle 66 to pierce the upper portion of the sealed container 10 , cause the sealed container 10 to press against the tip of the adapter needle 38 so that the adapter needle 38 punctures the lower portion of the sealed container 10 . The adapter needle 38 may have an internal passage 40 with an inlet 42 near the point of the adapter needle 38 where the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed container 10 and an outlet 44 at the bottom of the adapter 30 . When the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed container 10 , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 42 , through the internal passage 40 , and out of the outlet 44 and into the person's coffee cup where additional mixing of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may occur. Just below the inlet 42 , a gasket 46 may be provided to function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may be angled upward so as to function as a funnel that directs any fluid leaving through the puncture hole into the inlet 42 of the internal passage 40 of the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may also function as a seal against the sealed container 10 . For example, the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the height of the sealed container 10 below the protruding cap 14 matches the depth of the gasket 46 within the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . More specifically, the gasket 46 may be made of a flexible material (e.g. rubber) that is capable of bending downward as the sealed container 10 presses down on it, so as to remain in contact with the sealed container 10 for a range of depths (spanning 1-5 mm, for example). The sealed container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the bottom of the sealed container 10 falls within this range of depths when the protruding cap 14 rests on the adapter 30 outside the recess 32 . In this way, it may be assured that the bottom of the sealed container 10 presses against the gasket 46 , with the gasket 46 functioning as a seal between the adapter needle 38 and the sealed container 10 . The gasket 46 may thus prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 and gasket 46 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 5A and 5B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 a placed inside an adapter 30 a with the adapter 30 a placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 5A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 5B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 5A and 5B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 a and adapter 30 a . The sealed container 10 a may be the same as the sealed container 10 except that the exterior shell 16 a of the sealed container 10 a includes one or more holes 17 in a lower portion thereof, with the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 . The one or more holes 17 may be used to allow a mixture of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to burst out from the sealed container 10 when preparing a serving of coffee. To this end, the adapter 30 a may be the same as the adapter 30 except that the adapter 30 a omits the adapter needle 38 , including, in its place, a borehole 38 a extending from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a to the bottom of the adapter 30 a . The borehole 38 a may be present in the adapter 30 as well, with the only difference being the presence of the adapter needle 38 filling the borehole 38 a in the adapter 30 . As described above, water from the water source 61 may be pressurized by the pump 62 and heated by the heater 64 as it flows through the water conduit 60 . When the heated and pressurized water flows from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 a , the added heat and/or pressure of the water shooting into the sealed container 10 a and against the bottom of the sealed container 10 a may melt or otherwise degrade the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 , allowing the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow out of the sealed container 10 a through the one or more holes 17 . Along the same lines, instead of the one or more holes 17 , the exterior shell 16 a may have a kiss cut or other perforation or weakening in the lower portion thereof (preferably bottom exterior side), in the shape of a starburst for example. In this case, the pressure of the water shooting into the sealed container 10 a may blow out the exterior shell 16 a itself, rather than only the interior coating 18 . In either case, the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may then flow through the borehole 38 a of the adapter 30 a and down into the person's coffee cup. It should be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to burst through the interior coating 18 and/or exterior shell 16 a of the sealed container 10 a should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . In the case of the sealed container 10 a and adapter 30 a , there is no adapter needle 38 that punctures the bottom of the sealed container 10 a . Therefore, there is no danger of premature puncturing by the adapter needle 38 , and the sealed container 10 a may be completely inserted into the adapter 30 a at an initial stage as shown in FIG. 5A without needing to be pressed farther into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a by the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 . That is, the sealed container 10 a may always come to rest with the protruding cap 14 against the top of the adapter 30 a (preventing the sealed container 10 a from falling too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a ) as shown in FIG. 5A, never in an elevated position resting on the adapter needle 38 as in the case of the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 as shown in FIG. 4A. FIGS. 6A and 6B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 b placed inside an adapter 30 b with the adapter 30 b placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 6A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 6B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 6A and 6B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 b and adapter 30 b . The sealed container 10 b may be the same as the sealed container 10 except that, unlike the body 12 of the sealed container 10 , the body 12 b of the sealed container 10 b has a rounded bottom 13 b . In other respects, the body 12 b may be the same as the body 12 and may be, for example, generally cylindrical like the body 12 . The rounded bottom 13 b may advantageously act as a funnel within the sealed container 10 b , aiding the flow of all of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water contained in the sealed container 10 b to the same part of the sealed container 10 b for efficient flow out of the sealed container 10 b . For example, if the adapter needle 38 is positioned to puncture the center of the sealed container 10 b , the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed container 10 b to a point at the center of the sealed container 10 b where a hole is punctured by the adapter needle 38 . Similarly, in a case where there is no adapter needle 38 and the sealed container 10 b has holes 17 or other burst-through mechanism like the sealed container 10 a of FIGS. 5A and 5B, the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed container 10 b to the vicinity of the one or more holes 17 or other mechanism. The rounded bottom 13 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed container 10 b , e.g., as it may be produced from a single sheet of material. The rounded bottom 13 b may be half-spherical or exhibit any other curvature. The rounded bottom 13 b may include portions that are not curved, such as a central flat portion allowing the sealed container 10 b to be placed upright without falling over. The sealed container 10 b may also differ from the sealed container 10 in that the sealed container 10 b may have a protruding film 14 b in place of the protruding cap 14 . The protruding film 14 b may be made of an easily puncturable material such as aluminum foil or a laminate of aluminum foil and paper or plastic, which may cause the entrance needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to degrade less quickly as it is repeatedly used to pierce sealed containers 10 b . The protruding film 14 b may obviate the need for the interior coating 18 to extend beyond the body 12 b (e.g. to the protruding cap 14 described above), as the protruding film 14 b itself may be made of a material that is resistant to degradation caused by the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The protruding film 14 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed container 10 b , e.g. as the protruding film 14 b may be produced as a single sheet and without folded portions. The adapter 30 b may be the same as the adapter 30 or the adapter 30 a . The adapter 30 b shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B differs from the adapter 30 and 30 a to illustrate some modifications in design that may be applied to any of the adapters 30 , 30 a , 30 b . For example, the adapter 30 b has an annular depression 31 around the recess 32 in place of a sloping region of the adapters 30 and 30 a . The depression 31 is especially useful in the case of the sealed container 10 b because the protruding film 14 b may have much less height than the protruding cap 14 . Without the depression 31 , it might be difficult to retrieve the sealed container 10 b from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 b after use, since the protruding film 14 b might be almost flush against the top of the adapter 30 b . The depression 31 provides a place for a person's finger to go when grabbing the sealed container 10 b , making retrieval of the sealed container 10 b from the adapter 30 b easier. The adapter 30 b also illustrates an example in which the overall reduced height of the adapter 30 b relative to the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 , rather than the exterior contour of the adapter 30 b having a sloped or stepped region 34 , may be used to avoid the exit needle 55 of the coffee maker 50 . FIGS. 7A and 7B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 c placed inside an adapter 30 c with the adapter 30 c placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 7A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 7B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 7A and 7B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c . The sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be the same as the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 a except that, as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be shaped to take advantage of the existing exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 . As such, rather than having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the exterior contour of the adapter 30 c may remain wide enough in the vicinity of the exit needle 55 so as to allow the exit needle 55 to extend into a borehole 38 c of the adapter 30 c . In this regard, the borehole 38 c may be structurally the same as the borehole 38 a described in relation to FIGS. 5A and 5B, with the difference being its positioning in relation to the exit needle 55 . With the borehole 38 c positioned to correspond to the exit needle 55 , which is off-center, the recess 32 c may similarly be provided off-center in the adapter 30 c . More particularly, the recess 32 c may have a shape that is off-center toward the bottom while being centered in the adapter 30 c toward the top. As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, for example, the recess 32 c may have a generally upside-down L-shaped profile that diminishes in cross-sectional area from the top to the bottom of the adapter 30 c . By providing such an adapter 30 c , a correspondingly shaped sealed container 10 c may be placed in the recess 32 c such that the top of the sealed container 10 c may be punctured by a central entrance needle 66 and the bottom of the sealed container 10 c may be punctured by an off-center exit needle 55 . In this way, both the needles 66 , 55 of the existing coffee maker 50 may be used and the adapter needle 38 is not required. Heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 c through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed container 10 c through the exit needle 55 and down into the person's coffee cup. More specifically, the exit needle 55 may have an internal passage 70 with an inlet 72 near the point of the exit needle 55 where the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed container 10 c and an outlet 74 that feeds into the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 . When the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed container 10 c , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 72 , through the internal passage 70 , and out of the outlet 74 . Just below the inlet 72 , a gasket 76 may be provided to function as a seal around the exit needle 55 in the same way that the gasket 46 may function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 8A and 8B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 d including cross-sectional views of the sealed container 10 of FIGS. 1-4B placed inside the coffee maker 50 d without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 8A showing the coffee maker 50 d in an open position and FIG. 8B showing the coffee maker 50 d in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 d may differ from the coffee maker 50 described above in that the coffee maker 50 d may be specifically designed for use with the sealed container 10 , i.e. with no adapter 30 necessary. In this regard, the coffee maker 50 d may be the same as the coffee maker 50 in all respects except for the recess 52 . Whereas the recess 52 includes an exit needle part 54 with an off-center exit needle 55 , the recess 52 d of FIGS. 8A and 8B includes an exit needle part 54 d with an exit needle 55 d that is located in the center. The recess 52 d may further include a funnel part 56 d that is the same as the funnel part 56 except that it is designed to align with the centered exit needle 55 d of the exit needle part 54 d rather than the off-center exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . The recess 52 d may further differ from the recess 52 in that it may have a generally smaller interior than the recess 52 of an existing coffee maker 50 (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker). This is because, as described above, the sealed container 10 may be significantly smaller than a single-serve ground coffee container like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod. In use, heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed container 10 through the exit needle 55 d and down into the person's coffee cup. Alternatively, the coffee maker 50 d may omit the exit needle 55 d , having only a borehole similar to the borehole 38 a but extending downward from the recess 52 d of the coffee maker 55 d rather than from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a . Such a modified coffee maker 55 d could be used with the sealed container 10 a having the one or more holes 17 . The combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may burst from the sealed container 10 as the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 melts (or as the sealed container 10 itself bursts open as described above), thereafter flowing down through the borehole 38 a and into the person's coffee cup. In the example of the dedicated coffee maker 50 d of FIGS. 8A and 8B, a funnel part 56 d is included, corresponding to the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B. The funnel part 56 of FIGS. 4A-7B is a feature some existing coffee makers (e.g. Keurig® coffee makers) and therefore is depicted in FIGS. 4A-7B, which may represent embodiments in the context of existing coffee makers. On the other hand, the coffee maker 50 d shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B represents a coffee maker 50 d that is designed for use with the sealed containers 10 , 10 a , etc. of the present disclosure. Thus, the funnel part 56 d can be omitted. FIGS. 9A and 9B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B, including cross-sectional views of a container 10 e placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 9A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 9B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The container 10 e may be a reusable container rather than a disposable container and may differ from the container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above in several respects. First, the container 10 e may have an open or openable top 78 in place of a sealing cap 14 or film 14 b . As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, for example, the top 78 of the container 10 e may contain a central opening 80 , but it is also contemplated that the top 78 may be openable, e.g. by a hinge. Second, the container 10 e may have a pressure relief valve 82 at the bottom. The pressure relief valve 82 , illustrated schematically in FIGS. 9A and 9B, may be of any known construction that is capable of opening in response to a buildup of pressure in the container 10 e or in the bottom region thereof. In a simple construction, the pressure relief valve 82 may be a flap or door that is biased in a closed position to seal against the container 10 e and opens downward when pushed from above. Third, the overall size and shape of the container 10 e may be somewhat larger than that of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above and may, for example, be shaped and sized similarly to a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or other single-serve ground coffee container and designed to fit directly in an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 similar to how the adapter 30 fits in the exit needle part 54 in FIGS. 4A and 4B. For example, an outwardly extending lip 84 of the container 10 e may function just like the lip 36 to allow the container 10 e to rest on the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 without falling in or touching the needle 55 . Since the container 10 e may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the container 10 e , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the container 10 e through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then place the container 10 e inside the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9A and lower the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9B. Heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the container 10 e through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the container 10 e through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. In this regard, the valve 82 may be configured to remain closed under the pressure of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 (i.e. after dispensing liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the reusable container 10 D) and to open under the pressure of the flow of water from the water conduit 60 . It should also be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to open the pressure relief valve 82 should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . When the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 10 e , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 10 e as the water flows through the reusable container 10 e . Thus, one may immediately reuse the container 10 e. FIGS. 10A and 10B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B, 9A, and 9B, including cross-sectional views of another container 10 f placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 10A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 10B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The container 10 f may be the same as the container 10 e and may similarly be reusable, except that the container 10 f may be shaped and sized similarly to an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . Thus, in a case where the coffee maker 50 is a Keurig® coffee maker, an example of the shape and size of the container 10 f is the My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter by Keurig®. Like the container 10 e , since the container 10 f may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the container 10 f , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the container 10 f through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then replace the exit needle part 54 and funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 with the container 10 f as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B (e.g. in the case of a Kuerig® coffee maker 50 , the Keurig® portion pack holder may be pushed up from below and removed, and the container 10 f may be placed in the resulting recess just like a My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter). With the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 lowered as shown in FIG. 10B, heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the container 10 f through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the container 10 f through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. As in the case of the container 10 e , when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 10 f , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 10 f as the water flows through the reusable container 10 f. In the above examples, water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 (and combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 ) are described as flowing through hollow needles 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . However, it is also contemplated that the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may instead only pierce the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. without additionally functioning as a conduit for the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 . For example, the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may retract subsequent to puncturing the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. or be structured to allow the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow adjacent to or around the outside of the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . In the above examples, the top and bottom of the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 enters or exits the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. through the top or bottom of the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. Other points of entry or exit are also contemplated, such as the side. In the above examples, generally cylindrical shapes are depicted for the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. However, other shapes are contemplated as well, such as balls, boxes, etc., and it is contemplated that adapters 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to accommodate such shapes. It is similarly envisioned that the exterior of the adapter 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to fit inside any single-serve coffee maker, e.g. coffee makers by Keurig®, Nespresso®, Mr. Coffee®, Cuisinart®, Presto® MyJo™, Bunn®, etc., and may be designed to fit universally inside more than one coffee maker.

BACKGROUND ART In general, a coffee bean grinder includes a hopper into which coffee beans are put, a grinding part that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper, and a discharge part that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part (for example, PTL 1). Moreover, among such coffee bean grinders, there is a coffee bean grinder that can adjust the grinding grade of coffee beans. With the coffee bean grinder, an adjustment dial is rotated to adjust the clearance between a grinder disc that is provided in the grinding part and that has radial protrusions and depressions and a prebreaker that is provided to face the grinder disc, and hence the grinding grade of coffee beans can be adjusted. The coffee beans thus ground are transferred to a paper filter or a portafilter, and then coffee or espresso can be extracted using a coffee extractor or an espresso machine. CITATION LIST Patent Literature PTL 1: Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Registration Application Publication No. 05-005032 SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem When the coffee beans thus ground are transferred to the paper filter or the portafilter, the following problems have been hitherto pointed out. That is, when the coffee beans thus ground are transferred to the paper filter or the portafilter, if a certain distance exists between the discharge part and the filter, the coffee beans may be scattered to the outside therefrom. To prevent this trouble, PTL 1 suggests a coffee bean grinder in which the discharge part is coupled with the filter to prevent coffee beans from being scattered to the outside. However, coffee beans for espresso are extra finely ground and have no fluidity. The extra finely ground beans may be clogged in a communication path in the middle, and in addition, it is difficult to uniformly put the coffee beams into the portafilter. Owing to this, the coffee beans have to be measured with a dedicated cup and transferred to the portafilter, and the coffee beans may be scattered to the outside at this time. In light of the problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a coffee bean grinder that can transfer ground coffee beans to a portafilter so as not to scatter the ground coffee beans to the outside and so as to obtain uniform workability without a gap. Solution to Problem That is, to solve the above-described problems, the present invention provides a coffee bean grinder including a hopper into which coffee beans are put; a grinding part that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper; and a discharge part that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part. In the coffee bean grinder, an attachment part to which a portafilter is attached so as to come into close contact with a lower end portion of the discharge part is provided. With this configuration, when coffee beans for espresso are extra finely ground, the coffee beans can be directly put into the portafilter. The coffee beans do not have to be transferred using a dedicated cup or the like, the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside, and the coffee beans are uniformly put. Accordingly, subsequent work can be markedly reduced. In addition, the attachment part has a recess portion to which a protruding piece provided at an outer periphery of the portafilter is fitted. With this configuration, the portafilter can be directly attached to the lower end portion of the discharge part. Accordingly, the portafilter does not require an additional new attachment when the portafilter is attached, and the portafilter can be attached at low cost. Furthermore, an upper surface portion of a filter basket for putting the coffee beans into the portafilter is aligned with the lower end portion of the discharge part or a lower surface portion of a close contact member provided continuously from the lower end portion. With this configuration, the portafilter comes into close contact, and hence the coffee beans can be put into the portafilter without a gap. The discharge part has a tapered portion in which an inner wall is widened downward. With this configuration, extra finely ground coffee beans can be dropped while being dispersed, the coffee beans do not adhere to an inner wall surface, and clogging in the discharge part does not occur. In addition, a hole portion for releasing inside air to outside is provided at the tapered portion. With this configuration, even when a space with respect to the tapered portion is closed with the portafilter, the air in the space can move from the inside to the outside. The coffee beans are dropped to the portafilter while being spread, and the coffee beans can be put into the portafilter without a gap. Advantageous Effects of Invention With the present invention, in the coffee bean grinder including the hopper into which the coffee beans are put, the grinding part that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper, and the discharge part that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part, the attachment part to which the portafilter is attached so as to come into close contact with the lower end portion of the discharge part is provided. Accordingly, when extra finely ground coffee beans are directly put into the portafilter, it is not required to transfer the coffee beans using a dedicated cup or the like, the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside, and the coffee beans can be uniformly put into the portafilter. Thus, subsequent work can be markedly reduced. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 illustrates an external appearance of a coffee bean grinder according to an embodiment of the present invention.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to the drawings. A coffee bean grinder 1 according to this embodiment can grind coffee beans with various grinding grades. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the coffee bean grinder 1 includes a hopper 2 into which coffee beans can be put, a grinding part 3 that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper 2 , and a discharge part 4 that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part 3 . As illustrated in FIG. 3, the coffee bean grinder 1 includes, as a feature, an attachment part 5 to which a portafilter 6 for espresso is attached, at a lower end portion of the discharge part 4 , to allow the coffee beans discharged from the discharge part 4 to be put directly into the portafilter 6 . The coffee bean grinder 1 according to this embodiment is described below in detail. First, the hopper 2 provided at the coffee bean grinder 1 has an inverted conic shape. Roasted coffee beans can be put into the hopper 2 . The hopper 2 is formed of a transparent plastic resin or the like such that the amount of coffee beans can be visually recognized. The hopper 2 drops the coffee beans from an opening portion 21 provided at a lower end side of the hopper 2 toward the grinding part 3 . The grinding part 3 can grind the coffee beans dropped from the hopper 2 . In this case, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the grinding part 3 includes a grinder disc 32 and a prebreaker 31 . The grinder disc 32 has obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a provided on a surface of the grinder disc 32 . The prebreaker 31 can rotate in a state in which the clearance width between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 is adjusted. An adjustment mechanism that adjusts the clearance width between the grinder disc 32 and the prebreaker 31 is described. First, a shaft 33 of a motor 33 a that rotates the prebreaker 31 is provided to protrude from the center of the grinder disc 32 , is joined to the prebreaker 31 at a tip end portion of the shaft 33 , and rotates the prebreaker 31 . A bearing portion 31 a of the prebreaker 31 is rotatably fitted on the shaft 33 of the motor, and applies a force to the prebreaker 31 in a direction away from the grinder disc 32 via a spring 31 b that is provided on the outside of the bearing portion 31 a . In addition, slits 31 s and 33 s are respectively formed in the tip end portion of the shaft 33 of the motor 33 a and a center portion of the prebreaker 31 . A shear plate 34 is inserted into the slits 31 s and 33 s to transmit the rotational force of the shaft 33 to the prebreaker 31 . A circular protruding portion 31 c is formed at the center portion of the prebreaker 31 . A pressing portion 35 a that is provided at a shaft on a back surface side of an adjustment dial 35 is pressed to the circular protruding portion 31 c to move the prebreaker 31 toward the grinder disc 32 . When the grinding grade of coffee beans is adjusted by using the adjustment mechanism thus configured, the adjustment dial 35 is rotated, and the pressing portion 35 a provided at the center of the adjustment dial 35 is pressed toward the protruding portion 31 c of the prebreaker 31 . Then, the prebreaker 31 moves toward the grinder disc 32 against the force of the spring 31 b , and decreases the clearance width with respect to the grinder disc 32 . By rotating the motor 33 a , the prebreaker 31 is rotated via the shear plate 34 provided at the tip end of the shaft 33 . When the prebreaker 31 is rotated in this way, the coffee beans in the clearance with respect to the grinder disc 32 are finely ground by the obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a of the grinder disc 32 , and are discharged to the lower discharge part 4 . The discharge part 4 discharges the coffee beans discharged from the grinding part 3 downward. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the discharge part 4 includes a communication path 41 that communicates with a lower end portion of the grinding part 3 , and a tapered portion 42 that is provided to cover a lower outer peripheral portion of the communication path 41 . The communication path 41 is provided to extend from the lower side of the grinding part 3 along the vertical direction. With the communication path 41 , the extra finely ground coffee beans are dropped straight. If the communication path 41 is inclined, the coffee beans extra finely ground for espresso may adhere to a wall surface of the communication path 41 and cannot be discharged straight. In addition, if the coffee beans cannot be discharged, more coffee beans are required, and when coffee beans are ground with another grinding grade, the ground coffee beans are mixed with the previous coffee beans remaining in the communication path 41 . The mixture of the coffee beans changes the flavor. Owing to this, in this case, the coffee beans discharged from the lower side of the grinding part 3 are dropped straight vertically downward, and thus prevent the coffee beans from remaining in the communication path 41 . The tapered portion 42 is configured to disperse the coffee beans dropped from the communication path 41 , and has a tapered shape whose inside diameter increases downward. Since the tapered portion 42 has the tapered shape, the coffee beans can be prevented from adhering to the wall surface, and the coffee beans can be uniformly dropped into the portafilter 6 attached to the lower side of the tapered portion 42 . With this configuration, as a feature, the attachment part 5 for attaching the portafilter 6 and a paper bag 7 is provided at a lower end portion 43 of the tapered portion 42 . As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the attachment part 5 has a recess portion 51 and a groove portion 52 for attaching the portafilter 6 , at the outer periphery of the lower end portion 43 of the tapered portion 42 , and a bag holder 45 for attaching the paper bag 7 . As illustrated in FIG. 5, the portafilter 6 attached to the attachment part 5 has a recess portion at a tip end of a handle 61 . A filter basket 63 can be removably fitted to the recess portion. The filter basket 63 is configured to put coffee beans therein. Espresso is dripped from numerous pores 64 provided in a bottom surface of the filter basket 63 . The dripped espresso is ejected from a hole portion 65 (see FIG. 3 etc.) provided at the center of the portafilter 6 , and then is poured in a container such as a cup. A pair of left and right protruding pieces 66 are formed at an outer peripheral portion 62 of the portafilter 6 along the outer circumferential direction. The portafilter 6 can be used by attaching the protruding pieces 66 to an espresso machine or the like. The attachment part 5 to which such a portafilter 6 is attached can be attached so as to hermetically seal the inner space of the tapered portion 42 by using the protruding pieces 66 of the portafilter 6 . More specifically, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the attachment part 5 includes a fit member 50 a to which the portafilter 6 is fitted, and a close contact member 50 b with which an upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 of the portafilter 6 is brought into close contact when the portafilter 6 is attached to the fit member 50 a . The fit member 50 a has the recess portion 51 into which the protruding pieces 66 of the portafilter 6 can be inserted from below, and the groove portion 52 formed from the recess portion 51 along the circumferential direction. The portafilter 6 is attached by inserting the protruding pieces 66 into the recess portion 51 and rotating the protruding pieces 66 . The groove portion 52 is formed in a helical shape so that the protruding pieces 66 rise when the portafilter 6 is attached while being rotated. Thus, the portafilter 6 is pushed upward. Moreover, the close contact member 50 b is attached to a screw thread formed on an outer peripheral portion at a lower end of the tapered portion 42 . A sag portion 501 continuously sags from an inner wall surface of the tapered portion 42 . The filter basket 63 comes into close contact with the sag portion 501 . To prevent coffee beans from getting into a gap between the filter basket 63 and the sag portion 501 when the filter basket 63 is brought into close contact with the sag portion 501 , an inclined portion 502 that is curved along an inner wall surface of the filter basket 63 is provided. Thus, coffee beans dropped from above do not get into the gap with respect to an upper surface of the filter basket 63 . In addition, when the lower side of the tapered portion 42 is covered with the portafilter 6 , the inner space of the tapered portion 42 is hermetically sealed, and the inside may be pressurized as coffee beans are dropped. Then, the coffee beans may be hardly dropped from the communication path 41 , and may be clogged in the communication path 41 . Thus, in this case, a hole portion 44 is provided for releasing the air in the inner space of the tapered portion 42 to the outside. The hole portion 44 is provided to have a diameter that is smaller than the diameters of extra finely ground coffee beans and that allows the air to be released to the outside. Moreover, when such a hole portion 44 is provided, if the coffee beans adhere to the hole portion 44 , the hole portion 44 cannot release the air. Owing to this, the hole portion 44 is provided at a position that is in an upper portion of the tapered portion 42 and that is outside the communication path 41 . Since the hole portion 44 is provided at such a position, the hole portion 44 is not closed with the coffee beans, the air flows downward to a bottom portion of the filter basket 63 , spreads outward, and flows upward again. Thus, the coffee beans can be uniformly spread and put into the filter basket 63 . As illustrated in FIG. 7, the paper bag 7 is for a take-out of ground coffee beans, and can house coffee beans from an upper opening portion. The bag holder 45 to which the paper bag 7 is attached is provided with a lever 45 a that attaches the paper bag 7 to an outer peripheral portion of the communication path 41 so as to cover the discharge part 4 , and a spring (not illustrated) that presses a lower end portion of the lever 45 a toward the communication path 41 . The paper bag 7 is set to cover the discharge part 4 , and in this state, an area around the opening portion is pressed and fixed with the lever 45 a . Since the lever 45 a is provided at the outer peripheral portion of the communication path 41 in this way, the paper bag 7 can be pressed and fixed. In addition, when the portafilter 6 is attached and coffee beans are put into the portafilter 6 , a small amount of coffee beans remaining in the communication path 41 and the tapered portion 42 are dropped into the portafilter 6 by several times of knocking with the lever 45 a. A method of using the coffee bean grinder 1 thus configured is described next. First, when coffee beans for espresso are to be ground, roasted coffee beans are put into the hopper 2 . At this time, an amount of coffee beans that can exactly fill the portafilter 6 is put into the hopper 2 . At the time of putting the coffee beans into the hopper 2 , the portafilter 6 is attached to the lower end side of the discharge part 4 . When the portafilter 6 is to be attached, the protruding pieces 66 provided at the outer periphery thereof are fitted to the recess portion 51 , the handle 61 is turned in this state, and hence the protruding pieces 66 are held by the groove portion 52 . Then, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the inclined portion 502 that is a lower surface portion of the close contact member 50 b comes into close contact with the upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 . Then, in the state in which the portafilter 6 is attached, the adjustment dial 35 is rotated and set to extra fine grinding. Then, the pressing portion 35 a provided at the center of the adjustment dial 35 protrudes and presses the protruding portion 31 c of the prebreaker 31 . Thus, the prebreaker 31 moves toward the grinder disc 32 . The power is turned ON in this state to rotate the motor 33 a . Then, the coffee beans dropped from the opening portion 21 of the hopper 2 get into the area between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 , and the coffee beans are extra finely ground with the obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a of the grinder disc 32 . The ground coffee beans are dropped in the vertical direction from the lower side of the grinding part 3 via the communication path 41 , and are dropped into the filter basket 63 in a state in which the coffee beans are dispersed by the tapered portion 42 . At this time, since the upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 and the inclined portion 502 of the close contact member 50 b are in close contact with each other, the coffee beans can be put without a gap at the wall surface of the filter basket 63 . When the coffee beans thus extra finely ground in this way are dropped from the tapered portion 42 , the air cannot be released from the inner space of the tapered portion 42 that is hermetically closed with the portafilter 6 , and the inner space is pressurized. However, since the hole portion 44 is provided at the tapered portion 42 according to this embodiment, the air can be released from the hole portion 44 to the outside as the coffee beans are dropped as illustrated in FIG. 6. Thus, the coffee beans can be successively dropped. After the coffee beans have been put into the portafilter 6 in this way, the lever 45 a is knocked to drop the coffee beans adhering to the communication path 41 and so forth, and then the handle 61 of the portafilter 6 is rotated in the opposite direction to detach the protruding pieces 66 from the attachment part 5 . Then, mountain-shaped coffee beans are flattened and pressed, the portafilter 6 is attached to an espresso machine, and espresso is extracted. When coffee beans for coarse grinding are to be ground, as illustrated in FIG. 7, coffee beans are put into the hopper 2 and the paper bag 7 is attached. When the paper bag 7 is attached, the paper bag 7 is set to cover the discharge part 4 , and the area around the opening portion thereof is pressed and fixed with the lever 45 a. In the state in which the paper bag 7 is attached, the adjustment dial 35 is rotated and set to coarse grinding. Then, the pressing portion 35 a provided at the center of the adjustment dial 35 is retracted to the inside, the prebreaker 31 moves away from the grinder disc 32 , and the clearance between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 increases. When the power is turned ON and the motor 33 a is rotated in this state, the coffee beans dropped from the opening portion 21 of the hopper 2 get into the area between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 , and the coffee beans are coarsely ground with the obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a of the grinder disc 32 . The ground coffee beans are dropped in the vertical direction from the lower side of the grinding part 3 via the communication path 41 and the tapered portion 42 , and dropped into the paper bag 7 . After the coffee beans have been put into the paper bag 7 in this way, the lever 45 a is tilted on the opposite side, the paper bag 7 is removed, and the opening portion is welded, to put the coffee beans in the paper bag 7 up for sale as take-out coffee beans. With the above-described embodiment, in the coffee bean grinder 1 including the hopper 2 into which the coffee beans are put, the grinding part 3 that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper 2 , and the discharge part 4 that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part 3 , the attachment part 5 to which the portafilter 6 is attached so as to come into close contact with the lower end portion of the discharge part 4 is provided. Accordingly, extra finely ground coffee beans can be directly put into the portafilter 6 , it is not required to transfer the coffee beans using a dedicated cup or the like, and the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside. In addition, the attachment part 5 has the recess portion 51 to which the protruding pieces 66 provided at the outer periphery of the portafilter 6 are fitted. Accordingly, the portafilter 6 does not require an additional new attachment when the portafilter 6 is attached, and the portafilter 6 can be attached at low cost. Furthermore, the upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 for putting the coffee beans into the portafilter 6 comes into close contact with the inclined portion 502 that is the lower surface portion of the close contact member 50 b . Accordingly, the coffee beans can be put into the portafilter 6 without a gap. The discharge part 4 has the tapered portion 42 in which the inner wall is widened downward. Accordingly, extra finely ground coffee beans do not adhere to the inner wall surface of the discharge part 4 , and clogging or the like in the discharge part 4 can be prevented from occurring. The hole portion 44 for releasing the inside air to the outside is provided at the tapered portion 42 . Accordingly, even when the space with respect to the tapered portion 42 is hermetically sealed with the portafilter 6 , the air in the space can be released from the hole portion 44 , and the coffee beans can be dropped and put into the portafilter 6 while the inside air is released. The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and can be implemented in various forms. For example, while coffee beans are ground at various grinding grades in the above-described embodiment, the invention can be applied to a coffee bean grinder dedicated to extra fine grinding for espresso. Moreover, while the coffee beans are ground using the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 in the above-described embodiment, the coffee beans may be ground by any of other methods. Furthermore, while the small hole portion 44 is provided at the tapered portion 42 in the above-described embodiment, it is not limited thereto. A large cylindrical hole may be provided at the tapered portion 42 and the inside air may be released. In this case, the inside diameter of the hole portion 44 may be a desirable diameter as long as the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside. While the close contact member 50 b is in close contact with the filter basket 63 in the above-described embodiment, the gap may be closed by bringing the lower surface of the tapered portion 42 into close contact with the upper surface of the filter basket 63 . In this case, the inner wall surface of the tapered portion 42 is aligned with the inner wall surface of the filter basket 63 , so that the coffee beans are not put on the upper surface of the filter basket 63 . While the inclined portion 502 is provided at the lower surface side of the close contact member 50 b in the above-described embodiment, the inclined portion 502 may have a shape that is inclined at a constant angle in addition to the surface having a curvature.

No. 62/977,765, filed Feb. 18, 2020, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND 1. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to coffee brewing and, more specifically, a method of producing a flash brewed coffee concentrate. 2. DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART Cold brew coffee is gaining popularity amongst consumers for its unique flavor profile in a cold coffee beverage. Unfortunately, the process to prepare cold brew coffee in a manner in which a full range of flavors result can be a time consuming, and labor intensive process is required. Some cold brew coffee processes can take between six and twenty-four hours. One method of brewing coffee that is gaining popularity is a method of brewing known as “Japanese Pour Over.” In Japanese Pour Over, coffee is brewed with hot water, and then poured directly onto ice. The Japanese Pour Over brewing method allows for a quick extraction of flavor from coffee grounds and followed by rapid cooling to lock in the flavors and volatile aromatics. The Japanese Pour Over brewing method forms cold coffee with a full range of flavors that takes less time to brew than traditional cold brew methods. While the Japanese Pour Over brewing method may be suitable for gourmet coffee shops or in the home, it is not suitable for producing coffee on a commercial scale. For example, the Japanese Pour Over brewing method produces a ready-to-drink coffee that cannot be packed, stored, and transported for commercial use that requires an extended shelf-life. SUMMARY This disclosure relates generally to a method of forming a flash brewed coffee concentrate that produces a coffee extract having aromas and flavors similar to the Japanese Pour Over brewing method. The flash brewed coffee concentrate, once concentrated, may have an extended shelf-life that allows for packing, storing, and transporting of the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of brewing a flash brewed coffee concentrate includes flash brewing ground coffee to brew a hot coffee extract and mixing the hot coffee extract with a frozen concentrated coffee extract to chill the hot coffee extract to a temperature less than 130° F. while increasing the concentration of the hot coffee extract to form the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In embodiments, the method includes coarsely grinding roasted coffee beans to form the ground coffee before flash brewing the ground coffee. The method may include roasting the coffee beans to a 66 or less on the Agtron degree of roast scale before grinding the roasted coffee beans. The coffee beans may be roasted for at least seven minutes at a temperature of at least 388° F. In some embodiments, flash brewing the ground coffee brews the hot coffee extract having a concentration in a range of 3° Brix to 12° Brix. Mixing the hot coffee extract with the frozen concentrated coffee extract may increase the concentration of the hot coffee extract to greater than 15° Brix to form the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In certain embodiments, flash brewing the ground coffee includes brewing the ground coffee in a range of 5 to 25 minutes in water having a temperature in a range of 165° F. to 205° F. The method may include thawing the frozen concentrated coffee extract before mixing with the hot coffee extract. Thawing the frozen concentrated coffee extract may include thawing the frozen concentrated coffee extract to a temperature equal to or less than 41° F. In particular embodiments, mixing the hot coffee extract with the frozen concentrated coffee extract includes adding the frozen concentrated coffee extract to a mixing kettle and adding the hot coffee extract to the mixing kettle after the frozen concentrated coffee extract is within the mixing kettle. Adding the frozen concentrated coffee extract may include pumping a slurry of the frozen concentrated coffee extract into the mixing kettle. In embodiments, the method may include heating the flash brewed coffee concentrate after mixing and chilling the flash brewed coffee concentrate to a temperature of less than 45° F. after heating. Heating the flash brewed coffee concentrate may include heating the flash brewed coffee concentrate to a temperature less than 190° F., e.g., to a temperature in a range of 110° F. to 185° F. The method may include agitating the flash brewed coffee concentrate during heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate. In some embodiments, the method may include using the flash brewed coffee concentrate to produce a ready-to-drink or a ready-to-serve product.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to example embodiments thereof with reference to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. These example embodiments are described so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Features from one embodiment or aspect can be combined with features from any other embodiment or aspect in any appropriate combination. For example, any individual or collective features of method aspects or embodiments can be applied to apparatus, product, or component aspects or embodiments and vice versa. The disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” “the,” and the like include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In addition, while reference may be made herein to quantitative measures, values, geometric relationships or the like, unless otherwise stated, any one or more if not all of these may be absolute or approximate to account for acceptable variations that may occur, such as those due to manufacturing tolerances or engineering tolerances or the like. Referring now to FIGS. 1-6, a method of producing a flash brewed coffee concentrate that has an extended shelf-life that allows for packing, storing, and transporting of the flash brewed coffee concentrate is disclosed herein and generally referred to as method 100 . The flash brewed coffee concentrate that is produced from the method 100 is formed from a high-quality coffee that is quickly brewed with hot water and quickly chilled to stop the brewing process such that the brightness and complexity of the coffee is captured in the coffee extract. As used herein, the term “extract” refers to a product or essence removed from a larger whole. Further, as used herein, the term “coffee concentrate” refers to a brewed and concentrated coffee product that requires further processing before being considered ready-to-serve or ready-to-drink. A coffee concentrate, as described herein, may be ultra-high-temperature (UHT) or aseptically packed before being distributed for use. In addition, a coffee concentrate, as described herein may be processed by further dilution before being distributed. For example, a coffee concentrate may be at 15° Brix such that it is a 1+7 dilution (1-part concentrate+7 parts water, milk, or non-dairy beverage) to make a ready to drink product and be processed by diluting the coffee concentrate to 9° Brix and distributed as a 1+3 dilution. Initially, the method 100 includes roasting the coffee beans (Step 120 ). With particular reference to FIG. 2, before the coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ), green coffee beans 10 (FIG. 6) are selected, procured, or received (Step 112 ). Once the green coffee beans are received (Step 112 ), the green coffee beans are cleaned (Step 114 ). Cleaning the green coffee beans (Step 114 ) may include the use of screens 12 (FIG. 6) and magnets 14 (FIG. 6) to remove impurities from the green coffee beans. Once the green coffee beans are cleaned (Step 114 ), the green coffee beans may be blended (Step 116 ). For example, the green coffee beans may be blended using a thru blend scale 16 (FIG. 6). In some embodiments, green coffee beans from specific regions may be blended to achieve a desired flavor profile in the extract ultimately produced from the method 100 . Once the green coffee beans are cleaned and blended, the green coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ). The green coffee beans may be roasted in a coffee roaster 20 (FIG. 6) until the beans are at or below 66 on the Agtron degree of roast scale. For example, the green coffee beans may be roasted in a range of 25 to 60 on the Agtron degree of roast scale. To achieve the desired roast, the green coffee beans may be roasted at a minimum temperature of 388° F. for a minimum 7 minutes. The roasting time may vary depending on the degree of roast desired. Referring now to FIG. 3, once the coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ), the roasted coffee beans are ground (Step 130 ). The roasted coffee beans may be coarsely ground, e.g., a chunky grind, in a coffee grinder 30 (FIG. 6). Between roasting (Step 120 ) and grinding (Step 130 ), the roasted coffee beans may pass through several quality control and/or safety steps such as destoning (Step 122 ) or passing the roasted coffee beans past magnets, e.g., rare earth magnets 32 (FIG. 6). The steps 122 may remove impurities from the roasted coffee beans before grinding. Removing impurities from the roasted coffee beans may prevent impurities in the extract ultimately produced from method 100 and/or prevent damage to equipment used to grind the coffee beans and equipment downstream thereof. In addition, after the roasted coffee beans are ground (Step 130 ), the ground coffee may be screened (Step 132 ) to ensure that the ground coffee is satisfactorily ground. The screening (Step 132 ) may also remove small granules of coffee from the grinding process and/or impurities from the ground coffee. For example, the screening (Step 132 ) may have a first screen 34 (FIG. 6) that requires the ground coffee to pass through and a second screen 36 (FIG. 6), having a finer mesh, that prevents the desired ground coffee from passing through. The screening subsequent to grinding (Step 132 ) may ensure a relative uniformity of the ground coffee. With reference to FIG. 4, the ground coffee is then flash brewed (Step 140 ) to bring out the brightness/acidity and complexity of the coffee without drawing out bitter/astringent notes of the coffee. The flash brewing process (Step 140 ) may use a single-wall stainless steel vessel 40 (FIG. 6) with an open top that is covered by a separate stainless-steel cover 42 (FIG. 6). In some embodiments, the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) occurs at atmospheric pressure such that the brewer is not a pressurized brewer. The ground coffee may be placed into a nylon filter bag that is inserted into a stainless-steel perforated brew basket 44 (FIG. 6) of the brewer (Step 142 ). With the ground coffee in the nylon filter bag, hot water is added to the brewer (Step 144 ). The hot water may be in a range of 165° F. to 205° F. and more specifically in a range of 180° F. to 185° F. Once the hot water is added to the brewer (Step 144 ), the ground coffee is contacted with or exposed to the hot water (Step 146 ). The contacting or exposing of the ground coffee to the hot water is done in a manner to promote even saturation of the ground coffee with the hot water. The ground coffee may steep in the hot water for a range of 5 minutes to 25 minutes, e.g., 20 minutes. In some embodiments, the ground coffee is plunged into the hot water. Plunging may include plunging the coffee in the nylon filter bag into the hot water using a hand device. Additionally or alternatively, contacting or exposing the ground coffee with the hot water may include mixing or submerging the ground coffee in hot water to saturate the ground coffee in the hot water or circulating the hot water over the ground coffee. After the ground coffee is contacted by or exposed to the hot water (Step 146 ) and during the steeping, the ground coffee may be agitated in the hot water (Step 147 ) one or more subsequent times to aid in contact of the hot water with the ground coffee. The agitation of the ground coffee in the hot water (Step 147 ) occurs before removal of the entire brew basket from the hot water. The agitation of the ground coffee in the hot water in the brewer (Step 147 ) may occur at one or more predetermined times or intervals during the steeping of the ground coffee, e.g., 5, 10, or 15 minutes. Agitation may include re-plunging or stirring ground coffee within the hot water or shifting the position of a nylon bag or brew basket within the hot water. Additionally or alternatively, it may include circulating hot water over the ground coffee. The short brew time at a high temperature can be referred to as a “flash hot brew”. It will be appreciated that the short steeping or brewing time in hot water may be optimal to bring out the brightness/acidity and complexity of the ground coffee without drawing out bitter/astringent notes of the ground coffee. Further, the short brew time may prevent over-steeping and thus over-extraction from the ground coffee. Further, the short brew time may minimize oxidation of the brewed hot coffee extract by reducing exposure to air during the brewing process. After the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) is complete, e.g., reached the desired steeping time, the brew basket is removed (Step 148 ) from hot coffee liquid extract within the brewer to stop the brewing process and to separate the ground coffee from the hot coffee extract. Specifically, the brew basket including the coffee grounds in the nylon filter bag is lifted or hoisted from the out of the brewer. The brew basket may be allowed to drain over the brewer for a predetermined time to allow additional hot coffee extract to drain from the ground coffee grounds in the brew basket into the hot coffee extract within the brewer. The brew basket may be allowed to drain in a range of 5 minutes to 20 minutes, e.g., in a range of 10 minutes to 15 minutes. During the brewing process, from the contacting of the ground coffee with the hot water (Step 146 ) to the removal of the brew basket (Step 148 ) the temperature of the hot coffee extract in the brewer may drop below 180° F. while remaining above 145° F. After flash brewing (Step 140 ), the hot coffee extract in the brewer has a concentration less than 15° Brix, e.g., in a range of 3° Brix to 12° Brix. Other flash brewing processes are contemplated to produce a hot coffee extract having a desired concentration less than 15° Brix. For example, a “continuous” brewing processes can be used to produce a hot coffee extract having a desired concentration less than 15° Brix. Referring now to FIG. 5, when the hot coffee extract in the brewer has a concentration within a desired range and/or the desired steep time of the flash brew process is complete (Step 140 ) and the hot coffee extract has been separated from the brewer (Step 148 ), the hot coffee extract is rapidly chilled (Step 160 ). To rapidly chill the hot coffee extract to below 130° F. (Step 160 ), frozen concentrated coffee extract 50 (FIG. 6) that has been previously roasted, processed, and frozen is thawed to a temperature suitable for pumping or flowing the frozen concentrated coffee extract into a mixing kettle (Step 152 ). The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be thawed to a temperature less than or equal to 41° F. In some embodiments, the frozen concentrated coffee extract is thawed to a temperature in a range of 18° F. to 38 ° F., e.g., 25° F. The thawed frozen concentrated coffee extract is then pumped or added to a mixing kettle (Step 154 ). The thawed frozen concentrated coffee extract may be added in the form of a slurry with some portions of the frozen concentrated coffee extract being in a solid, frozen phase and other portions being in a liquid phase. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be pumped or added to the mixing kettle 60 (FIG. 6) with minimal agitation to the frozen concentrated coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be pumped or added to the mixing kettle (Step 154 ) prior to, during, or after the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) of the hot coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may have a concentration in a range of 18° Brix to 45° Brix. The frozen concentrated coffee extract within the mixing kettle may include an antifoam agent. In some embodiments, the antifoam agent may be added to the frozen concentrated coffee extract after the frozen concentrated coffee extract is in the mixing kettle, may be added as the frozen concentrated coffee extract is being pumped into the mixing kettle, may be included in the frozen concentrated coffee extract, or may be included in hot coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract is concentrated without heating of a coffee extract used to form the frozen concentrated coffee extract. For example, the frozen concentrated coffee extract may be formed from freezing a brewed coffee to remove water from the brewed coffee to increase a concentration of the brewed coffee. With the hot coffee extract brewed and separated by removing the brew basket from the hot coffee extract (Step 148 ) and the frozen concentrated coffee extract in the mixing kettle (Step 154 ), the hot coffee extract is pumped from the brewer into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped from the brewer into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ), the hot coffee extract may be filtered (Step 158 ). The filtering of the hot coffee extract may remove particulates including, but not limited to, ground coffee from the hot coffee extract, e.g., coffee fines. The filtering of the hot coffee extract (Step 158 ) may include passing the hot coffee extract through a dual stage micron filter bank 48 (FIG. 6). As the hot coffee extract is pumped into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ), the hot coffee extract is mixed with and chilled by the frozen concentrated coffee extract within the mixing kettle to form a flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 160 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped into the mixing kettle, the frozen concentrated coffee extract rapidly chills the hot coffee extract to a temperature less than 130° F. while increasing the concentration of the hot coffee extract such that the flash brewed coffee concentrate within the mixing kettle has a concentration greater than 15° Brix. In some embodiments, the frozen concentrated coffee extract may rapidly chill the hot coffee extract to a temperature in a range of 75° F. to 110° F. and more particularly, in a range of 85° F. to 95° F. The rapid chilling of the hot coffee extract (Step 160 ) stops any further heat exposure and stops oxidation of the hot coffee extract as the hot coffee extract is mixed with the frozen concentrated coffee extract to produce the flash brewed coffee concentrate. Referring back to FIG. 1, after the flash brewed coffee concentrate is mixed (Step 160 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be briefly heated to a temperature less than 190° F., e.g., in a range of 110° F. to 185° F., to a temperature of less than 175° F., e.g., in a range of 160° F. to 170° F., or to a temperature of less than 135° F., e.g., in a range of 110° F. to 130° F., for a predetermined time to ensure that the frozen concentrated coffee extract is fully melted and that any coffee solids within the flash brewed coffee concentrate are evenly distributed within the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ). During the brief heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be agitated. For example, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be agitated in the mixing kettle at a rate of 30% to 50%. The heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate and/or agitation of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may occur for 2 minutes to 5 minutes, e.g., 3 minutes. It will be appreciated that keeping the temperature to less than 190° F. may prevent the flavor development from being affected by the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ). A heat exchanger may be used to circulate flash brewed coffee concentrate to and from the mixing kettle until the desired temperature is reach or the mixing kettle 60 may include a water or steam jacket 62 (FIG. 6) that allows for controlled heating of the mixing kettle 60 . Before, during, or after the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), a sensory evaluation of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be conducted (Step 172 ). The sensory evaluation may include, but not be limited to, taste, smell, opacity, or color evaluation. After the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate is chilled to a temperature less than 45° F. (Step 180 ). The chilling of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 180 ) may be completed by pumping the flash brewed coffee concentrate from the mixing kettle and through a heat exchanger to chill the flash brewed coffee concentrate. The chilled flash brewed coffee concentrate may be filtered to remove any remaining undesirable materials from the chilled flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 182 ), e.g., coffee fines or foreign materials. While remaining at a temperature less than 45° F., the flash brewed coffee concentrate is a refrigerated finished product that may be stored or packed for shipping. For example, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be packed in 275 gallon totes 70 (FIG. 6), 55 gallon drums, or other suitable food-grade containers. The flash brewed coffee concentrate may have a shelf-life of at least three months when kept sealed at a temperature less than 45° F. The flash brewed coffee concentrate, described herein, may be intended to be shipped refrigerated in bulk form for further diluting with water, dairy, or non-dairy solution. In some embodiments, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be processed and packaged into smaller containers used in food service or retail applications including, but not limited to, pints, quarts, gallon PET or HDPE bottles, or 3 liter to 3 gallon bags-in-box (BIBs). The processing of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may include UHT processing or aseptic packaging. In some embodiments, the processing of the flash brewed coffee concentrate includes diluting the flash brewed coffee concentrate to a predetermined concentration, e.g., 1+7 dilution or 1+3 dilution. The flash brewed coffee concentrate may be prepared as a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage by mixing one-part flash brewed coffee concentrate with one or more parts liquid solution, such as water, milk, or non-dairy solution. This mixing may occur automatically in a dispenser or can be mixed and placed in a dispenser or pitcher at the establishment or in a home. It is contemplated that a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage may be a shelf-stable beverage or a refrigerated beverage that has been premixed at a processor with water, milk, or other non-dairy solution e.g., almond milk. In some embodiments, a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage may be premixed and packaged by a processor into single serve containers, pints, quarts, gallon PET or HDPE bottles, or 3 liter to 3 gallon bags-in-box (BIBs). While several embodiments of the disclosure have been shown in the drawings, it is not intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is intended that the disclosure be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Any combination of the above embodiments is also envisioned and is within the scope of the appended claims. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of particular embodiments. Those skilled in the art will envision other modifications within the scope of the claims appended hereto.","20210251252"

FIELD The present invention relates to the field of preparation of coffee beverages by a coffee machine using capsules. The invention more particularly relates to a method and capsule for producing a long liquid coffee extract having a thick and stable head of coffee foam (‘crema’). The invention also relates to a liquid coffee extract with crema. BACKGROUND The preparation of coffee using capsules containing coffee powder has reached a fast increasing commercial success due to the convenience of the coffee preparation, the cleanliness and the quality of the coffee obtained. In particular, for short and medium size coffee such as ristretto (25 ml), espresso (40 ml) or lungo (110 ml), certain existing coffee systems on the market enable to deliver coffees of high quality with a diversified aroma and taste but also a head of pure coffee foam with a uniform and smooth texture also called ‘crema’. The aroma and taste variations can generally be obtained by a careful selection of different blends of roast and ground coffee coming from various origins. Generally, the best short coffee extract is obtained under relatively high pressure of extraction (10-20 bars) and in a relatively short time (less than 60 seconds). An appealing texture of crema generally exhibits a shiny visual appearance and a uniform and very smooth texture without (too many) visible bubbles. The texture should also be persistent for a few tenths of seconds. If the bubbles collapse too rapidly or aggregate into larger ones, the coffee crema loses thickness and the texture providing the attractive mouth feel is poor. A coffee of longer size (i.e., about 230 ml) is usually not extracted at high pressure to avoid an over-extraction and/or the extraction of coffee compounds that can be at the origin of an undesirable taste. A solution for making a long coffee from a capsule may consist in making a smaller coffee volume than the final targeted volume under high pressure conditions and, adding hot water directly in the liquid coffee extract during or after coffee extraction. This method usually delivers what is called an “Americano” coffee. One problem is that the volume of crema is reduced by the addition of hot water. Generally, hot water will cause bubbles to collapse instantaneously or rapidly. U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,765 describes a sealed filter cartridge adapted for use in an automatic machine such as a coffee brewing machine. The coffee is usually prepared by pre-perforating the cartridge and injecting hot water in the cartridge at relatively low pressure. However, the problem is that the coffee obtained is generally considered as “filter coffee”. It is of relatively low intensity. It also exhibits no crema and forms at best a discontinuous thin soapy layer formed of large bubbles rapidly collapsing. Therefore, this method has proven unable to form an attractive crema on a long cup of coffee. Therefore, to date, it does not exist a long coffee liquid extract, obtained by extraction of roast and ground coffee from a capsule in a coffee machine, which exhibits a thick and stable head of foam (hereafter ‘crema’) that would be very appealing for coffee gourmets. It also does also not exist a method for preparing by extraction of roast and ground coffee with hot water in a capsule coffee system, such a long coffee extract. It also does not exist a capsule for a coffee machine capable of delivering such long liquid coffee extract. The purpose of the present invention is to propose a method for providing from a single-use capsule, processed in a coffee machine, a long coffee extract with ‘crema’ that presents a shiny visual appearance as well as a thick, homogeneous and uniform (unctuous) texture. SUMMARY The invention is contained in the appended claims here inserted by reference. The present invention relates to a method for producing a long coffee extract from a capsule in a coffee machine comprising: providing a capsule containing a predetermined dose of roast and ground coffee and the machine supplying hot water within the capsule, extracting liquid coffee extract from the capsule by rotating the capsule about its central axis in the machine for centrifuging and extracting the liquid coffee extract towards the periphery of the capsule while the machine continuing supplying hot water, the machine collecting the liquid coffee extract from the capsule and dispensing the coffee extract in a receptacle; wherein the liquid coffee extract is formed with coffee foam (i.e., ‘crema’) which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height higher than 15 mm in the receptacle, such coffee foam being stable by retaining more than 50% of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction and, wherein the roast and ground coffee has a weight of from 11 to 14 grams, a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 500 micrometer and a roasting degree of from 50 to 80 CTN. It was surprisingly found that a persistent coffee ‘crema’ can be obtained in a centrifugal extraction process by selecting certain coffee parameters, in particular, the weight, the coffee granulometry and the coffee roasting value. The liquid coffee extract is formed with coffee foam which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height even higher than 20 mm, preferably comprised between 20 and 35 mm, most preferably between 25 and 30 mm. The liquid coffee extract is stable after extraction by retaining even more than 60%, most preferably more than 64% of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction. In particular, it was surprisingly found that the coffee roasting degree influences the quality of the coffee crema, and particular, darker roasting were preferred. Roasting is generally a heat treatment on green coffee beans which modifies the physico-chemical bean properties (density, microstructure, oil migration, etc.) thereby resulting in the development of the aroma, flavour and colour of the beans. Preferably, optimal results were obtained when the roast and ground coffee has a roasting degree of from 55 to 70 CTN, more preferably of from 58 to 65 CTN. Such roasting degree essentially corresponds to a dark roasted coffee powder. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 350 micrometer. Preferably, roast and ground coffee has a fines content of from 10 and 30% in volume. Preferably, the fines content is preferably of from 15 to 30% in volume. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a weight of from 12 to 13.5 grams. With such a coffee weight, it is possible to produce coffee extract with excellent crema, high intensity but without over-extraction. Surprisingly, it was found that under these selected product and extraction process conditions, a persistent coffee crema can be obtained for a long coffee extract while also significantly avoiding the coffee over-extraction that generates undesired bitter or unpleasant flavour and/or taste notes. The liquid coffee extract as obtained by the method of the invention provides a long coffee liquid extract with good intensity and body. Generally, the intensity can be set higher than for long filter coffee. In particular, the liquid extract has preferably a coffee yield of from 20 to 30% wt. Preferably, the liquid extract has a total solids of from 1.0 to 1.55% wt, more preferably of from 1.25 to 1.55% wt. The coffee is not over-extracted so that the coffee is not bitter and the natural coffee aromatic notes (such as cereal, fruity or juicy notes) are promoted. The quality of coffee crema can be impacted by the water and/or coffee temperatures. The control of temperatures preferably involves the temperature of water before it is supplied to the capsule (i.e., “hot water temperature”) and the temperature of coffee as dispensed in the coffee receptacle (i.e., “in-cup temperature”). Preferably, hot water is heated before being supplied within the capsule at temperature comprised of from 70 to 95° C., more preferably, of from 75 to 90° C. In addition, the coffee extract is kept warm when collected to be dispensed at in-cup temperature of the coffee extract above 60° C., preferably above 65° C., most preferably of from 70° C. to 80° C. The in-cup temperature is a compromise between the need to not reduce the stability of crema with a too high temperature and the need to serve a coffee sufficiently hot for the consumer. The in-cup temperatures are preferably controlled by controlling the temperature of the collecting means which collects the liquid extract and/or of the dispensing means such as the coffee outlet of the machine. For instance, the collecting means can comprise an annular U-shaped collector associated with a heating means such as described in co-pending international patent application WO2010/089329. The extraction of coffee is generally obtained by rotating the capsule about its central axis in the coffee machine and passing hot water through the roast and ground coffee in the direction from the center to the periphery of the capsule. In other words, the extraction is obtained by creating centrifugation forces on the liquid circulating through the bed of coffee in the capsule; such forces generating a gradient of pressure of liquid which is prone to extract the coffee solid and volatile compounds from the coffee particles. The formed coffee extract is moved to the periphery of the capsule where it leaves the capsule through a plurality of peripheral outlets. Such peripheral outlets may, for instance, be perforated by perforated means of the machine and/or be pre-made before insertion of the capsule in the machine. In the preferred method, the hot water is supplied in the capsule until the capsule is filled under pressure with hot water. In the water filling step, the volume of water which is supplied in the capsule may vary but generally is sufficient to fully wet the coffee powder. The flow rate of the water in the filling step is controlled to not exceed a certain pressure in the capsule and to prevent blocking of the coffee flow. In general, the flow rate is lower than the flow rate during the subsequent coffee extraction step. Preferably, the water is filled in the capsule at a flow rate of about 80 to 150 ml/min. Such controlled hot water filling enables to improve the release of the coffee volatile compounds during extraction. The suitable prefilling volume of water may vary but is preferably about 0.5 to 3 times the net volume of roast and ground coffee in the capsule. Advantageously, during extraction of the coffee extract from the capsule, the flow of coffee extract passes a flow restriction means. The flow restriction means is preferably provided at or immediately close to the annular periphery of the capsule. The flow restriction means ensures a sufficient residence time of liquid in the capsule and an improved extraction of the coffee compounds. The restriction means can be formed by a spring-biased pressure ring that engages on the capsule to hinder the flow of coffee extract and is lifted to open a flow path under the effect of the pressure of the coffee extract acting thereon. This method surprisingly shows a great ability for producing high volume of unctuous ‘crema’ while still maintaining the characteristics of the coffee extract (yield, total solids) within preferred ranges. The mean flow rate of the hot water during extraction is more preferably of from 80 to 250 ml/min, even more preferably of from 120 to 200 ml/min. The flow rate can be controlled to control the coffee intensity and avoid coffee over-extraction. The flow rate of hot water can depend on the coffee blend which is selected. In a possible mode, the hot water flow rate is varied during extraction such as be increased or decreased in a continuous manner or stepwise. Moreover, the hot water flow rate can be controlled during at least two separate phases having different flow rate thresholds, even more preferably three separate phases with two or three different thresholds of flow rates. In the preferred method, the capsule is rotated to provide centrifugal forces in the capsule that forces heated water through the coffee and enables the coffee to be extracted at relatively low pressure. Preferably, during extraction of the liquid coffee extract, the mean value of the water pressure (“mean pressure”) supplied within the capsule is of from 700 mbar to 1 bar. The flow rate is influenced by the pressure in the system and the rotational speed. For this, the rotational speed is controlled to match the target(s) of water flow rate. The capsule can be rotated at a rotational speed is of from 3000 to 6000 rpm during extraction. The rotational speed can be increased or decreased during extraction to match a set value of flow rate or an increasing or decreasing profile of flow rates. In a possible mode, the flow rate is varied during extraction by applying two or three sequential phases; each having a set value of flow rate or an increasing or decreasing profile of flow rate. The invention further relates to a single-use capsule for producing a long coffee extract with a thick and stable coffee foam in a coffee machine containing a predetermined dose of roast and ground coffee having a weight of from 11 to 14 grams, a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 500 micrometer and a roasting degree of from 50 to 80 CTN, and, preferably a fines content of from 10 to 30% in volume. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 350 micrometer. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a fines content of from 15 to 30% in volume. The capsule of the invention is extractable in a centrifugal coffee machine to deliver a long coffee extract formed with coffee foam (‘crema’) which exhibits in a receptacle of reference an initial height larger than 15 mm, such coffee foam being stable after extraction by retaining more than 50% of its initial height at 180 seconds. Preferably, the capsule is extractable to form a liquid coffee extract with coffee foam which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height even higher than 20 mm, preferably comprised between 20 and 35 mm, most preferably between 25 and 30 mm. The capsule is also extractable to form a liquid coffee extract which is stable after extraction by retaining even more than 60% of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction. The stability is preferably between 60 and 80%. The capsule preferably may comprise a cup-shaped body forming a cavity containing the roast and ground coffee, a circular annular flange like rim and an upper wall member sealed onto the rim. The upper wall member can be a sealing membrane made of aluminium and/or polymer. The upper wall member may also be a lid or a membane with pre-made inlet and/or peripheral outlets. In order to reduce oxidation of the coffee powder, the capsule of the invention preferably forms by itself an oxygen-tight package or forms a package with very low oxygen permeability such as using barrier packaging materials such as EVOH and the like. It preferably contains the roast and ground coffee with saturation of the free volume with protective gas such as N 2 and/or CO 2 . The capsule may also forms a package permeable to oxygen but sealed by a secondary (over-)package which is oxygen-tight or with exhibits very low oxygen permeability with barrier packaging materials such as EVOH and the like. The internal volume of the capsule is sized as a function of the amount of roast and ground coffee contained in the capsule and to the volume of water to be received in for filling the capsule for pre-wetting the coffee before extraction. The suitable prefilling volume of water may vary but is preferably about 0.5 to 3 times the net volume of coffee. The invention also relates to the use of a capsule as aforementioned for the production of a liquid coffee extract. In particular, the invention relates to the use of a capsule for the production of a long coffee extract in a centrifugal coffee machine in which the capsule is rotated about its central axis for centrifuging and extracting the liquid coffee extract for producing a liquid coffee extract formed with coffee foam (i.e., ‘crema’) which exhibits in a receptacle of reference an initial height larger than 15 mm, preferably more than 20 mm, such coffee foam being stable after extraction by retaining more than 50%, preferably more than 60%, of its initial height at 180 seconds. The invention further relates to a liquid coffee extract having a volume of 230 (+/−5) ml obtained by extraction of roast and ground coffee from a capsule in a coffee machine, with a head of foam (i.e., crema) which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height higher than 15 mm, preferably more than 20 mm in the receptacle of reference, such coffee foam being stable by retaining more than 50%, preferably more than 60%, of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction. The crema stability is preferably between 60 and 80%. Preferably, the liquid coffee extract of the invention has a coffee yield of from 20 to 30% wt. Preferably, the liquid coffee extract of the invention a total solids of from 1.0 to 1.55% wt, preferably of from 1.25 to 1.55. Definitions In the present description, terms are utilized for which the definitions are given below. In the context of the present invention, the term “long coffee extract” represents a liquid coffee extract of 230 (+/−5) ml. The “extraction” is defined as the period the liquid coffee extract is dispensed from the capsule and collected in the receptacle. The “coffee weight” represents the weight of the predetermined dose of roast and ground coffee contained in the capsule in the sealed or storage packaging conditions of the capsule. The “roasting degree” refers to the CTN value converted from a score measured at room temperature by a coffee roast analyzer Agtron E20 CP-II. The Agtron analyzer measures the amount of near-infrared energy at specific wave lengths reflected from the surface of the sample. The score given by Agtron analyzer is converted by the conversion chart “Neuhaus Neotec Colortest vs. Agtron Conversion Chart” given by Modern Process Equipment Chicago, Ill. The “crema” is defined as the head of foam created on the coffee extract with a creamy texture formed of substantially small bubbles. The “initial height” of the coffee crema is measured in a “receptacle of reference” (as referred in the present application) having a defined capacity and dimensions illustrated in FIG. 5. The “stability” of coffee crema is determined by the remaining percentage of the initial height of crema at 180 seconds immediately after dispensing of the coffee extract (or extraction) into the receptacle of reference by the coffee outlet of the machine. The “mean flow rate” is determined by a flow meter positioned after the water heater and before the water injection needle or injection point in the capsule. The “mean water pressure” represents the averaged pressure of water above atmospheric pressure in the water dispensing line of the coffee machine after the water heater and before the injection needle or injection point in the capsule. The water pressure is typically measured by a pressure sensor. The mean diameter D 4,3 represents the volume mean diameter of the coffee particles. This value is determined by laser diffraction method a Camsizer XT instrument commercialized by Retsch company. The method uses dynamic image analysis (ISO 13322-2) and air pressure dispersion. The measuring method is generally taking more than 250 images per second; each with approximately 1.3 MPixel. The resolution is about 1 micron. The width of analysis area is 25 mm (FoV). This equipment uses the principle of digital image processing. The “fines” are all the small coffee particles having a diameter below or equal to 100 microns when measured by the Camsizer XT equipment. The percentage of fines in the coffee powder is expressed in volume. The “extraction yield” is defined as the total weight of total solids in the coffee extract divided by the total weight of roast and ground coffee contained in the capsule. This value is expressed in percentage by weight. Yield   ( % ) = Tc   ( % ) * Weight   extract coffee   weight The “total solids” is defined as the weight of extracted solids contained in the liquid coffee extract divided by the total weight of the liquid coffee extract. This value is expressed in percentage by weight. The “hot water temperature” is determined by the temperature of water inside the heater or of the heating block of the heater in contact with water as determined by a temperature sensor. The “in-cup temperature” is determined by the temperature of the liquid coffee extract at its center immediately after being dispensed in the receptacle from the coffee machine. The temperature is measured at room temperature (23+/−3° C.). The temperature is measured with a calibrated temperature sensor (thermocouple K type supplied by Thermocontrol) in the receptacle of reference.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 relates to a preferred, non-limiting, embodiment of a capsules 1 according to the invention. The capsule is for a single use and designed to deliver a beverage from a beverage producing device or coffee machine. The capsule preferably comprise a cup-shaped body 2 , a circular, annular flange-like rim 3 and an upper wall member of disc form, preferably, a perforable membrane 4 . The cup-shaped body 2 may be shaped as a bowl as illustrated or other forms. Thereby, the membrane 4 and the body 2 enclose an enclosure respectively ingredient compartment 6 . As shown in the figure, the membrane 4 is preferably connected onto an inner annular flange portion of the rim 3 that is for example between 1 to 5 mm. The membrane 4 is connected to the rim 3 of the body by a seal such as a heat or ultrasonic weld line. The rim 3 is not necessarily horizontal as illustrated. It can be slightly bent, upwards or downwards, in order to increase the resistance of the seal to the increasing pressure pushing on the membrane with time, due to degassing of the capsule substance or ingredient with time. The rim 3 of the capsules preferably extends outwardly in a direction essentially perpendicular (as illustrated) or slightly inclined (if bent as aforementioned) relative to the central axis of symmetry I of the body corresponding to the axis of rotation Z of the capsule 1 in the beverage production device (see FIG. 2). Thereby, the axis of symmetry I is aligned with the axis of rotation Z during centrifugation of the capsule in the brewing device. It should be understood that the shown bowl-shaped embodiment of the capsule is just an exemplary embodiment and that the capsule in particular the capsule body 2 according to the invention can take various different shapes. The body 2 has a convex portion 5 of depth d. However, the portion 5 may as well be a truncated or a cylindrical portion or a combination of portions of different shapes such as truncated, cylindrical, spherical, etc. The body 2 of the capsules is preferably rigid or semi-rigid. It can be formed of a food grade plastic, e.g., polypropylene, with a gas barrier layer such as EVOH and the like or aluminium or a laminate of plastic and aluminium, such as aluminium-PP (polypropylene) laminate, wherein preferably PP forms the inner layer of the laminate and aluminium forms the outer layer of the laminate. Additional lacquers or colour layers can be provided. The membrane may also be formed of paper and plastic, paper and aluminium or a combination of paper, aluminium and plastic. Plastic also includes biodegradable plastics such as crystallized PLA or equivalent. The membrane 4 can be made of a thinner material such as a plastic film also including a barrier layer or aluminium or a combination of plastic and aluminium. The membrane 4 is usually of a thickness between 10 and 250 microns, for example. The membrane is perforated for creating the water inlet as will be described later in the description. The membrane also further comprises a perforable peripheral area. Instead of the membrane 4 , the capsules 1 may as well comprise rigid, semi-rigid or flexible engagement lid member which preferably has the form of a disc comprising a central portion having an inlet port for enabling the introduction of a water injection member and a peripheral portion having circumferentially arranged outlet openings. For instance, the outlet openings can be formed by an annular layer of filter paper and/or plastic fabric. The inlet port and outlet openings are thereby premade before insertion of the capsule in the device. They can be covered by a removable gas-tight layer before insertion such as an overwrapping package or a peelable membrane. The capsule 1 is intended for delivery of a long-size coffee, more particularly, liquid coffee extract of 230 ml. The long-size coffee capsule 1 preferably contains an amount of ground coffee between 11 and 14 grams. The filling level of substance in the capsule and /or volume of the capsule is also set to ensure the filling of hot water during a pre-wetting step. Preferably, the capsules in the set according to the invention may contain different blends of roast and ground coffee or coffees from different origins and/or having different roasting and/or grinding characteristics. The capsules of the invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 4, more particularly comprises at its flange-like rim 3 , an annular pressure-setting ring 8 protruding, both upwardly and downwardly from the inward flange portion 7 . In particular, the pressure-setting ring, whose function will be explained later on, comprises an upper portion extending, in the axial direction of the capsule, above a plane passing by the flange portion 7 and preferably a lower portion 10 extending below the plane still in axial direction of the capsule. By convention, the reference to plane is here taken along the lower surface of the flange portion 7 . In the context of the invention, the term “axial direction” refers to any direction aligned or parallel to the central axis I of the capsule. The term “transversal direction” refers to any direction perpendicular to the central axis I or inclined of an angle greater than 45 degrees. The term “lower” and “upper” refer here to the relative positions of the means, as illustrated, when the upper wall 4 of the capsule is oriented upwards and the bottom of the body 2 downwards. FIG. 2 shows a view of a coffee machine according to an example of the invention in a closed state thereof. Thereby, the device comprises a rotating capsule holder 20 , a rotary driving means 21 (e.g., rotary motor), and a collector 22 onto which the centrifuged liquid impacts and drains through a beverage outlet 23 . The driving means 21 comprises a rotary motor which is linked to the capsule holder 20 at the bottom side (as illustrated) or top side (not illustrated) through an axle 24 axially connected to the capsule holder. The capsule holder 20 has a circumferential surface that forms a referencing diameter substantially equal to an insertion diameter of the body of the capsule 1 so as to ensure a tight fit of the capsule in the capsule holder 20 without possible radial play. It should be noted that the capsule holder can take various shapes and may also be formed of a simple annular hollow ring. Furthermore, the device comprises water injection means 25 having an injection member 26 being arranged to perforate the membrane 4 of the capsule 1 in a central portion thereof. As described in WO2008/148604, cited here as reference, the injection means 26 are connected to a liquid circuit 28 comprising a water supply 29 such as a water tank, a pump 30 and waterheating apparatus 31 for providing a predefined volume of heated pressurized water to the capsule 1 during the beverage extraction process. The water is fed in the capsule by injection through the injection member 26 having the form of a hollow needle or tube. Additional heating means (not illustrated) are provided to maintain the coffee extract warm when dispensed in the collector 22 . The injection member can be formed of a sharp free end to ensure perforation of the upper wall, if necessary. The device also comprises a series of outlet perforators 27 as described in WO2008/0148604. The outlet perforators are provided at the periphery of an extraction interface 33 which engages against the upper wall of the capsule during closure of the device. Accordingly, outlets are produced in an annular portion of the membrane 4 thereby enabling an extracted (centrifuged) beverage to leave the capsule 1 during the rotational movement thereof. The device further comprises a control unit 40 which controls the different elements of the device, in particular, the pump 30 , heater 31 and rotational speed of the driving means 21 . In particular, the control unit is programmed to adjust operational parameters during extraction including (but not limited) to: water pump flow rate, the water temperature, rotational speed and the different coffee preparation phases cycles, i.e., pre-wetting, extraction, drying. Several programs can be designed specifically to different capsules, for example delivering liquid coffee extract having specific intensity and ‘crema’ characteristics. The capsules can comprise an identification code, such as a barcode, radio-frequency tag, etc., for enabling the identification in the device and for setting of operational parameters automatically. In this case, the device comprises suitable code reading means associated to the control unit. The system of the invention comprises a flow restriction means 18 capable of providing a back-pressure against the centrifuged liquid that leaves the capsule through its outlets (perforated or premade). The valve means 18 is formed by the complementary engagement of the device on the capsule. More particularly (FIG. 4), the device comprises a valve member 34 which is arranged circumferentially relative to the extraction interface 33 and which has a lower annular pressing surface 35 . On the capsule's side, the flow restriction means comprises the pressure-setting ring 8 which is engaged by the annular pressing surface 35 of the valve member 34 of the device. The pressing surface 35 engages onto the upper portion of the pressure-setting ring under a predetermined backpressure. The pressure engagement of the two complementary portions 34 , 8 of the flow restriction means is made resilient by means of a spring-biasing means such as springs 36 placed between the valve member 34 and an annular counter-force element 37 , connected directly or indirectly to, or part of the extraction interface 33 . A spring means 36 (for instance 6 to 10 springs) can be evenly placed at the periphery, between the portion 34 and element 37 , such as helical or blade springs in parallel to distribute and balance the preload onto the rim of the capsule evenly. The valve member 34 and the injection unit 25 are typically movable with respect to the capsule holder 20 (or vice versa) via a closure system (not shown) in order to enable insertion and ejection of the capsule 1 to and from the capsule holder 20 before respectively after the beverage extraction process. Closure system can be a mechanical and/or hydraulic closure mechanism. Moreover, the extraction interface 33 , the valve member 34 , the capsule 1 and the capsule holder 20 are all rotatable about axis Z during the centrifugation process. The valve member 34 is also made moveable independently from the extraction interface 33 to take into account the different possible thicknesses of the capsules without affecting the relative position of the injection portion when engaged against the capsule. For this, portion 34 can be slidably mounted about extraction interface 33 . A joint 44 , such as an O-ring, can be provided between the two parts 33 , 34 to ensure liquid-tightness of the flow restriction means. On the capsule's holder side, the pressure-setting ring 8 can be firmly supported by a lowered portion or recess 38 of the supporting edge of the capsule holder 20 . The lowered portion or recess 38 is lowered relative to a flange-supporting portion 39 of the edge of the capsule holder which holds the flange portion 7 of the rim. The extraction of the beverage out of the capsule 1 is obtained by driving the extraction interface 33 of the injection unit 25 , the flow restriction means 18 , the capsule holder 20 and capsule together, in rotation about axis Z, at a high rotational speed, e.g., between 3500 and 5000 rpm, that can be constant or variable. The rotational speed must be sufficient during extraction to create a centrifugal pressure of liquid in the capsule enabling opening of the flow restriction means as described. Hot water which is centrally injected into the capsule 1 tends to be guided along the inner surface of the side wall of the body 2 , up to the inner side of the membrane 4 , and then through the perforated outlet openings created in the membrane 4 by the perforating members 24 then through the valve means 18 between surface 35 and top of the ring 8 . Liquid can be filtered by the interstice created between the perforators 27 and the membrane 4 to ensure that most coffee particles are kept in the capsule. Due to the centrifugation of the liquid in the capsule 1 , the liquid and the roast and ground coffee powder provided within the capsule are made to interact in order to form a coffee liquid extract. FIG. 4 illustrates the system when beverage is centrifuged out of the capsule and the flow restriction means is opened sufficiently so that liquid passes between the pressure-setting ring 8 and the flow restriction member 34 . Centrifuged beverage is given a sufficient pressure upstream the valve means to open it and create an annular restriction opening 42 for liquid flow to be projected towards the impact wall 46 of the collector at high velocity. Opening of the valve means is again obtained by the liquid forcing the valve member 34 to further urge against the springs 36 . It should be noted that a small liquid leakage between the flow restriction means 18 and the ring 8 can be required that helps to vent the gas or air contained in the capsule during the filling of the capsule with water at the beginning of the beverage preparation process (pre-wetting or filling step). After filling of the capsule with hot water and during the extraction phase, water continues to be fed in the capsule by the water pump at a controlled water flow rate or flow rates. Preferably, the rotational speed is controlled to match a preferred water flow rate of reference. Water flow rate can be measured by a flow meter placed in the fluid circuit downstream of the water pump and controlled by control unit 40 . The rotational speed fluctuates during extraction phase to match a flow rate of reference as preset in the control unit. The extraction step can be divided in different successive phases with different flow rate targets or (increasing or decreasing) profiles of flow rates. At the end of the extraction phase, the water pump may be stopped while centrifugation is maintained to empty the capsule from residual liquid (“drying”). More information concerning the control of the coffee production in the machine is described in co-pending patent application PCT/EP13/076448. EXAMPLES Example 1 The following analysis aimed at comparing crema quantity and stability obtained by extracting using centrifugal extraction liquid coffee extracts with different roasting degrees and particle sizes. Product Colombian (100% pure Arabica) coffee has been roasted in a Neuhaus Neotec roaster RFB-S by batches of 400 g at different roasting degrees. The roasting degrees were the following: 100 CTN for “Light roast” (representative of roasting degree range from 110 to 91); 80 CTN for “Medium roast” (representative of roasting degree range from 90 to 71); 60 CTN for “Dark roast” (representative of roasting degree range from 70 to 50). The weight of the roast and ground coffee in the capsule was 13 g. The degasing time was 10 min with O 2 content lower than 2% volume. The characteristics of particle size, measured on the Camsizer XT were the following: Grinding 1 Grinding 2 Grinding 3 Particle size % Particle size % Particle size % (μm) fines (μm) fines (μm) fines Dark 567 5 510 12 504 11 roast 545 6 505 9 407 21 269 21 289 16 232 30 Medium 548 8 486 12 388 26 roast 512 10 469 14 403 18 302 13 267 21 261 22 Light 545 8 488 13 438 15 roast 544 9 479 13 402 18 303 14 284 18 224 29 To facilitate coding of sample, the following code table has been used: Grinding 1 Grinding 2 Grinding 3 Particle % Particle % Particle % size fines size fines size fines Dark D1 D2 D3 roast D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9 Medium M1 M2 M3 roast M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 Light L1 L2 L3 roast L4 L5 L6 L7 L8 L9 To summarize, looking to the average values, granulometry values for each roasting degree were: Range low Range up Dark Particle size (μm) 385 565 roast % fines 5 25 Medium Particle size (μm) 220 311 roast % fines 12 31 Light Particle size (μm) 401 552 roast % fines 6 21 The coffee yield and total solids of the coffee extracts obtained from the dark coffee roast capsules were determined as follows: Dark roast Yield (%) Total Solids (Tc) D1 23.1 1.28 D2 23.2 1.28 D3 24.7 1.36 D4 23.0 1.28 D5 23.2 1.28 D6 26.2 1.45 D7 26.2 1.45 D8 27.9 1.53 D9 27.9 1.53 The coffee yield can vary within a relatively large range. The yield can also be increased with some Robusta coffee in the blend. Receptacle and Characteristics of Coffee Crema As illustrated in FIG. 5, the “receptacle of reference” intended for characterizing the crema of the liquid coffee extract in the present invention was a transparent quartz-type glass having a capacity of 370 ml. The glass had a circular internal bottom flat surface of diameter D 1 equal to 51.7 mm, a top circular larger opening of diameter D 2 equal to 83.7 mm, an internal axial height H of 124 mm and a wall thickness T of 2.3 mm. The side wall was rotationally symmetrical and sloped by widening continuously and essentially rectilinearly from the bottom towards the top opening. The height of crema was measured directly on the glass wall with a ruler. In the results, the values are expressed in centimeter. The stability was calculated at 180 seconds just after dispensing of the coffee extract in the receptacle of reference. Capsule, Machine and Method The capsule was a capsule as described in relation to FIG. 1. The machine was a centrifugal coffee machine Nespresso Vertuo™, which centrifugal extraction principle is described in relation with FIGS. 2 to 4. 230-ml liquid coffee extracts were produced. The extraction was repeated five times for each sample. Crema Results Influence of Roasting Degree on Crema Volume The results are provided in FIG. 7. The X- axis refers to the CTN roasting degree for three values: 60, 80 and 100. The Y-axis refers to the initial height of crema. The roasting degree impact on the crema quantity is significant. The more coffee is roasted, the larger the volume (height) of crema. Influence of Roasting Degree on Crema Stability The results are provided in FIG. 8. The X-axis refers to the CTN roasting degree. The Y-axis refers to the stability in percentage. The roasting degree impact on crema stability is significant. The more the coffee is roasted, the more stable is the crema after extraction. Influence of Particle Size and Fines Content on Crema for Dark Roast Coffee Capsules The results on crema height for the dark roasted coffee capsules are provided in FIG. 9. The X-axis refers to the Dark samples D 1 -D 9 . The Y-axis refers to the initial height of crema. The results on crema stability are provided in FIG. 10. The X-axis refers to the Dark roast samples D 1 -D 9 . The Y-axis refers to the stability of the crema. The D 7 , D 8 and D 9 samples provided the larger initial height of coffee crema with more than 30 mm. The stability of the samples D 2 -D 9 was not significantly different. Sample D 1 had a lower stability. Influence of Particle Size and Fines Content on Crema for Medium Roast Coffee Capsules The results on crema height for the medium roasted coffee capsules are provided in FIG. 11. The results on crema stability are provided in FIG. 12. The crema stability is not significantly different for samples M 2 -M 9 . The height of crema is globally lower than for dark roasted capsules but acceptable. The stability is slightly lower. Influence of Particle Size and Fines Content on Crema for Light Roast Coffee Capsules The results on crema volume for the light roasted coffee capsules are provided in FIG. 13. The results on crema stability for the light roast are provided in FIG. 14. The height of crema is significantly lower than for dark roast coffee capsules. The stability of crema is significantly lower except for L 7 , L 8 and L 9 . Globally, the results show that dark roast coffee capsules provides crema volume in a wide range of particle size and fines contents.

In addition a new type of packaging for coffee is disclosed that maintains the freshness of the bean while allowing easy distribution and verification of bean authenticity. BACKGROUND Coffee has traditionally been made using a three step process: roasting of coffee beans, grinding of roasted beans, and brewing of ground beans in hot water to extract the flavor into a beverage. These three steps are traditionally done at different times and locations. Roasting is typically done in large industrial machines in large batches of many pounds to hundreds of pounds at a time. Roasted beans or ground beans are shipped to local retailers and this step can take weeks to months before the package arrives for the consumer to brew, where the consumer may be the retail home consumer or other businesses such as coffee shops that brew and sell coffee. Roasted beans decay in freshness and taste from the moment the roast is completed as chemical compounds formed in the bean during roasting deteriorate. The decay of roasted beans leads to a less desirable taste of coffee. Thus all coffee made today is stale due to the time delay from roasting to brewing. SUMMARY Embodiments of a coffee preparation machine include at least one pod containing coffee beans, a roasting system that accepts the at least one sealed pod, a grinding system, and a brewing system, where the brewing system, the roasting system, and the grinding system are housed within a single self-contained unit.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The taste of coffee is determined by the type of coffee beans used and by numerous process parameters in each step of making the coffee beverage. A key set of parameters influencing coffee taste, happen during roasting. The roast process is typically done in an industrial batch setting as described above and the end consumer has no control over the roast process and, thus, the taste of the coffee beverage as determined by bean roast. Additionally, the degree of roasting for each bean type can transform the taste of the final coffee beverage to an individual consumer's liking, yet this degree of control does not exist in the coffee industry today. A consumer may buy prepackaged beans with different degrees of roast but the user cannot dial-in and control the roast of beans to taste. Coffee has evolved in recent years from a widespread commodity product with ‘generic’ tasting coffee products to specialty coffee where specific beans, origin location, microclimates, growing conditions, year of production, and processing conditions are tracked and marketed. These variations in the source beans affect the taste of the coffee beverage and, thus, are tracked and marketed to the final consumer. Coffee has many aromatic compounds that affect aroma and taste, where coffee contains more aromatic compounds than wine. Just as wine is marketed by region, year, vineyard, etc., with varying prices for each, coffee can be marketed similarly. A key issue with such marketing is assuring the end consumer that the product being purchased is genuine and not counterfeit. This allows the consumer to know the value of his purchase and to possibly sell that product in the future for value that may increase or decrease. To solve these and other problems we describe a series of embodiments that allow the preparation of the freshest and best tasting coffee ever made. The solution to the problems stated above is to change the method of coffee preparation at the consumer side and to change the distribution method of green coffee beans from plantation to consumer. Coffee Bean Verification Coffee plants are grown in approximately fifty countries worldwide, typically in the tropical regions of the world, at high elevations. The coffee cherry is picked from the plant and after several process steps, dried green coffee beans are produced. These beans can vary widely in quality and taste leading to a large difference in price. Commodity green coffee beans are priced at approximately $2/pound and traded on international commodity markets. Specialty green coffee beans with specific taste and terroir have sold for up to $500/lb. However it is difficult for a person to determine the origin of a green bean by physical observation and, thus, expensive beans may be counterfeited. To prevent counterfeiting, several new embodiments are proposed. As shown in FIG. 1, one embodiment includes laser marking each coffee bean 10 with a laser 12 to create a custom code that is difficult or impossible to copy. A key feature here is to mark the surface of bean only without damage to the inside of the bean. An alternate embodiment includes mechanical marking (not shown) of the surface of each bean with a specific code without damaging the inside of the bean. Embodiments include the application of visual marking material (not shown) to a coffee bean in a custom pattern that cannot be copied. This may include fluorescent materials that emit only when stimulated with the proper external optical stimulus. These materials may be organic (e.g., a green fluorescent protein or other materials) or inorganic. Of key importance is to use only biologically safe materials and materials that burn off during coffee roasting leaving no trace in appearance or taste. In one embodiment, DNA sequencing of beans can be performed on reference bean samples from desired locations. This sequence data can be stored and compared to DNA sequence data of the green coffee beans at a later date to verify location of the bean. DNA can survive in the green coffee bean state, but degrades rapidly with increasing temperature (DNA denatures at just below 100 C). Thus, keeping beans in the green state until final consumption aids verification. Once the beans are roasted, extracting DNA sequence information from the bean becomes difficult or impossible. Such embodiments may provide a novel approach to provenancing. A unique feature of the coffee preparation method embodiments described below is that the roasting is performed at the time of final beverage preparation by the consumer and thus these anti-counterfeiting methods will maintain their integrity through the distribution chain of coffee until the final preparation when verification testing can be performed, if desired. Traditional coffee preparation involves roasting at an earlier stage, as described above, and all marking methods would be destroyed during roasting. A key parameter in specialty coffee is to validate the origin and terroir (special characteristics of the geography, geology and climate of a certain place) that affect coffee taste. This comes under the terminology of food provenancing (chronology of the ownership or location of a historical object). Embodiments include using spectroscopic methods to verify provenance of coffee beans by measuring spectroscopic data (e.g., molecular compounds, ratios of different elements, etc.) as close to the source location as possible and creating a library of coffee bean spectroscopic data. This library of data is used to compare with later spectroscopic measurements for verification when the provenance of any bean is called into question. Spectroscopic techniques to be used may include mass spectrometry, laser spectroscopy, LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy), ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), or any other methods. A key feature of this invention is the use of spectroscopic signature to verify provenance to the location of coffee bean growth and the subsequent ability to verify beans after packaging into coffee pods. By keeping the beans in the green state, this spectroscopic information can be extracted, whereas this information may be destroyed at the temperatures of coffee roasting. Coffee Pod Embodiments A growth area in the coffee market is the use of single-serve coffee pods for consumer preparation of coffee in one cup portions. Advantages of coffee pods include convenience, single serve preparation so that coffee does not sit aging in pots, and ability for consumer to choose amongst pod types. For these reasons, coffee brewing machines using pods have exploded in sales growth in the last decade (e.g., SENSEO, NESPRESSO, KEURIG, etc.). These coffee pods typically are small plastic or metal containers with ground coffee and filter paper inside. These coffee machines and pods all use ground coffee and the machines only brew the coffee. As noted above, coffee degrades in freshness from the moment it is roasted, and degrades even more rapidly once it is ground, since increased surface area interacts with atmosphere. Embodiments include a new type of coffee pod in which green coffee beans are packaged into small enclosed containers or pods, where each pod (e.g., pod 14 shown in FIG. 13) contains enough green coffee beans to ultimately produce one serving of coffee. The pod 14 may be hermetically sealed with a seal 37 . These pods can be used with a specially designed coffee preparation machine that is described herein. The novelty here is to use green coffee beans that have a long shelf life and do not degrade rapidly (shelf life of green coffee beans is years or more if stored properly). The coffee pod 14 is filled with a gas to preserve the enclosed beans without degradation to long periods (years to many years). This fill gas may be atmospheric air, nitrogen, inert gas, noble gas, or the pod 14 may be vacuum packed. In some cases the pod 14 may be filled with positive pressure gas (e.g., nitrogen, noble gas, or others). Each pod 14 would contain approximately 10-50 grams of green coffee beans. In certain cases, certain beans are known to improve with age and exposure to air, where pods 14 containing such beans may be packaged with a ‘breathable membrane’ (not shown) that allows air to be exchanged with the outside world. A further embodiment is to sort and package the green beans with beans of a similar size and color packaged into a single pod 14 , and likewise do this for all pods 14 . The value of this sorting is that roasting of all beans within a single pod will progress similarly when exposed to heat and thus produce a uniform roast. This sorting system may also sort out bad beans that may have phenol content or other impurities that impair taste of the final beverage. Further value of this sorting will become apparent in the discussion of the machine below. The pod 14 can be marked with an information code 38 or bar code (not shown) that contains information about the beans in the pod 14 . This information can be used by the machine described below and will: allow the machine to verify the authenticity of the coffee pod and prevent fake pods from working in the machine, and encode bean information and optimum preparation recipe instructions that the machine can read. The information code may be printed in some form not visible to naked eye to preserve the aesthetic appeal of the pod 14 . The pod 14 may have features built into the design that either prevent tampering with the pod or indicate if tampering has occurred. Other features in the pod package may be deliberately designed to be hard to reproduce to act as anti-counterfeit measures. The pod 14 may be made of recyclable materials. The pod 14 may have features in the physical design to allow non-invasive measurement of the spectral features of the beans to verify provenance of the bean as described above. The pod 14 would be designed in conjunction with the machine described below so that the pod 14 fits into the machine and the machine automatically opens the pod 14 so the green coffee beans can be accessed for processing without contaminating the machine or green beans with remnants of the packaging material. A key goal of the pod 14 and packaging methods mentioned above is to create a pod 14 that is designed for long life of the enclosed beans without bean degradation. In particular, the goal is to create the ecosystem for storing, collecting, trading, and consuming specialty green coffee beans that can be turned into a coffee beverage in an analogous manner to how fine wine is collected, stored, traded, and ultimately consumed. Fine wine may go up or down in value as the provenance of the specific wine gains or loses reputation amongst collectors of wine, and due to supply and demand constraints. Similarly, fine green coffee beans have analogous taste and aroma characteristics that cannot be artificially duplicated, so a limited supply of specialty beans can create a tradable value amongst connoisseurs. The purpose of high quality pod packaging described is to create a long lasting product (lasting years, decades, or longer) that enables a green coffee bean ecosystem to evolve just like the fine wine ecosystem. The coffee pods may be purchased for near term consumption or may be purchased for long term collectible value. The pod 14 may contain green unroasted coffee beans where some processing step has been performed on the beans. One method may be to grind the beans in a factory setting and package the ground green beans into the pod 14 . Grinding the beans first may help in faster roasting of beans (described below in the machine section). Another option may be to partially roast green coffee beans and package into the pod 14 , which may save roasting time for the final consumer. However this partial roasting should be done in a way that preserves the freshness of the bean and prevents the decaying/staleness of the bean as in conventional roasting. E-Commerce Embodiments The coffee machine 16 (FIG. 8) described herein will have an internet connection and can upload and download information to or from computer servers attached to the internet. These servers may be owned and maintained by the company selling the coffee making machine and would provide numerous functions. The company would also maintain a website that would allow the sale of coffee preparation machines and coffee pods 14 . The website would also have information to educate the consumer about the coffee pods and the provenance/terroir of the coffee pods. This information can include professional tasting ratings, user generated feedback forums on taste, and information about the source of each pod 14 . A novel function of the website is allowing the auctioning or trading of coffee pods since the pods are designed to be collectible and may go up or down in value based on supply and demand. This portion of the website may function something like an EBAY for coffee pods, though a number of different auction methods may be used. This auction website may offer an additional service to buyer and seller to verify the pods for authenticity, non-tampering of pod, no air leak of the pod; etc. The pods 14 will be sold with optimized preparation recipes encoded (explained more below in the machine section). However, the consumer may choose to experiment with process parameters to suite individual taste. The user may decide to upload their personal recipe for a specific pod type to the website for free access by all, or may choose to upload the recipe and charge others for access. The website would handle the transaction and take a percentage of sale price for facilitating transaction. Along similar lines, there may be chefs, celebrities, or others who may wish to create branded recipes specific to each type of pod 14 . The website would facilitate the exchange and/or sale of these recipes (e.g., a Wolfgang Puck recipe for Guatemalan Finca bean, an Usain Bolt recipe for Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, etc.). This could be considered an analogy to how app stores have evolved for software on mobile phones except in this case it is an ‘app store’ for recipes for coffee preparation. Coffee Preparation Machine Embodiments The coffee preparation machine 16 is a key to the inventions described above and all the pieces described work together. Here we describe the inventions in coffee preparation enabled by the new coffee machine 16 . Coffee preparation involves three keys steps: 1) roast green beans, 2) grind beans, 3) brew coffee. In all previous cases, roasting is done separately from grinding and brewing. Coffee machines exist on the market that brew coffee from ground coffee, coffee machines exist that grind roasted beans and brew coffee, and coffee machines exist that brew single serve coffee from coffee grounds packaged in pods, however, all of these machines require roasted coffee beans that have been roasted separately as mentioned previously. Here we describe for the first time a coffee machine 16 that encompasses roasting, grinding, and brewing in a single machine. The green coffee beans for this machine 16 are provided to the machine 16 in a standardized single serve pod 14 described above. Thus this machine 16 is a single serve roast/grind/brew machine that provides the user control over every step of the coffee preparation process and the freshest coffee ever made. Typically roasting of coffee beans is performed on large scale machines and can take up to 10-20 minutes per batch. Here, we describe technology to enable fast roasting of green beans in small quantity in less than three minutes so that the user does not have to wait a long time for coffee. We believe that delivering the ultimate cup of coffee to the consumer in a few minutes is key to enabling a viable machine since the user would not wait the 10-20 minute roast time of traditional roasting to get a cup of coffee. The features of this machine are novel and describe a new invention in the coffee industry. This machine 16 may be used in any number of professional/restaurant settings or may be used in the home. Roasting Process The traditional sequence of coffee making is to roast green beans, grind beans, and brew coffee. An alternative approach is to grind the green beans, roast the ground beans, and brew coffee. This alternative sequence is not done in any coffee making machine and thus is novel. The purpose of the alternative approach is that the green beans are ground to a small size, which results in more surface area exposed to heat during roasting and enabling faster, more uniform, heat transfer throughout the green bean particles. This allows more uniform roasting and faster roasting, both of which are desirable. Variations on this concept can include 1) coarse grind green coffee beans, 2) roast coarse grind beans, 3) fine grind the roasted particles, 4) brew coffee. Other slight variations in this sequence should be considered part of the novelty we suggest. Typically the three steps in making coffee mentioned above (roast, grind, brew) are done as three separate discrete steps. However, we propose a novel concept of partial or complete overlapping of these steps in time or space to reduce the total time required to make coffee. For example, the roasting and grinding may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may begin as some beans are roasted. Another example is that grinding and brewing may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may occur in a wet grind process which initiates the brewing process. Other variations of combining process steps can occur and we consider the concept of combining process steps in a single coffee making machine to be novel. The machine, such as machine 16 shown in FIG. 10, may have an array of sensors 18 built in to measure process parameters along with feedback control systems to optimize the performance of each step the machine 16 performs (i.e., roast, grind, brew). For roasting such sensors may include a camera/color sensor to determine color change of beans during roasting, a humidity/water sensor to measure the water content in a roasting chamber 30 , a humidity sensor for ambient local air, a carbon dioxide sensor to measure CO2 emission during roasting, an optical spectroscopy system to measure chemical emissions during roasting, a temperature and time measurement along with roast profile control, and a microphone sensor to listen for first crack of the beans, second crack of the beans, and other noise emissions during roasting. For grinding, sensors 218 may include optical sensors to visually monitor grind size, use of a vibration sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) to monitor progress of grinding, a microphone to measure noise from grinder to determine grind size, etc. Since the grind process makes audible noise, it may be possible to use active noise canceling techniques along with an embedded audio speaker to mute or minimize the noise generated by the grinder 40 . For the brewing system 50 , sensors may include, a water temperature sensor, a water pressure sensor, a water pH sensor, an optical absorption sensor, an optical light scattering sensor, an optical polarization sensor to measure coffee extraction from the grind, a refractometer to measure coffee extraction, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors to measure other chemical parameters of brewing, and other chemical sensors. The use of such sensors integrated into a coffee making machine for monitoring and feedback control is novel. One of the key functions of the machine is the roasting of coffee beans in single serve portions with the green coffee beans provided in small pods. The roasting must happen quickly in order for the consumer to enjoy a cup of coffee within a few minutes. Traditional coffee bean roasting has been performed in large batches on industrial scale machines where roasting can take 10-20 minutes per batch, or in large industrial machines where the machine is continuously in operation and pre-heated to a high temperature such that roasting can be performed in a shorter time period. In both of these cases, these are large industrial machines that roast quantities from many pounds to thousands of pounds of green beans. The key difference here is that we need to rapidly roast a small quantity of green coffee beans (up to a 50 grams in weight) within a few minutes. This type of roasting machine is not currently made since we need very fast heat up time from the moment the user initiates the machine to make coffee. Roasting of coffee beans is typically done between 200 C to 300 C (and up to 500 C in some cases). Thus the roaster (e.g., roasting system 30 shown in FIG. 10) must rapidly rise in temperature from ambient temperature of approximately 20 C to several hundred degrees Celsius in a precisely controlled manner. Here we suggest ultrafast heater temperature increase ramp rate that can be in the range 1 to 10 C/second, 11 to 50 C/sec, 51 to 100 C/sec, 101 to 200 C/sec, or 201 C/sec and higher. Likewise at the end of roasting, the temperature must be rapidly cooled and thus the temperature decrease ramp rate can be in the range 1 to 10 C/second, 11 to 50 C/sec, 51 to 100 C/sec, 101 to 200 C/sec, etc. The overall time for roasting may be in the range of 1 to 30 seconds, 31 to 60 seconds, 61 to 90 seconds, 91 to 120 seconds, 121 to 300 seconds, etc. As described below, a rapid heating method is needed to roast the beans and this heat can be applied by convective, conductive, or radiation means. Thus the roasting portion of the entire machine is novel in that the quantity of beans and the speed of roasting is different from what is done currently. In order to roast beans quickly, we need a fast heating method that enables rapid temperature rise of the bean. Conventional ovens use electrical resistor heating elements that heat the air in the chamber, and this air then heats the sample in question through convective heating. A direct approach to heating is to use laser 12 (FIG. 1) heating. In laser heating of green coffee beans, a laser of specific wavelength, spot size, and power level is directed via an optical system to the green coffee beans 10 , which absorb the radiation and heat up. We have demonstrated that laser heating of green coffee beans can be used to rapidly roast green coffee beans. The use of a laser 12 allows direct heating of the bean 10 without heating up the air or other space around the bean 10 . Also, this approach allows very precise delivery of heat to the bean 10 since the heat source can be removed when the laser 12 is turned off or blocked. The laser 12 can be operated in continuous mode, pulsed mode or some sequential combination of these modes to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize bean 10 roasting (FIG. 2). This is a novel invention in that using lasers to rapidly roast green coffee beans has not been done before. The beans 10 may be agitated mechanically or with air to move them into the path of the laser beam. The laser beam delivery system may be mounted on a mechanical system 22 to move the beam across the array of coffee beans 10 that need to be roasted. Optical systems may be used to distribute the laser light uniformly upon the beans, or may be used to create a desired illumination profile across the coffee beans. The laser 12 used for illumination may be a diode laser, a diode laser single emitter, an array of diode laser single emitters, a diode laser bar, or diode laser stack of bars as desired. The laser diodes may operate in the visible wavelength range, the near infrared wavelength range, or other infrared wavelength range. The wavelength of operation may be chosen to correspond with specific spectral absorption features of the coffee bean 10 . A benefit of operating in the near infrared wavelength range is the commercial availability of high power laser diodes that have been developed for solid state laser pumping. The roasting may also be done using a combination of heating methods including laser radiation method along with convective resistive heating. In another embodiment of optical heating methods, a light emitting diode (LED) may be used instead of the laser light source with an appropriate optical system to direct the light from LED to the coffee beans. In another embodiment, microwave energy may be used to rapidly heat and roast the beans (e.g., a microwave oven). As shown in FIGS. 3-7, another approach to roasting green coffee beans is again to use radiation heating. In this case, we can use infrared or visible wavelength emission lamps 24 as the heating element. The green coffee beans absorb the radiated light from the bulb and heat up until roasted (the bulb may emit in the visible wavelength range, infrared wavelength range or some bands of wavelengths deemed desirable such as MIR, FIR, etc.). The use of a lamp 24 allows fast roasting and direct heating of the green coffee bean 10 within a transparent tube 11 and is a novel invention. The lamp 24 can be operated in continuous, pulsed, or some combination of these modes, to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize bean roasting. Lamps 24 emit light in multiple directions and some emitted light may not hit the beans. Thus to efficiently use the optical energy, it may be preferable to use optical cavity designs 26 to collect and direct the emitted light to the target coffee beans. Such optical cavity designs may include elliptical reflective cavities, multi-ellipse cavities, circular reflective cavities, etc. A number of cavity designs have been proposed in the lamp pumped laser industry that direct pump laser light to the absorbing laser rod. These cavity designs can be applied to roasting coffee whereby the laser rod is replaced with a glass tube containing coffee beans. Cross section diagrams of these geometries are shown in FIG. 3-7. It is a novel invention to use optical cavities 26 to capture and direct light to coffee beans for rapid roasting. The optical cavity 26 may also be designed to illuminate the beans 10 with a desired intensity profile for specific roasting as desired. The roasting may also be done using a combination of heating methods including lamp radiation method along with convective resistive heating. Though we have shown several cavity designs 26 , there are other cavity designs that may be used that capture and direct light to a focal spot while also homogenizing the focal spot light intensity. After roasting of coffee beans, it may be desirable to rapidly quench the beans 10 (i.e., rapidly cool down the beans) to stop the ongoing processes in the bean due to latent heat inside the bean. This may be done in one of several ways including water immersion quenching or forced air quenching. In particular, grinding the beans into small particles immediately after roasting increases surface area. Thus quickly grinding the beans and flowing air or water through the grinds quenches the bean from continuing to roast. In addition, the water used to brew the coffee serves also to quench the heat of the beans since the water used for brewing will be just under 100 Celsius in contrast to the several hundred degree Celsius roast temperature. During roasting of green coffee beans, the color of the beans changes from green to dark brown/black depending on the length of time roasted (a longer time gives a darker color). Traditionally, these roast types and colors are denoted coarsely as cinnamon/New England; city/full city; Vienna; espresso; Italian; French. In our approach to roasting, the use of quantitative measurements and methods such as precision imaging and signal processing will allow us to denote a much finer gradation in roast progress and thus much finer taste control. As the beans are roasted, some smoke may be emitted and chaff is released from the outside skin of the bean. The machine 16 may capture the smoke and may capture the chaff. During the roasting process the beans emit a defined popping sound at different times during roasting known as first crack and second crack. These sounds are indicative of roasting process and audio monitoring of this sound with feedback control may be used to optimize roasting. During roasting, the beans emit an aroma that is pleasant to many people and a desirable trait to smell. The machine may have features to capture and disperse this aroma outside of the machine into the local environment for the pleasure of the consumer. In another variation, the machine may capture the aroma scent into a small container or other device that can be opened later to release the aroma as desired by the user (or the aroma containment system could be attached to a coffee cup with aroma released in a time release manner). The machine 16 would be able to roast, grind, and brew, as mentioned above. Since the roasting process requires heat, it may be possible to recover extra waste heat from this process to heat or pre-heat the water needed for the brewing process. As one example, water may passed over the hot beans after roasting which serves to quench the beans and heat the water (but not limited to this method only). This is a novel approach to energy efficiency within the coffee machine and a new invention. Roasting of beans 10 may also be done on an individual basis to optimize taste. This is a novel concept that has never been done before in coffee making since roasting has traditionally been a large industrial process. The quantity of green beans needed for a single cup of coffee may range from 50 to 500 beans. For this discussion we use 100 beans to simplify the discussion, but the concepts apply to any number of beans. When using a radiative light based heating system (e.g., laser, LEDs, lamp, etc.), the beans may be aligned in a pattern with a corresponding pattern of illumination sources (this may be a 1:1 mapping, or N:M mapping of sources to beans). An optical system may be used between the sources and beans such that each bean is illuminated by one light source with the desired illumination pattern. Each light source may have individual power control or sub-arrays of the light source may have a single power control. By using a 1:1 mapping of light sources to beans, each bean may now be illuminated and heated with individual control. A camera may be used to image the color of the beans and along with image processing algorithms used to feedback individual power adjustment control to the individual light sources to optimize roasting (a wavelength selective filter may be placed in front of the camera to filter out the light used to roast the beans). This may mean roasting all beans to exactly the same degree of roast (e.g., color of roast) or it may mean creating a ‘roast blend’ where some beans are roasted to a different degree purposefully to get a desired taste profile in the final beverage (as an alternative, for the lamp based system, several separate cavities may be created with each cavity containing a subset of beans and each lamp can be controlled separately based on feedback sensors to optimize roast within that cavity). The beans from the several cavities are mixed before grinding. It may be possible to use an array of small resistive heating elements with each element in contact with one bean as an alternative to a light based heating system. In any of these cases, this is a completely novel invention to individually control roasting of coffee beans. The machine 16 would automate handling of the beans to move them from stage to stage of processing as needed. For example, moving between roasting and grinding, or moving between grinding and brewing. This may be considered as a robotic handling method that is new in a coffee machine. The machine 16 would have a receptacle for accepting the coffee pod 14 . The pod would be sealed but the machine 16 would have a method for automatically opening the pod 14 and dispensing the contents as needed to the first stage of processing. Grind Embodiments The machine 16 would have a grinding stage 40 where the roasted beans are ground into fine particles. The average particle size may vary between 50 microns to 2000 microns. The electrically powered grinder would be adjustable to a desired particle size. The grinder may be a blade grinder 29 , burr grinder 28 (e.g., a disc burr grinder, conical burr grinder, etc.), or any other grinder. A grinder that produces a uniform particle size is desirable. The time taken for grinding may be 1 to 10 seconds, 11 to 30 seconds, 31 to 60 seconds, 61 to 120 seconds, or 121 seconds and greater. After the roasting stage, the machine automatically moves the beans from the roasting stage to the proper location for grinding. After grinding, the machine automatically moves the beans to the proper location for brewing. The time taken to move between stages may be less than or equal to 1 second, 1.01 to 10 seconds, 10.01 to 45 seconds, etc. Brewing Embodiments After grinding, the ground particles are moved into the brewing stage 50 . Coffee brewing is performed by passing heated water through the grounds which extracts the coffee into the liquid. The machine would have a rapid water heating system 32 to quickly bring water to the proper temperature. The water temperature may be brought to boiling (212 F), or some other temperature range such as 150 to 160 F, 161 to 175 F, 176 to 195 F, 196 to 211 F, etc. A water temperature in the range of 195 to 205 F is considered to be desirable for brewing coffee. The coffee grounds may be placed in a chamber with a filter at the bottom of the chamber and the filter may be paper or metallic. The coffee grounds may be tamped or compressed by the machine 16 as desired. The pressure of compression may be varied by the machine 16 as desired. The water may be injected into this chamber at high pressure. The water pressure may range from 0.1 bar to 18 bar depending on the coffee type (e.g., coffee, espresso, etc.) desired and the desired taste of coffee. A refractometer or other sensors may built into the coffee machine to provide real time measurement and feedback control of various brew parameters to optimize coffee taste. The time required to brew coffee would ideally be <1 minute. The amount of water used in making the cup of coffee may be any amount from 0.1 ounces to 20 ounces. The brewing time may be <1 second, 1.01 to 30 seconds, 30.01 to 60 seconds, or 60.01 seconds or longer. In an alternative brewing method, the water may be poured on top of the coffee grounds and mixed with the grounds. The coffee liquid may then be ‘sucked’ out of the chamber with a vacuum system 34 . The coffee grounds would remain in the chamber separate from the coffee liquid due to a filter that does not allow the coffee grounds to pass. The total time for making a cup of coffee with this machine from the time the user initiates operation may be <30 seconds (e.g. method 100 as shown in FIG. 11), 30.01 to 60 seconds, 60.01 to 120 seconds, 120.01 to 180 seconds, 180.01 to 300 seconds (e.g., method 200 shown in FIG. 12), or 300.01 seconds or greater. As mentioned earlier, it is desirable that the coffee making machine make the cup of coffee as fast as possible while maintaining highest quality. The machine would dispense the coffee into a coffee cup. Additional Embodiments The machine 16 may have the capability to infuse 36 flavors and/or nutrients/vitamins into the final beverage. At stages after roasting, the machine may inject flavors (e.g., chocolate, hazelnut, etc.) or nutrients (e.g., vitamins, antioxidants, etc.) into the mixture such that this material is retained in subsequent steps and remains in the final beverage. The machine 16 may have an internet connection either through wired or wireless means. This internet connection would enable the features described above. In particular, the machine 16 would be able to interact with central servers to upload and download information about beans, optimized recipes for preparation, initiating coffee preparation from remote or local mobile devices, mobile apps, etc. One purpose of the many controls used in this machine 16 is to optimize the taste of the beverage for the final consumer to their specific desires. The taste sensors (taste buds) on each person's tongue are unique and different and cause individuals to respond differently to the same preparation. Thus, we envision the possibility of a method to determine the variation in taste sensors on a person's tongue and using that information to optimize the coffee making process to that individual. This effectively requires a sensor system that can map and ‘taste’ the corresponding taste sensors on the tongue, which can be done optically, spectroscopically, or through chemical sensors that map the tongue. This information could then be transmitted to the coffee machine 16 and algorithms optimize coffee preparation for that person's tongue. In another application of using lasers to assist in the coffee making process, the coffee beans could have small holes drilled through the bean using a laser. High pressure water could be injected through these holes to fracture the bean (e.g. bean fracking) into small particles and thus replace traditional grinding. Additionally it may be possible to inject hot water or steam into the small holes and use this to brew or extract the coffee from the bean in a new way (eg ‘in bean brewing’). The steam passes thru the beans and is condensed to form the beverage. Another way to make coffee using a coffee pod system is to perform all functions of roast, grind brew within the pod itself. The pod with green coffee beans may contain resistive heater elements that mate to current sources in the machine to roast coffee. Or the pod may be transparent to allow optical energy provided by the machine to impinge upon the beans and roast the beans. The machine may break the seal of the pod or puncture the pod as needed during these steps. Another approach to grinding is to apply sonic energy to the roasted beans to cause the beans to fracture into small particles; and/or high pressure water may be applied to the beans to cause them to fracture. Water may be injected into the pod in order to brew the coffee.","20170360242"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coffee beverages contain chlorogenic acids, a kind of polyphenol, such as chlorogenic acid, coffeic acid and ferulic acid. The chlorogenic acids are reported to have excellent physiological activities such as an hypotensive effect. Increasing the ingestion of chlorogenic acids is efficient to allow the physiological activities to be sufficiently exhibit. Green coffee beans contain a large amount of chlorogenic acids; however, coffee beverages obtained from green coffee beans do not have the proper coffee taste and flavor. In contrast, coffee beverages obtained from roasted coffee beans have good coffee taste and flavor; however, an amount of chlorogenic acids is reduced by roasting. Therefore, as a coffee product which contains chlorogenic acids at a high concentration and has good coffee taste and flavor, for example, proposed is a coffee product obtained by grinding a mixture containing green coffee beans and roasted coffee beans in a predetermined ratio, and then subjecting the mixture to extraction and drying (Patent Document 1). Furthermore, proposed is a packaged coffee beverage, in which coffee extracts obtained from dark roasted coffee beans and light roasted coffee beans are mixed and the ratio of chlorogenic acids to tannin and the ratio of dichlorogenic acids to chlorogenic acids are controlled to fall within specific ranges (Patent Document 2). Moreover, a process for producing coffee beans reduced in the content of hydroxyhydroquinone, which inhibits the hypotensive effect of chlorogenic acids, is proposed (Patent Document 3). CITATION LIST Patent Document [Patent Document 1] JP-A-2008-535506 [Patent Document 2] JP-B-4012560 [Patent Document 3] JP-A-2008-048728 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for producing roasted coffee beans, comprising placing starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value of from 21 to 50 in an airtight container and subjecting the roasted coffee beans to a heat treatment at from 100 to 160° C. The present invention also provides roasted coffee beans having an L value of more than 20 to 38 or less, (A) a content of hydroquinone of 7.1 mg or more per kg of the roasted coffee beans, and (B) a content of hydroxyhydroquinone of 50 mg or less per kg of the roasted coffee beans. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Coffee taste and flavor include, e.g., acidity, bitterness and sweetness. The coffee taste and flavor is brought from a balance between these tastes, and characterized by roasted coffee beans used in production. The present inventor conducted studies. As a result, he found that in a coffee beverage prepared by using dark roasted coffee beans and green coffee beans, or dark roasted coffee beans and light roasted coffee beans, as described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, the blending and processing conditions need to be limited to some extent in order to satisfy both taste and flavor and stability during storage, and that if green coffee beans or light roasted coffee beans are used in predetermined amount or more, it gives an uncomfortable feeling to aftertaste. Then, the present inventor conducted more specific studies. As a result, he found that the uncomfortable aftertaste is attributed to unpleasant taste brought when green coffee beans and light roasted coffee beans are used in production. Herein, the “unpleasant taste” used in the specification refers to foreign taste remaining after drinking and disrupting the taste and flavor balance intrinsic to roasted coffee beans. The present invention provides roasted coffee beans, which are useful as a starting material for a coffee beverage suppressed in unpleasant taste and have a roast degree within a predetermined level or less, and a process for producing the same. The present inventor, based on the hypothesis that any component in light roasted coffee beans involves with unpleasant taste, produced roasted coffee beans by subjecting light roasted coffee beans as a starting material to various treatments and analyzed them. As a result, he found that unpleasant taste is suppressed by applying a heat treatment within a specific temperature range. The present inventor analyzed components of the roasted coffee beans based on these findings. As a result, he found that it is effective to control the amounts of hydroquinone and hydroxyhydroquinone in light roasted coffee beans to obtain a coffee beverage suppressed in unpleasant taste attributed to light roasted coffee beans, and accomplished the present invention. According to the present invention, it is possible to provide roasted coffee beans, which are useful as a starting material for a coffee beverage suppressed in unpleasant taste and have a roast degree suppressed within a predetermined level or less. The roasted coffee beans of the present invention contain chlorogenic acids at a high concentration and can be suitably used as roasted coffee beans for enhancing the amount of chlorogenic acids in a blend coffee beverage. Furthermore, according to the present invention, it is possible to efficiently produce such roasted coffee beans in a simple operation. First, a process for producing the roasted coffee beans of the present invention will be described. The starting material roasted coffee beans to be used in the present invention are light roasted coffee beans having an L value of from 21 to 50. In view of suppressing unpleasant taste, the upper limit of the L value is preferably 48 and more preferably 46; whereas the lower limit thereof is preferably 22, more preferably 25, more preferably 30 and more preferably 31 and even more preferably 33. The range of the L value of the starting material roasted coffee beans is preferably from 22 to 50, more preferably from 25 to 50, more preferably from 30 to 50, more preferably from 30 to 48, more preferably from 31 to 48, more preferably from 31 to 46 and even more preferably from 33 to 46. Herein the “L value” in the specification is defined as a lightness value of roasted coffee beans measured by a color difference meter, provided that the L value of black is regarded as 0 and the L value of white is regarded as 100. The starting material roasted coffee beans may be used singly or in a mixture of two or more. In the present invention, two or more of coffee beans different in roast degree may be used as a mixture. When two or more of coffee beans different in roast degree are used as a mixture, the L value of the starting material roasted coffee beans is determined by multiplying the L value of each of the roasted coffee beans by its content ratio and then summing up the resulting product. Furthermore, if the L value of the starting material roasted coffee beans thus calculated falls within the above range, roasted coffee beans having a roast degree outside the above range may be used. As the starting material roasted coffee beans, roasted green coffee beans or commercially available product may be used. A method of roasting coffee beans is not particularly limited and a known method may be appropriately selected. For example, the roasting temperature is preferably from 180 to 300° C., more preferably from 190 to 280° C. and even more preferably from 200 to 280° C. The heating time may be appropriately set so as to obtain a desired roast degree. Furthermore, examples of roasters which may be used include a roaster for roasting beans kept unmoved, a roaster for roasting beans while transferring and a roaster for roasting beans while stirring or the like. More specifically, a shelf dryer, a conveyer dryer, a rotary-drum dryer and a rotary V-type dryer or the like are mentioned. As a heating system, a direct heating system, a hot-air system, a half-hot air system, a far-infrared ray system, an infrared ray system, a microwave system, a superheated steam system or the like are mentioned. Furthermore, the kind of coffee beans is not particularly limited, for example, Coffea Arabica, Coffea Robusta and Coffea Liberica and the like are mentioned. Furthermore, the production region of coffee beans, for example, includes Brazil, Colombia, Tanzania, Mocha, Kilimanjaro, Mandheling, Blue Mountain and Guatemala and the like. These coffee beans may be used singly or as a blend of a plurality of kinds. Furthermore, the starting material roasted coffee beans may be ground or not ground. The size of ground starting material roasted coffee beans may be appropriately selected; however, the roasted coffee beans which pass through a 12-mesh Tyler standard sieve and do not pass through a 115-mesh Tyler standard sieve are preferable. In the present invention, as the starting material roasted coffee beans, roasted coffee beans having an L value higher than a desired L value are used. For example, starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value larger by 5 to 10 than a desired L value is preferably selected. More specifically, when roasted coffee beans having an L value of about 30 are desired, starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value of 35 to 40 are preferably used. The L value of the roasted coffee beans produced by the present invention is preferably more than 20 and 38 or less. In view of suppressing unpleasant taste, the upper limit thereof is preferably 35, more preferably 33 and even more preferably 31; whereas the lower limit thereof is preferably 20.1, more preferably 20.5, more preferably 26 and even more preferably 28. As the range of the L value of the roasted coffee beans produced, it is preferably from 20.1 to 38, more preferably from 20.2 to 38, more preferably from 20.5 to 38, more preferably from 25 to 38, more preferably from 26 to 35, more preferably from 26 to 33, more preferably from 28 to 33 and even more preferably from 28 to 31. Furthermore, in the present invention, starting material roasted coffee beans are subjected to a heat treatment with being placed in an airtight container. In this manner, it is possible to increase the amount of (A) hydroquinone and decrease the amount of (B) hydroxyhydroquinone while maintaining the amount of (C) chlorogenic acids. The airtight container is not particularly limited as long as it shuts out contact with an ambient air. Examples thereof include a retort pouch, a can and a bottle. Furthermore, the shape and material of the airtight container is not particularly limited. When a heat treatment is performed by use of an autoclave described later, a pressure-resistant container is preferably used. The internal volume of the airtight container is usually from 2 to 30 times and preferably from 3 to 20 times as large as the bulk volume of starting material roasted coffee beans; however, the internal volume may be appropriately set, depending on the L value of the starting material roasted coffee beans to be used. For example, when starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value of from 30 to 50 are used, the ratio of the internal volume of an airtight container relative to the bulk volume of the starting material roasted coffee beans is usually from 2 to 30 times, preferably from 3 to 20 times and even more preferably from 4 to 10 times. The conditions are suitable for producing roasted coffee beans having an L value of from 25 to 38 (hereinafter also referred to as a “first roasted coffee beans”). Furthermore, when starting material roasted coffee beans having an L value of 21 or more and less than 30 are used, the ratio of the internal volume of the airtight container relative to the bulk volume of the starting material roasted coffee beans is usually from 2 to 30 times, preferably from 4 to 25 times, more preferably from 5 to 20 times and even more preferably more than 10 times to 20 times or less. The conditions are suitable for producing roasted coffee beans having an L value of more than 20 and less than 25 (hereinafter also referred to as a “second roasted coffee beans”). As described above, as the airtight container, an airtight container having a predetermined spatial volume in the container when starting material roasted coffee beans are placed is suitably used. Presence of oxygen in the airtight container before a heat treatment is preferable, and atmospheric air is more preferable. The heating temperature is from 100 to 160° C. The upper limit thereof is preferably 155° C., more preferably 150° C., more preferably 145° C. and even more preferably 140° C.; whereas, the lower limit thereof is preferably 110° C., more preferably 115° C. and even more preferably 120° C.

As the heating apparatus, for example, an autoclave or a drier to which heat can be applied may be used. For the atmosphere during heating, either atmospheric air or an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen may be employed. The heating time is preferably from 0.5 to 4 hours, more preferably from 1 to 3 hours and even more preferably 1 to 2 hours. The heating time herein is specified as the lapse time after an airtight container is charged into a heating apparatus in the case where the heating apparatus is previously heated to a desired temperature. Alternatively, in the case where the temperature is raised after an airtight container is charged into the heating apparatus, the heating time is specified as the lapse time after the temperature of the heating apparatus reaches to a desired temperature. The heat treatment may be carried out under a normal pressure or an elevated pressure.

After cooling, roasted coffee beans are taken out from the airtight container to obtain the roasted coffee beans of the present invention.

TECHNICAL FIELD Embodiments of the technology relate, in general, to coffee roasting, grinding, or brewing technology, and in particular to integrated roasting, grinding, or brewing coffee systems operable by a consumer. BACKGROUND Coffee has traditionally been made using a three step process that generally includes the roasting of coffee beans, grinding of roasted beans, and brewing of the ground beans in hot water to extract the flavor into a beverage. These three steps are traditionally done at different times and locations. Roasting is typically done in large industrial machines in large batches of tens of pounds to thousands of pounds at a time. Roasted beans or ground roasted beans are generally shipped to local retailers, which can take weeks to months before the package arrives for the consumer to brew. The consumer can be the retail home consumer or businesses, such as coffee shops, that brew and sell coffee. Roasted beans decay in freshness and taste from the moment the roast is completed as chemical compounds formed in the bean during the roasting process deteriorate. The decay of roasted beans may lead to the coffee having a less desirable taste. Coffee produced by such methods may be stale due to the time delay from roasting to brewing. The preparation of coffee generally involves the steps of roasting, grinding, and brewing. In current systems, roasting is generally performed at a separate location and performed days, weeks, or months prior to grinding and brewing. The taste of coffee is generally determined by the type of coffee beans used and by numerous process parameters in each step of making the coffee beverage. A key set of chemical reactions that influence coffee taste occur during the roasting process. The roasting process is typically done in an industrial batch scale, and the end consumer has no control over the roast process or the taste of the coffee beverage as determined by the bean roast. Additionally, the degree of roasting for each bean type can transform the taste of the final coffee beverage to an individual consumer's liking, yet this degree of control by the consumer does not exist in the coffee industry today.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference throughout the specification to “various embodiments,” “some embodiments,” “one embodiment,” “some example embodiments,” “one example embodiment,” or “an embodiment” means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with any embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases “in various embodiments,” “in some embodiments,” “in one embodiment,” “some example embodiments,” “one example embodiment,” or “in an embodiment” in places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. Systems and methods described herein can integrate roasting, grinding and brewing of coffee into a single machine, where customers can precisely adjust the coffee at each stage of the process to suit their preferences. Example embodiments can include providing unroasted green coffee beans in single serve pods, which can eliminate the need for high cost bulk roasting and the accompanying higher consumer cost. Such a system may create a new market for green unroasted coffee beans. Example embodiments described herein can use an integrated coffee system to produce a cup of coffee from unroasted whole beans in less than 2 minutes, in less than five minutes, or at any suitable speed or time duration. Various non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, and use of the apparatuses, systems, methods, and processes disclosed herein. One or more examples of these non-limiting embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that systems and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting embodiments. The features illustrated or described in connection with one non-limiting embodiment may be combined with the features of other non-limiting embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure. Described herein are example embodiments of apparatuses, systems, and methods for an integrated beverage grinding, brewing, and/or roasting system. In an example embodiment, packaging for coffee is disclosed that can maintain the freshness of the bean while allowing easy distribution and verification of bean authenticity. In an example embodiment, an integrated coffee system can grind, roast, and brew coffee within a single system. In some embodiments, the integrated coffee system can be configured to accept unroasted coffee beans in single-serving packages. In some embodiments, the integrated coffee system can be configured to accept ground, unroasted coffee beans for roasting and brewing within an integrated coffee system. The examples discussed herein are examples only and are provided to assist in the explanation of the apparatuses, devices, systems and methods described herein. None of the features or components shown in the drawings or discussed below should be taken as mandatory for any specific implementation of any of these apparatuses, devices, systems or methods unless specifically designated as mandatory. For ease of reading and clarity, certain components, modules, or methods may be described solely in connection with a specific figure.

Method 100 can be performed at least partially by the interactive beverage system 10 or the integrated beverage system 12 . It will be appreciated that any suitable steps of the method 100 can be performed by the integrated beverage system 12 or can be performed independently from the integrated beverage system 12 . In an example embodiment, the method 100 can be performed with an integrated beverage system 400 depicted in FIG. 5. Long preparation times may delay customer consumption of coffee and customers may seek other options if preparation time is too long. Traditional coffee roasting can be a time consuming process that can take 10 to 20 minutes for the roasting to occur and the full batch process time can exceed 30 minutes. This length of time may be too long for the consumer to wait for coffee preparation. Methods, apparatuses, and systems described herein can rapidly roast, grind, and/or brew coffee such that the entire preparation process can be performed automatically in less than one minute, in about 1 to about 2 minutes, in about 2 to about 3 minutes, in about 3 to about 5 minutes, in about 5 to about 7 minutes. These time ranges for coffee preparation are within the ranges acceptable for a consumer to wait while providing an entirely new coffee drinking experience to the consumer. It will be appreciated that systems, devices, or tools associated with the integrated coffee system 12 , including grinding, roasting, or brewing tools or systems, can be engaged with, associated with, coupled with, can interact with, can be operable to work with, or can otherwise be used with coffee beans or coffee grounds. The method 100 can include the step of Bean Marking 102 . Coffee has evolved in recent years from a widespread commodity product with ‘generic’ tasting coffee products to specialty coffee where specific beans, origin location, microclimates, growing conditions, year of production, and processing conditions are tracked and marketed. These variations in the source beans can affect the taste of the coffee beverage and thus can be tracked and marketed to a final consumer. Coffee has many aromatic compounds that affect aroma and taste and coffee contains more aromatic compounds than wine. Coffee can be marketed by region, year of packaging, vineyard, year of harvest, time of year harvested, plantation or farm, type of bean, elevation, time of day sun hits the coffee plant, microclimate, bean processing, picking method, de-pulping, drying, dry process, wet process, shipping and storage method, exact weather conditions at the source during the growing season, satellite weather data, or by any other suitable parameter or characteristic. In an example embodiment, providing an unroasted product to a consumer may help retain the characteristics of the bean, where such a model may be attractive to consumers. The step of Bean Marking 102 can provide assurance to the end consumer that the product, such as unroasted green coffee beans, being purchased is genuine and not counterfeit. This can allow the consumer to verify the authenticity of the purchase and to possibly sell that product in the future for value that may increase or decrease. Coffee plants are grown in approximately 50 countries worldwide typically in the tropical regions of the world at high elevations. The coffee cherry is generally picked from the plant and after several process steps, dried green coffee beans are produced. These beans can vary widely in quality and taste leading to a large difference in price. Commodity green coffee beans may be priced significantly lower than specialty green coffee beans, which may have a specific taste and origin. However it may be difficult for a person to determine the origin of a green coffee bean by physical observation and thus expensive beans may be easily counterfeited. The step of Bean Marking 102 can include laser marking, mechanical marking, or any other suitable system or mechanism for determining, indicating, or validating the type, origin, age, or the like, for a coffee bean. Referring to FIG. 10, one example of a coffee bean 900 is illustrated having a marking 902 . It will be appreciated that the marking 902 can be placed on any suitable region of the coffee bean 900 and can have any suitable size, shape, or configuration. Laser marking can be applied to individual coffee beans with a custom code, regional code, or the like, that may be difficult or impossible to copy. The marking instrument can include a diode laser, fiber laser, CO2 laser, or any other suitable type of laser. Laser marking can include short pulse, high peak power lasers that can minimize heat damage to surrounding areas of the green bean outside where the beam hits. Penetration depth of the laser can be varied and can depend on wavelength and peak power, where it may be advantageous to minimize penetration depth such that the inside of the bean remains substantially unharmed. The curved side or the flat side of a bean can be marked. In an example embodiment, the surface of bean can be marked without damage or with minimal damage to the inside of the bean. Mechanical marking of the surface of a coffee bean with a specific code, for example, can also be performed without damaging the inside of the bean using, for example, a blade or a stamp. Bean Marking 102 can include the application of visual marking material to a coffee bean in, for example, a custom pattern. Example markings can include fluorescent materials that can emit only when stimulated with the proper external optical stimulus. These materials can be organic (e.g., green fluorescent protein or other materials) or inorganic. Biologically safe materials and materials that can burn off during coffee roasting can be used to leave no trace in appearance or taste. It will be appreciated that the step of Bean Marking 102 can be performed at any suitable location or time including, for example, at a coffee farm or processing plant prior to the coffee beans being packaged or shipped to consumers. Still referring to FIG. 2, the method 100 can include the step of Bean Verification 104 . Consumers may wish to validate characteristics of coffee beans, such as origin, age, type, or the like. In an example embodiment, Bean Verification 104 can include mechanically, electronically, optically, or manually reviewing the imprint, code, or the like associated with the Bean Marking step 102 . For example, a warehouse receiving beans from around the world can be equipped to electronically read and/or record the imprint, code, or indicia on the beans to confirm the authenticity of each bean. Additionally, or alternatively, the integrated coffee system 12 can be equipped to read the imprint, code, or the like associated with coffee beans to confirm authenticity. In one embodiment, the scanned or otherwise recorded information can be compared by an integrated coffee system 12 against data in the database server 18 (FIG. 1) to determine coffee bean authenticity. Bean Verification 104 can include DNA verification, where DNA sequencing of beans can be performed on reference bean samples from desired locations. Bean Verification 104 can be performed at any stage during the method 100 and can be performed at a farm, warehouse, distribution site, or by the integrated beverage system 12 . DNA sequence data can be stored, such as in the database server 18 , and compared to DNA sequence data of coffee beans at a later date to verify origin of the bean. In an example embodiment, bean roasting can occur just prior to consumption, where Bean Marking 102 and Bean Verification 104 can be combined with any other suitable anti-counterfeiting method or system to maintain the integrity and reliability of coffee beans through the distribution chain until the final preparation. Delaying roasting until just prior to preparation may help maintain the integrity of markings and DNA associated with Bean Marking 102 and Bean Verification 104 . Bean Verification 104 can include any suitable evaluation of parameters to validate the origin or terroir of coffee beans, including characteristics of the geography, geology and climate of certain places, which may affect coffee taste. Food provenancing, which is the chronology of the ownership or location of a historical object, can be applied to coffee beans just as it is frequently applied to other foods and beverages such as wine. Bean Verification 104 can include using spectroscopic methods to verify provenance of coffee beans by measuring spectroscopic data (e.g., molecular compounds, ratios of different elements, etc.) from regions, locations, climates, etc., and creating a library of this bean spectroscopic data. This library of data, which can be stored in the database server 18 , can be used to compare against spectroscopic measurements by the integrated beverage system 12 or for verification if the provenance of any bean is called into question. Spectroscopic techniques can include mass spectrometry, laser spectroscopy, LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy), ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), or any other suitable methods. A spectroscopic signature can help verify provenance of coffee bean growth and the subsequent ability to verify beans after packaging into coffee pods or packages as described herein. Method 100 can include the step of Bean Grinding 106 . In an example embodiment, coffee beans can be ground prior to roasting, where the coffee beans can be ground in a “green” condition to any suitable size. Size of grounds can range for example from about 10 um to about 100 um, from about 100 um to about 500 um, from about 500 um to about 1000 um, or from about 1000 to about 3000 um. Grinding coffee beans prior to packaging and roasting may make the roasting process, particularly if performed by the integrated beverage system 12 , more efficient, while at the same time may preserve the freshness of the coffee beans as compared to traditional coffee beans that are roasted and then ground. The unroasted coffee bean grinding process can take place in a factory or other suitable setting as is commonly known in the art. It will be appreciated that any suitable size or shape of grounds can be created as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. In an alternate embodiment, the step of Bean Grinding 106 can include partially roasting the coffee beans prior to grinding the coffee beans, where partially roasting the beans may help maintain freshness but make a subsequent roasting process more efficient. In an alternate embodiment, the step of Bean Grinding 106 can include grinding green coffee beans to a first particle size, such as a coarse grind, where the coffee grounds can then be packaged. The integrated beverage system 12 can then be configured to further grind the coffee grounds from the first particle size to a smaller particle size, such as into a fine ground. It will be appreciated that any suitable step of roasting, grinding, or brewing can be performed in any suitable order and each step can be performed multiple times if desirable. Method 100 can include the step of Packaging Grounds 108 . Packaging Grounds 108 can include the use of single serve coffee containers, such as container 402 shown in FIG. 5, or packages for consumer preparation of coffee in single cup portions. Advantages of coffee pods can include convenience, single serve preparation so that coffee does not sit aging in pots, and the ability for a consumer to choose amongst pod types. Discrete coffee pods or packages can include small plastic or metal containers with ground unroasted coffee and filter material, such as filter paper or metal mesh, inside. Unroasted green coffee beans can be ground and packaged into small enclosed containers, such as pods, where each pod can contain enough green coffee grounds to ultimately produce one serving of coffee. The pod can be hermetically sealed or otherwise configured to preserve freshness. Pods can be used with the integrated beverage system 12 or the interactive beverage system 10 , for example. Ground green coffee beans may have a long shelf life and may not degrade rapidly as compared to ground and roasted coffee beans, or unground roasted coffee beans. Packaging Grounds 108 can include filling the ground coffee container with a gas, or any other suitable substance, to help preserve the enclosed grounds. This fill gas can be atmospheric air, nitrogen, inert gas, noble gas, or the pod can be vacuum packed. In an example embodiment, the pod can be filled with positive pressure gas (e.g., nitrogen, noble gas, or others). Each pod can contain approximately from about 0.1 to about 2 grams, from about 2 grams to about 10 grams, from about 10 grams to about 70 grams of ground green coffee beans. In certain cases, certain beans are known to improve with age and exposure to air, where pods containing such grounds may be packaged with a breathable membrane that can allow for the exchange of atmospheric air. The package or pod can be marked with an information code or bar code that can contain information about the grounds in the pod. Packages can be deliberately designed to be hard to reproduce to act as an anti-counterfeit measure. The pod can be made of recyclable materials or biodegradable materials. The compostable or recyclable pod may contain green unroasted beans, may mate or may be inserted into the systems as described herein, such as a system for roasting, grinding, and brewing, where the pod may contain the leftover grinds after brewing. In such an example the pod can be removed from the system and disposed of or can be reused for planting or other purposes. The convenience of a pod or capsule approach to coffee may be useful to the end consumer and using compostable material for the pod can prevent extra waste from being created, where conventional packaging uses non-recyclable plastics or materials that cannot be easily recycled. The pod can be made of any suitable compostable material such as wood pulp, bamboo, bagasse, sugarcane waste, wheat straw, corn plastic, miscanthus, or combinations thereof. In an alternate embodiment, the quantity of green coffee beans within a package can be adjusted depending on the type of roast contemplated, as beans lose weight during roast due to the loss of water from the bean during the roast process. For example, a dark roasted bean generally loses more water weight than a lightly roasted bean, where the quantity of beans within a pod can be adjusted to the appropriate amount at the time of packaging to account for this roast loss. Method 100 can include Package Verification 110 . Pod or Package Verification 110 can include imprinting the pod with a code, bar code, or other data that can be read by a scanner 404 of the integrated beverage system 400 (FIG. 5). Package Verification 110 can also include near field communication (NFC) methods, RFID, or other electronic components integrated into the pod that may be queried by wireless or wired means. Package Verification 110 can allow the integrated beverage system 400 to verify the authenticity of a coffee pod, such as container 402 , and can prevent fake containers from working in the integrated beverage system 400 . Encoded bean information and optimum preparation recipe instructions can be provided on the packaging that can be read and used by the integrated beverage system 400 . Package Verification 110 can also include anti-tampering features or data. The information, code, data, or the like can be printed on the package in any suitable form, such as a form invisible to the naked eye, to preserve the aesthetic appeal of the pod. One such example of an invisible code to the naked eye can include printing the code using phosphors that emit light when excited by higher energy light. A light emitting diode can be used to excite the phosphors and a camera can be used to read out the resulting information. The flash and camera contained in a smartphone can be used, for example. The container 402 can include features that can prevent tampering or can indicate if tampering has occurred. One embodiment can hermetically seal the container 402 , where a leak detector can be used to identify tampering. The container can be designed such that noninvasive measurement of the spectral features of the beans can be performed to verify provenance of the bean. In an example embodiment, a transparent window can be formed in a portion of the container that can allow for non-invasive laser spectroscopic measurements. Invasive tools can also be used that can take a sample from the bean, where the tool could be designed to puncture the container and self-seal the puncture when the tool is retracted. It will be appreciated that the scanner 404 can communicate with the interactive beverage system 10 to transmit data relative to the verification. Referring to FIG. 5, containers 402 can be designed in conjunction with the integrated beverage system 400 such that the integrated beverage system 400 can automatically open the pod upon insertion. For example, the integrated beverage system 400 can include a cutter 406 that can be associated with a motor 408 that can include an actuator or linear actuator to engage and rotationally cut the seal away from the container 402 . The integrated beverage system 400 can include a stepper motor 410 that can be configured to rotate and expel the contents of the container 402 into a funnel 412 leading to a roasting system 414 . An example roasting system 414 is illustrated in more detail with reference to FIG. 20. The integrity of the roasting process can be monitored by a camera 416 or the camera output can be used to adjust roasting parameters in a real time control loop. Any suitable package, pod, container, or packaging methods can be used to create a container 402 that can be designed for long life with reduced bean or ground degradation. Packages can be configured for storing, collecting, trading, and consuming specialty green coffee grounds in an analogous manner as to how fine wine is collected, stored, traded, and ultimately consumed. Fine wine may go up or down in value as the provenance or taste of the specific wine gains or loses reputation amongst collectors of wine; and due to supply and demand constraints. Similarly, fine green coffee grounds may have analogous taste and aroma characteristics that cannot be artificially duplicated, which can create a tradable value amongst connoisseurs. Referring to Figure. 2, Method 100 can include the step of Roasting 112 . Method 100 illustrates one version of a method of grinding green coffee beans, roasting the ground green coffee beans, and brewing coffee. Method 100 can introduce green coffee beans to the Roasting 112 step that may be ground to a small size, which can result in more surface area exposed to heat during roasting which can enable faster, more uniform, heat transfer throughout the green coffee bean particles. It will be appreciated that any sized grounds are contemplated. Providing small grounds can allow for more uniform roasting and faster roasting, which may be desirable. It will be appreciated that the steps of roasting, grinding, and brewing can be performed as three separate discrete steps. However, as described herein, partial or complete overlapping of these steps in time or space is contemplated and may reduce the total time required to make coffee. For example, the roasting and grinding may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may begin as some beans are roasted. Another example is that grinding and brewing may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may occur in a wet grind process which can initiate the brewing process. Other variations of combining process steps can occur. Referring to FIG. 5, the integrated beverage system 400 can have an array of sensors 418 built in to measure process parameters along with feedback control systems to optimize the performance of each step described herein. For Roasting 112 , such sensors can include a camera/color sensor to determine color change of beans during roasting, a humidity/water sensor to measure the water content in the roasting chamber, humidity sensor for ambient local air, a carbon monoxide sensor, a carbon dioxide sensor to measure CO2 emission during roasting, an optical spectroscopy system to measure chemical emissions during roasting, a temperature and time measurement along with roast profile control, a microphone sensor to listen for noise emissions during roasting, a gas chromatography or mass spectrometer to measure molecular species during roasting, or any other suitable sensor. Roasting 112 can include roasting of coffee grounds in single serve portions with the green coffee grounds provided in small pods. The roasting can occur within a few minutes and can roast, for example, from about 0.1 to about 2 grams, from about 2 to about 10 grams, or from about 10 to about 50 grams of grounds. The composition of the gas in the roasting chamber can be controlled as desired to be air, or some other mix of gases to aid in roasting. The integrated beverage system 400 can rapidly rise in temperature from ambient temperature of approximately 20 degrees Celsius to several hundred degrees Celsius in a precisely controlled manner. An ultrafast heater temperature increase ramp rate can be utilized that can be in the range of from about 1 to about 10 C/second, from about 10 to about 50 C/sec, from about 50 to about 100 C/sec, from about 100 to about 200 C/sec, from about 200 C/sec and higher, or combinations thereof. At the end of Roasting 112 , the temperature can be rapidly cooled and the temperature decrease ramp rate can be in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 C/second, from about 10 to about 50 C/sec, from about 50 to about 100 C/sec, from about 100 to about 200 C/sec, or combinations thereof. The overall time for roasting can be in the range of from about 1 to about 30 seconds, from about 30 to about 60 seconds, from about 60 to about 90 seconds, from about 90 to about 120 seconds, from about 120 to about 300 seconds, or any other suitable time. Roasting 112 can include a rapid heating method to roast the grounds and this heat can be applied by convection, conduction, radiation, or by any other suitable system or mechanism. Roasting can occur at temperature ranges of from about 200 to about 250 Celsius, from about 250 to about 300 C, from about 300 to about 350 C, from about 350 to about 400 C, from about 400 to about 500 C, or other such high temperature as desired. After Roasting 112 , it may be desirable to rapidly quench the grounds (i.e., rapidly cool down the grounds) to stop the ongoing processes in the grounds due to latent heat inside the grounds. This may be done in one of several ways including, for example, water immersion quenching or forced air quenching of the beans or grounds. The water used to brew the coffee can serve to quench the heat of the beans, where the water used for brewing can be just under 100 Celsius in contrast to the several hundred degree Celsius roast temperature. Roasting 112 can include a heating method that can enable the rapid temperature rise of the grounds. Referring to FIG. 5, a roasting system 414 can include an electrical resistor heating element 420 and a motor 422 associated with a fan (not shown) that can be used to heat and blow air into a chamber 424 , where this air can heat the coffee beans through convective heating. It will be appreciated that Roasting 112 can include any suitable heating system or method such as laser heating, where a laser of specific wavelength, spot size, and power level can be directed via an optical system to the green coffee grounds, which can absorb the radiation and heat up. Laser heating of green coffee grounds can be used to rapidly roast green coffee beans. The use of a laser can allow for direct heating of the grounds without heating up the air or other space around the grounds. Laser heating may provide very precise delivery of heat to the grounds since the heat source can be removed when the laser is turned off or blocked. The laser can be operated in a continuous mode, pulsed mode or some sequential combination of these modes to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize Roasting 112 . The grounds can be agitated mechanically or with air to move them into the path of the laser beam. The laser beam delivery system can be mounted on a mechanical system to move the beam across the array of coffee grounds to be roasted. Optical systems can be used to distribute the laser light uniformly across the grounds, or can be used to create a desired illumination profile across the coffee grounds. The laser used for illumination can be a diode laser, a diode laser single emitter, an array of diode laser single emitters, a diode laser bar, a diode laser stack of bars, or any other suitable laser or combination of lasers. The laser diodes can operate in the visible wavelength range, the near infrared wavelength range, or other infrared wavelength ranges, for example. The laser wavelength of operation can be chosen to correspond with specific spectral absorption features of the coffee grounds. A potential benefit of operating in the near infrared wavelength range is the commercial availability of high power laser diodes that have been developed for other applications. Roasting 112 can also be performed using a combination of heating methods that can include the laser radiation method along with convective resistive heating. In another embodiment of optical heating methods, a light emitting diode (LED) can be used instead of the laser light source with an appropriate optical system to direct the light from LED to the coffee grounds. In another embodiment, microwave energy can be used to rapidly heat and roast the grounds. Roasting 112 can also include radiation heating. Infrared or visible wavelength emission lamps can be used as the heating element. The green coffee grounds can absorb the radiated light from a bulb and heat up until roasted (the bulb can emit in the visible wavelength range, infrared wavelength range, or bands of wavelengths deemed desirable such as mid infrared, far infrared, etc.). The use of a lamp 421 (FIG. 20) can allow for fast roasting and direct heating of the green coffee grounds. The lamp can be operated in continuous, pulsed, or some combination of these modes to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize roasting. Lamps emit light in multiple directions and some emitted light may not hit the grounds. Thus to efficiently use the optical energy, it may be preferable to use optical cavity designs to collect and direct the emitted light to the target coffee grounds. Such optical cavity designs can include elliptical reflective cavities, multi-ellipse cavities, circular reflective cavities, etc. These cavity designs can be applied to roasting coffee where the coffee ground are placed in a transparent tube at one focus of the ellipse and the lamp is placed at the other focus such that the elliptical cavity focuses light onto the coffee beans. The optical cavity can be designed to illuminate the beans with a desired intensity profile for specific roasting as desired. The roasting can also be done using a combination of heating methods including a lamp radiation method along with convective resistive heating (fluidized bed methods). Any suitable cavity design can be used to capture and direct light to a focal spot while also homogenizing the focal spot light intensity. In some cases, it may be desirable to roast coffee beans with a hybrid convective and radiation based roasting system. An example of such a roasting system 414 is shown in FIG. 20, and can include an electrical resistor heating element 420 and a motor 422 that can be used to heat air in a chamber 424 , such that hot air can flow around the perimeter of the chamber and optical radiation can radiate from a central lamp 421 . The lamp 421 can be chosen for wavelengths in any part of the visible or infrared wavelength ranges. A potential benefit of this type of roasting can be the decoupling of the heating source, which may be optical, from the air flow that can agitate the beans. This separation can allow the independent control of roast process variables. Infrared optical roasting of green beans may result in coffee with a higher anti-oxidant concentration than green beans roasted with convective roasting. A hybrid roaster can allow for the programmable control of the heating source that is used, and the amount of that heating source, such that a roasting program can be adjusted to optimize the anti-oxidant concentration of the resultant coffee. Caffeine concentration of brewed coffee beverage can vary with the degree of roasting, where darker roasts may have a lower caffeine concentration. A hybrid optical and convective roaster can allow the customer to roast to a desired taste profile, caffeine concentration, antioxidant concentration, or to other desirable parameters. Chlorogenic acid, which may aid in weight loss or weight control, can be controlled by programming and adjusting the roasting parameters of the roaster and roasting process. During roasting of green coffee grounds, the color of the grounds can change from green to dark brown or black depending on the length of time roasted (longer time generally gives a darker color). Traditionally, these roast types and colors are denoted as cinnamon/New England, city/full city, Vienna, espresso, Italian, and French. Using quantitative measurements and methods such as precision imaging and signal processing, Roasting 112 can include a finer gradation in roast progress and thus much finer taste control. As the grounds are roasted, some smoke may be emitted and chaff may be released from the outside skin of the bean. The integrated beverage system 400 (for example, FIG. 5) can capture the smoke and/or the chaff such as with, for example, a catalytic converter, activated charcoal, or a filter 460 that can have an exhaust 462 . During the roasting process the beans or grounds can emit a defined popping sound at different times during roasting known as first crack and second crack. These sounds can be indicative of roasting progress and audio monitoring of this sound, such as with sensor 418 , with feedback control can be used to optimize roasting. During roasting, the beans or grounds emit an aroma that is pleasant to many people and a desirable trait to smell. The integrated beverage system 400 can include elements or features, such as containers or fans, to capture and disperse this aroma outside of the machine into the local environment for the pleasure of the consumer. In another embodiment, the integrated beverage system 400 can capture the aroma scent into a small hollow container, or container with porous polymer resins such as TENAX, or other device that can be opened later to release the aroma as desired by the user (or the aroma containment system could be attached to a coffee cup with aroma released in a time release manner, or at some later time). Roasting 112 generally includes heat, where extra waste heat from this process can be used to heat or pre-heat the water needed for the brewing process. As one example, water can be passed over the hot beans or grounds after roasting, which can serve to quench the roasting process in the beans and heat the water. This can improve the energy efficiency within the integrated beverage system 12 . Power efficiency in all steps of roasting, grinding, and brewing can be optimized or adjusted to provide the consumer with the highest quality coffee in the fastest possible time. As one example, the electrical power limit of most standard single phase electrical circuits in the US is approximately 1500 Watts. A roaster may consume up to, for example, 1500 Watts. A grinder may consume from about 100 to about 200 Watts, and a fast water heater or boiler for the brewing system may consume in the range of about 1000 to about 1500 Watts. In order to prepare a cup of coffee quickly, multiple stages can be operated in parallel or a stage can be prepared in advance so that it is ready (e.g., preheating the water to the desired temperature). Optimizing power efficiency of the roaster, or any other component, can allow parallel operations to take place such as heating the water while the roaster is in operation. Optical roasting may be advantageous because of the direct absorption of energy by the bean, which may allow the roaster to be more efficient and may keep power consumption below the common 1500 Watt limit. In some cases it may be desirable to modulate the aroma release such that the smell sensory system of the consumer does not become saturated and de-sensitized to the aroma. The integrated beverage system 400 can include any suitable components or elements that can automate handling of the grounds to move them from stage to stage of Method 100 . For example, moving the grounds from packaging to roasting to brewing. Robotic handling methods are contemplated are described in more detail herein. Referring to FIGS. 5 and 20, upon completion of Roasting 112 , the roasting system 414 can open a trap door 426 that can allow the roasted grounds to gravitationally move down a chute 428 to a brewing system 430 . It will be appreciated that any suitable mechanism or system to facilitate movement of the roasted grounds, such as a conveyor belt, is contemplated. Referring to FIG. 2, the method 100 can include Brewing 114 . Brewing 114 can include brewing particles that are ground and roasted. Brewing 114 can be performed by passing heated water through the grounds, which can extract the coffee into the liquid. Referring to FIG. 5, the integrated beverage system 400 can include a brewing system 430 that can include a brew chamber 432 that can accept the roasted grounds from the chute 428 . The brew chamber 432 can be coupled with a water reservoir 434 via a tube 436 . The water reservoir 434 can be associated with a heating element 438 and a water heater 440 such that heated water can be pumped with a pump 442 to the brew chamber 432 . The water reservoir can include a funnel 444 such that water can be poured into the water reservoir 434 . The water heater 440 and heating element 438 can include a rapid water heating system that can quickly bring water to the proper temperature for brewing coffee. The water temperature can be brought to boiling (212 F), or some other temperature range such as from about 150 degrees to about 160 degrees Fahrenheit, from about 160 degrees to about 175 degrees Fahrenheit, from about 176 to about 195 degrees Fahrenheit, from about 196 degrees to about 211 degrees Fahrenheit, or any other suitable temperature. A water temperature in the range of from about 195 degrees to about 205 degrees Fahrenheit is contemplated. It may be desirable to brew at relatively lower temperatures, such as with what is known as ‘cold brew’, which can result in a different taste of coffee. Cold brewing can be done at or near room temperature and the steep time can be many hours to days. In an example embodiment, overall water temperature can be reduced, by using high speed centrifugal forces in the brew extraction process to rapidly mix and agitate the grinds within the liquid water. A suitable balance of water temperature between ambient and 212 F is contemplated, and high speed centrifugal forces can be used to quickly brew coffee to the desired taste. Referring to FIG. 5, the coffee grounds can be retained within the brew chamber 432 , where the brew chamber 432 can be associated with a filter 446 that can be positioned at the bottom of the brew chamber 432 . The filter 446 can be paper or metallic mesh, for example. The coffee grounds can be tamped or compressed by the brew system 430 as desired where, for example, the brew system 430 can include a piston 448 that can be coupled with a motor 450 . The pressure of compression can be varied by the integrated beverage system 400 as desired. This can be performed by controlling piston 448 movement or by use of an adjustable pressure relief valve that can control the release of coffee from the brew chamber 432 . In some cases, multiple parallel pistons (not shown) can be used where the specific amount of grinds, quantity of hot water, the steep time, and other extraction parameters may be different for each piston and associated brew chamber to create varying taste profiles, where the output of all piston brewers can be mixed into one cup for consumption by the consumer. Water can be injected into the brew chamber 432 at high pressure or any other suitable pressure, including a drip method. The water pressure can range from about 0.1 bar to about 18 bar depending on the coffee type (e.g., coffee, espresso, etc.) desired and the desired taste of coffee. A refractometer or other sensors 452 can be incorporated into the integrated beverage system 400 and can provide real time measurement and feedback control of various brew parameters to optimize coffee taste. The amount of water used in making a cup of coffee can be from about 0.1 ounces to about 20 ounces, or any suitable amount. The brewing time can be less than one second, from about 1.01 second to about 30 seconds, from about 30.01 second to about 60 seconds, from about 60.01 seconds to about 120 seconds, from about 120.01 seconds to about 180 seconds, from about 180.01 seconds to about 300 seconds, from about 300.01 second or longer, or any other suitable time frame. Referring to FIG. 2, the Method 100 can include Dispensing 116 . Dispensing 116 can include dispensing the coffee or other prepared beverage from the integrated beverage system 400 (FIG. 5). Dispensing 116 can include dispensing the coffee via a nozzle or valve 453 into a cup or any other suitable receptacle. Cup sizes or other aspects of the delivery can be specified by the user or preprogrammed. Various other fluids or substances can be combined during Dispensing 116 where, for example, milk, creamer, sugar, whipped cream, sweetener, flavoring, vitamins, or other products can be added manually or automatically. Espresso-based drinks are contemplated and include espresso, cappuccino, latte, etc. In example embodiments, an integrated beverage system, as described herein, can be used with a tamping mechanism for grinds and the brewing components can be replaced or supplemented with a high pressure boiler system for the water. The pressurized hot water can be forced through the grinds and espresso extraction can occur. Additionally, the integrated beverage system can contain a milk heater, steamer, and/or frothing function. Such systems may be used in a professional cafe or restaurant setting, where it may be desirable to prepare multiple independent cups of coffee at the same time. A single machine can be configured with multiple components such that multiple cups of coffee can be made in parallel. Certain steps or components in such a system may be performed independently, such as roasting, grinding, or brewing, but some elements may be in common such as a common water heating system with valves or pumps to direct water to the appropriate location. Common electronic control systems can be used that can control multiple roasters, grinders, or brewers. Such a machine can also have a robotic handling system that can automatically choose and insert an appropriate coffee container from a variety of options, in accordance with a user's order, into the integrated beverage system for processing. Referring to FIG. 3, an alternate Method 200 is depicted for providing coffee to a consumer. Method 200 can be performed at least partially by the interactive beverage system 10 , the integrated beverage system 12 , the integrated beverage system 500 , or the integrated beverage system 1500 . It will be appreciated that any suitable steps of the method 200 can be performed by the integrated beverage system 500 or can be performed independently from the integrated beverage system 500 . In some embodiment, the entire process of Method 200 can happen quickly such as, for example, in from about 0.01 to about 30 seconds, from about 30.01 to about 60.0 seconds, from about 60.01 to about 120.0 seconds, from about 120.01 to about 300 seconds, or from about 300.01 to about 600 seconds. Traditional coffee brewing methods generally take much longer than this and even one step, such as pourover brewing, can take 4 minutes or more. The method 200 can include the steps of Bean Marking 202 and Bean Verification 204 , which can be analogous to the steps of Bean Marking 102 and Bean Verification 104 , respectively, as described with reference to FIG. 2. The method 200 can include the step of Bean Packaging 208 . Bean Packaging 208 can be similar to, and can include the disclosure of, the step of Packaging Grounds 108 described in FIG. 2. In an example embodiment, it may be preferable to package whole unroasted or “green” coffee beans prior to roasting or grinding. A single pod or container 1000 (FIG. 12) can be packaged and organized as a series of independent coffee beans (Bean Arrangement 218 ) or a container 502 (FIGS. 6, 10) can simply be filled and packaged with a predetermined number of coffee beans (Multi-Bean Arrangement 219 ). Coffee may degrade in freshness from the moment it is ground, where it may be preferable to package and ship unroasted whole coffee beans to consumers prior to grinding or roasting. Volatile organic compounds can be created during roasting that can make up at least a portion of the flavor of coffee, where these compounds may escape from the beans from the moment of roast ending such that the longer the roasted beans sit, the more VOC's are lost to the atmosphere. It may be preferable to retain the beans in an unroasted state for as long as possible. For the step of Bean Packaging 208 , which can include the Single Bean Arrangement 218 (container 1000 shown in FIG. 12) and Multi-Bean Arrangement 219 (container 502 shown in FIG. 11) steps, green coffee beans can be packaged into small enclosed containers or pods where each pod can contain enough green coffee beans to produce one serving of coffee. The one or a plurality of pods or packages can be hermetically sealed with a seal 504 and can include a validation marking 510 . These containers, such as container 502 , can be used with the integrated beverage system 500 . The container 502 can include a body 530 that can define a cavity configured to retain a plurality of coffee beans and a seal 532 that can be manually or automatically punctured, removed, or otherwise opened as described herein. Green coffee beans generally have a long shelf life relative to roasted coffee beans and do not degrade rapidly, where the shelf life of green coffee beans may be years or more if stored properly. An example container 502 can be filled with a gas to preserve the enclosed beans for long periods of time. Any suitable fluid or gas can be used including atmospheric air, nitrogen, inert gas, noble gas, or the pod may be vacuum packed. In some cases the pod may be filled with positive pressure gas (e.g., nitrogen, noble gas, or others). Each container 502 can contain approximately from about 0.1 to about 2 grams, from about 2 to about 10 grams, or from about 10 to about 70 grams of green coffee beans. In certain cases, certain beans are known to improve with age and exposure to air, where containers 502 containing such beans can be packaged with a breathable membrane that can allow for atmospheric air exchange. Referring to FIG. 21, an alternate version of a container 1402 is shown that can be constructed from recyclable or compostable material. The container 1402 can include a body 1430 and a lid 1432 , where each element can be compostable or recyclable. Referring to FIG. 22, the underside of the lid 1432 can include one or a plurality of plant or fauna seeds 1434 and the body 1430 can retain roasted and brewed coffee grounds 1436 , where such coffee grounds 1436 can be excellent fertilizer. After the container 1402 has been used with the integrated beverage system, soil can be added to the coffee grounds and the entire container 1402 can be planted in the ground. In such a manner what was once unrecyclable trash can now be transformed into a readymade planter. The integrated beverage system or process may unlock or release this seed 1434 during or after the coffee making process to make it easier to use the pod as a planter. For example, the seed 1432 may be contained in a water soluble pouch (not shown) or covering that may dissolve during a coffee process step to expose the seed. Heat can be used to expose the seed or any other mechanism to expose the seed can be incorporated. Alternatively, the end user can manually access the seed 1434 after the coffee making process is finished. In one embodiment, the packaging container (not shown) in which an array of pods is shipped may contain a package of seeds for the end user to implant into the used pods. The packaging container could hold, for example, any suitable number of pods such as 1, 2, 10, 100 or any other number. The packaging container may also contain other items to aid in growth of seeds such as soil, fertilizer, or the like. The packaging container of an array of pods may be designed so that it becomes a holder (not shown) of the pods in a planter configuration that can make it convenient for the end user to grow an array of plants simultaneously in a compact space for indoor gardening or outdoor gardening (the planter may be vertical, horizontal, or other configuration). In such an embodiment every part of the packaging, or substantially every part of the packaging, can be re-used with no waste. In one embodiment, used pods can be shipped back to a central facility for distribution to end users that want to use the pods for planting. The pods can be inserted partially into each other to be stackable and save space during shipping. The pods can be used in a greenhouse or other farming operation to grow new plants. The pods can be designed to mate into receptacles for ease of use in growing facilities such as farms or greenhouses. The pod can also be made of edible material such as sorghum or the like. These edible materials can be made shelf stable by processing using any suitable method. Such edible material pods may be used as foodstuffs for human or animal consumption after making coffee, or may be faster to biodegrade after use. Referring back to FIG. 11, in an example embodiment, beans can be pre-sorted and packaged with beans of a similar size and color into a single container 502 . The value of this sorting may be that the roasting of the beans will progress similarly when exposed to heat and thus produce a uniform roast, which may be desirable. Such a sorting system can also detect spoiled or undesirable beans that may have phenol content or other impurities that impair taste of the final beverage. Containers 502 , as described herein, can be marked to help verify the authenticity of the coffee pod, to prevent counterfeit pods from working in the integrated beverage system 12 , to encode bean information and optimum preparation recipe instructions, to encode origin information, to prevent tampering, or to act as anti-counterfeit measures. Note that the pods may be inserted into a machine or array of machines by an automatic external robotic system that may pick a pod out of an array of pods based on the user choice and initiates operation of the coffee machine. The resulting cup of coffee may be robotically moved by the system to a position to serve the customer such that the machine becomes available for the next use. The used pod may be automatically removed from the machine by the machine itself or external robotic system. The robotics system may have RFID, camera system with computer vision, or the like, to be able to pick the correct pod from the array as desired by the user. The pod may have enough coffee beans to make 1 cup of coffee, 2 cups of coffee, or any N number of cups of coffee and the cup size may vary depending on user preference (the pod may contain beans that are a non-integer number of cups of coffee also). The liquid used to brew the coffee may be water, water with additives for nutritional benefit such as antioxidants or other healthful ingredients. The water may be pH controlled or other minerals/ingredients added for optimal taste. The water may come from multiple reservoirs in the machine (each reservoir may have different water characteristics) and can be mixed in real time to control the pH or other characteristics of the water. The brewing system may have more than one boiler such that brewing can be sequentially done with water of different temperatures to control flavors extracted at each step. The water heating may be done by boiler system, instant hot water system, or other methods including heat exchanger from hot air. Referring to FIGS. 12A and 12B, the container 1000 can be configured such that each bean of a plurality of unroasted coffee beans 900 can be individually roasted by an integrated coffee system 12 . The container 1000 can include a base 1002 that can engage with a lid 1004 such that a plurality of unroasted coffee beans 900 can be retained therebetween. The plurality of unroasted coffee beans 900 can reside within a plurality of cavities 1006 that can be defined by a tray 1008 . Referring to FIG. 12B, the tray 1008 can rest upon a thick film substrate 1010 that can include a plurality of thick film heaters 1012 , where each of the thick film heaters 1012 can be configured to be in close proximity with each of the plurality of beans 900 held within the tray 1008 . During operation, air can be forced through an intake 1014 in the base 1002 such that the plurality of thick film heaters 1012 can heat the local air to turn roast the plurality of unroasted coffee beans 900 . The lid 1004 can include an exhaust 1016 that can be used to expel smoke or the like. It will be appreciated that any configuration for a container that can roast beans individually is contemplated. In an example embodiment, the container 1000 can be purchased as a contained unit where the container 1000 can be inserted into the integrated beverage system 12 . After roasting, the container 1000 can be mechanically and automatically opened or otherwise emptied such that the roasted beans can be transferred to a grinding mechanism. The roasted beans can be removed, for example, by tipping over the container 1000 , using a high fan speed associated with a heating element to eject the beans, or a vacuum that could be used to suction the beans out of the container 1000 . In an alternative embodiment, single-bean roasting can be accomplished by having a common fan system and a common heating system that can blow hot air towards beans that can be arranged in pockets as shown in FIG. 12A. In such an embodiment, an independent mechanical shutter can be positioned below each bean in the array that can allow air to flow to the bean when the shutter is open or can obstruct air flow when the shutter is closed such that roast control on an individual bean can be provided. The container 1000 can be associated with an optical imaging system (not shown) with a camera that can monitor the color change of each bean during roasting. This information can be used with a feedback control system to turn on/off or adjust the heat and/or airflow to each bean independently. Other sensors described herein can also be used in conjunction with the camera for feedback control on either an individual bean basis or on an aggregate basis. Bean Packaging 208 can include packaging coffee beans, where some processing step has already been performed on the beans prior to packaging. For example, the green coffee beans can be partially roasted and then packaged into the container 502 (FIG. 6), which may save roasting time when prepared by the consumer. The partial roasting can be performed, for example, in a manner that can preserve the freshness of the bean and can prevent or delay decaying or staleness of the bean relative to conventional roasting. For example, partial roasting could stop at or before “first crack” of the coffee bean. The Method 200 of FIG. 3 can include the steps of Package Verification 210 , 211 , which can correspond with the step of Package Verification 110 described with reference to FIG. 2. Package Verification 210 , 211 can be performed by the integrated beverage system 500 , scanner 404 , manually by the user, by inputting information into a personal computer 14 , a smartphone 22 , or any other suitable input device. The Method 200 can include steps for Roasting 212 , 213 . As illustrated in FIG. 3, the Roasting 212 , 213 steps can be performed by the integrated beverage system 500 and can include the disclosure of the Roasting 112 step described with reference to FIG. 2. Although Method 200 generally describes the steps for creating coffee in the order of roasting, grinding, and brewing as three separate discrete steps, it will be appreciated that any suitable order or combination is contemplated. For example, partial or complete overlapping of these steps in time or space is contemplated, where such a combination may reduce the total time required to make coffee. For example, the roasting and grinding may occur in the same vessel and grinding may begin as bean roasting begins. In an alternate embodiment, grinding and brewing can occur in the same vessel and the grinding can occur in a wet grind process which initiates the brewing process. Other variations of combining process steps are contemplated. In some cases it may be desirable to rapidly quench the roasting of the beans after external heat application has stopped. Heat internal to the beans may continue the roasting process. An alternate approach to rapid quenching can include quickly grinding the beans to increase surface area exposure to air. At this point, air can be flowed through the grounds to cool the coffee grounds. An alternate embodiment can include immersing the grounds in water, where the water is of lower temperature than the roasting temperature such that roasting can be quenched. The rapid quenching process can be performed by an integrated beverage system as described herein, or can be used separately for quenching roasted beans independent of any other machine. In one embodiment, it may be advantageous to rapidly de-gas the carbon dioxide that can be built up in the bean during roasting. With typical roasting, the beans generally remain whole for some period of time after roasting. In one embodiment, the beans can be ground quickly after roasting, which can greatly increase the surface area of the beans exposed to air and can increase the rate that CO2 escapes from the beans or grounds. A vacuum can be provided in the chamber holding the grounds such that the pressure in the chamber can be reduced below ambient air pressure. This vacuum may be to levels such as about 0.5 atmospheres, about 0.1 atmospheres, about 0.01 atmospheres, about 0.001 atmospheres, or any other pressure level to aid in the rapid release of CO2 gas. In some cases it may be advantageous to illuminate the grounds with optical energy corresponding to the absorption wavelength of CO2 molecules such as 10.6 um. With reference to Roasting 212 in a Single Bean Arrangement 218 , roasting of beans can be done on an individual basis, which may create uniform roasting and can optimize taste. The quantity of green beans needed for a single cup of coffee may range from 50 to 500 beans, where approximately 100 beans may be typical. Individual beans can be arranged in the single-serve container 502 such that each bean can be exposed to a radiative light based heating system (e.g., laser, LED, lamp, etc.), where the beans can be aligned in a pattern with a corresponding pattern of illumination sources (this can include a 1:1 mapping, or N:M mapping of sources to beans). This can include optical only roasting, convective roasting only, fluidized bed roasting, or hybrid optical/convective roasting. An optical system can be used between the sources and beans such that each bean is illuminated by one light source with the desired illumination pattern. Each light source can have individual power control or sub-arrays or the light source can have a single power control. By using a 1:1 mapping of light sources to beans, each bean can be illuminated and heated with individual control. A camera can be used to image the color of the beans and along with image processing algorithms can be used to provide feedback or individual power adjustment control to the individual light sources to optimize roasting (a wavelength selective filter can be placed in front of the camera to filter out the light used to roast the beans). In an example embodiment, the beans can be roasted to substantially the same degree of roast (e.g., color of roast) or a roast blend can intentionally be created where some beans can be roasted to a different degree purposefully to get a desired taste profile. In an alternate embodiment, instead of single bean cavities, several separate cavities can be created containing a subset of beans and corresponding lamps can be controlled separately based on feedback sensors to optimize roast within each cavity. The beans from plurality of cavities can, for example, be mixed before grinding. An array of resistive heating elements, with each element in contact with one bean, can be used as an alternative to a light-based heating system. It will be appreciated that any suitable system, method, or mechanism to individually roast a single bean, or a small number of beans, is contemplated. The integrated beverage system 500 (FIG. 6) can have an array of sensors 418 , 452 built in to measure process parameters along with feedback control systems that can optimize the performance of each step the machine performs. For roasting, such sensors 418 can include a camera or color sensor that can determine color change of beans during roasting, a humidity or water sensor that can measure the water content in the roasting chamber, a humidity sensor that can measure ambient local air, a carbon dioxide sensor that can measure CO2 emission during roasting, an optical spectroscopy system that can measure chemical emissions during roasting, a gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) system to measure chemical emissions, a temperature and time measurement sensor than can be combined with a roast profile control, or a microphone sensor to listen for first crack, second crack of the beans, or noise emissions during roasting. The Method 200 can include the steps of Grinding 206 , 207 . The Grinding 206 , 207 steps can be performed by the integrated beverage system 500 and can include the disclosure of the Grinding 106 step described with reference to FIG. 2. The integrated beverage system 500 can include any suitable grinder system 504 that can grind the roasted beans into any suitably sized particles. The grinder system 504 can accept the roasted beans from the trap door 426 . The grinder system 504 can include a body 506 , a motor 508 , a grain-size filter 510 , and a chute 512 that can convey roasted grounds to the brewing system 430 . The average particle size can vary, for example, from between about 10 microns to about 2000 microns. An electrically powered grinder can be adjustable to a desired particle size. The grinder system 504 can include a blade grinder, a burr grinder, a disc burr grinder, a conical burr grinder, ultrasonic grinder, wet grinder, mortar and pestle grinder, or any other grinder. The grinder system 504 can be configured to produce a uniform particle size or particles having varying sizes. Grinding time can be from about 1 second to about 10 seconds, from about 10 second to about 30 seconds, from about 30 second to about 60 seconds, from about 60 second to about 120 seconds, or for greater than 120 seconds. The grinder system 504 can also be adaptively controlled such that the mechanical adjustment of grind size can be determined by the degree of roasting of the coffee beans performed in the integrated beverage system 500 . The fracture mechanics of coffee beans in the grinder system 504 can depend on the degree of roasting such that darker roasts may fracture to finer particles than lighter roasts even when the mechanics of the grinder remain unchanged. It may be valuable to adjust grinder system 504 mechanics based on information about the degree of coffee bean roasting. In an example embodiment, after Roasting 212 , 214 , the integrated beverage system 500 can automatically move the roasted beans from the roasting stage to the grinder system 504 using gravity or active transportation. After Grinding 206 , 207 , the integrated beverage system can automatically move the grounds to the brewing system 430 . In an alternate embodiment, as will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 8, after Roasting 212 , 214 , an integrated beverage system 700 can move a grinding tool 718 that can be associated with Grinding 206 , 207 into proximity with roasted beans. After the beans are ground, the integrated beverage system 700 can move the equipment or components associated with Brewing 214 , 215 into proximity with the roasted grounds. It will be appreciated that the beans and/or grounds can remain in substantially the same location, where the integrated beverage system 700 can move, rotate, or otherwise bring the tools associated with the Method 200 into proximity with the beans or grounds. In an alternate embodiment, the tools associated with the steps of the Method 200 can remain substantially stationary and the beans or grounds can be moved or otherwise transitioned between various stations. Grinding 206 , 207 steps can include sensors such as optical sensors to visually monitor grind size, a vibration sensor (e.g., accelerometer) that can monitor progress of grinding, or a microphone that can measure noise from the grinder to determine grind size. The grind process makes audible noise, where it may be possible to use active noise canceling techniques along with an embedded audio speaker to mute or minimize the noise generated by the grinder. Similarly, other process steps such as roasting or brewing may make audible noise that can be minimized by active noise canceling methods. The Method 200 can include Brewing 214 , 215 , which can include the disclosure of Brewing 114 described with reference to FIG. 2, and Dispensing 216 , 217 , which can include the disclosure of Dispensing 116 described with reference to FIG. 2. Brewing 214 , 215 can include sensors 452 (FIG. 5) such as a sensor for water temperature, water pressure, water pH, optical absorption, optical color sensor, optical light scattering, optical polarization to measure coffee extraction from the grind, a refractometer that can measure coffee extraction, a surface plasmon resonance (spr) sensor that can measure other chemical parameters of brewing, or other chemical sensors. In an alternate embodiment, with reference to FIG. 8, some or all of the steps of Roasting 212 , 214 , Grinding 206 , 207 , and Brewing 214 , 215 can be performed within a container 702 containing a single-serving size of coffee, where the container 702 can remain substantially stationary. The container 702 that can contain unroasted beans can be engaged by the integrated beverage system 700 such that one or a plurality of grinding, roasting, brewing, scanning, or any other suitable tools or systems act upon the container 702 . The container can be installed onto a holder 806 that can also include a dispensing tube 708 . The holder 706 can be configured to retain the container 702 throughout the roasting, grinding, and/or brewing process. The holder 706 can retain the container 702 as various tools move into proximity with or engage the container 702 . A scanner 704 can initially confirm that the container 702 is not a counterfeit. After the scanner 704 , the container 702 can be engaged by a roasting tool 716 for Roasting 212 , 214 . The roasting tool 716 can include, for example, hot air delivery and an exhaust. After Roasting 212 , 214 , the integrated beverage system 700 can engage the container 702 with the grinding tool 718 that can be associated with Grinding 206 , 207 , where any suitable tools, such as a burr grinder or ultrasonic grinder, can enter the container 702 to grind the beans as desired. The container 702 can then be engaged by a brewing tool 720 that can be associated with Brewing 214 , 214 , where the brewing step can occur wholly or partially within the container 702 . The brewing tool 720 can include a hot water reservoir 722 , a pump 724 , and a water reservoir 726 that can be connected with tubing 728 . In this manner, the steps of roasting, grinding, and brewing can occur within the container 702 . A computer or control system 730 can guide the tools of the integrated beverage system 700 to engage the container 702 . In another alternate embodiment, some or all of the steps of Roasting 212 , 214 , Grinding 206 , 207 , and Brewing 214 , 215 can be performed within a package 802 containing a single-serving size of coffee, where the package 802 can be moved and the tools remain substantially stationary. For example, referring to FIG. 9, a package 802 containing unroasted beans can be transitioned by a beverage system 800 to a first station 804 that can install the package 802 into a movable holder 806 that can be associated with a stepper motor 808 , a track 810 , and a linear actuator 812 . The holder 806 can be configured to retain the package 802 throughout the roasting, grinding, and brewing process. The holder 806 can transition the package 802 between various stations as the stepper motor 808 moves within the track 810 and where the linear actuator 812 can be configured to engage the package with each station. After the first station 804 , the package 802 can be transitioned to a second station 814 that can be used to scan or validate that package 802 . After completing the second station 804 , the package 802 can be transitioned to a roasting station 816 for Roasting 212 , 214 . The roasting station 816 can include, for example, hot air delivery 822 and an exhaust 824 . After Roasting 212 , 214 , the integrated beverage system 800 can transition the package 802 to a grinding station 818 that can be associated with Grinding 206 , 207 , where any suitable tools, such as a burr grinder or ultrasonic grinder, can enter the package 802 to grind the beans as desired. The package 802 can then be transitioned to a brewing station 820 that can be associated with Brewing 214 , 214 , where the brewing step can occur wholly or partially within the package 802 . The brewing station 820 can include a hot water input 826 and a brewed coffee output 826 that can lead to a drinking receptacle. In this manner, the steps of roasting, grinding, and brewing can occur within the package 802 or pod. A computer or control system 830 can guide the stepper motor 808 , transition the package 802 , or otherwise move the package through the stations of the integrated beverage system 800 . In an example embodiment, the package with green coffee beans can contain a resistive heating element that can mate to a current source in the integrated beverage system to roast coffee. In an alternate embodiment, the package can be transparent and can allow optical energy provided by the integrated beverage machine to impinge upon the beans and roast the beans. The integrated beverage machine can break a seal on the package or otherwise puncture the package as needed during these steps. Another approach to grinding is to apply sonic energy to the roasted beans to cause the beans to fracture into small particles; and/or high pressure water may be applied to the beans to cause them to fracture. Water may be injected into the pod in order to brew the coffee. Referring to FIGS. 13A-15B, alternate containers are disclosed that can be configured such that some or all of the steps of Roasting 212 , 214 , Grinding 206 , 207 , and Brewing 214 , 215 can be performed within the pod or package containing, for example, a single-serving size of coffee. FIGS. 13A and 13B illustrate one version of a container 1100 that can be configured for roasting, grinding, and brewing within the container 1100 . The container 1100 can include a cylindrical body 1102 that can be made from metal, aluminum, or any other suitable material and can define a cavity (not shown) that can be configured to retain a plurality of green coffee beans. The container 1100 can include a seal 1104 , filter 1106 , and a plurality of indents 1108 that can be substantially sealed prior to use of the container 1100 . Referring to FIG. 13B, the plurality of indents 1108 can be sealed, for example, by a plurality of flaps 1158 . The container 1100 can include a validation marking 1110 that can be read by an integrated beverage system 12 or 800 , for example. FIG. 14 illustrates an alternate embodiment of a container 1200 , where the container 1200 can have a substantially toroid or donut-shaped body 1202 . The container 1200 can include a seal 1204 , filter 1206 , validation marking 1210 , and a plurality of indents 1208 . A cylindrical wall 1214 of the body 1202 can define an inner cylinder 1212 , where the cylindrical wall of the body 1202 can be substantially transparent. In an example embodiment, the body 1202 can be placed over an optical heating element (not shown) such that light can penetrate the body 1202 through the cylindrical wall 1214 and can roast coffee beans. In an example embodiment, room temperature air can be flowed through the inner cylinder 1212 in the center of the container 1200 to keep the temperature of the transparent cylindrical wall 1214 within acceptable ranges and allow the use of low cost transparent plastics or other materials. It will be appreciated that any suitable container configuration is contemplated that can be used with any suitable roasting system or method. FIGS. 15A and 15B illustrate an alternate embodiment of a container 1300 that can include a body 1302 , seal 1304 , filter 1306 , validation marking 1310 , and a plurality of indents 1308 that can be positioned on the filter 1306 or bottom surface of the body 1302 . Referring to FIG. 15B, providing forced heated air through the plurality of indents 1308 can cause beans within the container 1300 to travel vertically and radially outward towards the perimeter of the body 1302 , where the beans can then drop back down towards the filter 1306 such that the beans are substantially mixed within the container 1300 to provide substantially even roasting. FIGS. 16-19 illustrate an example embodiment of a method for using the container 1100 illustrated in FIGS. 13A and 13B. Referring to FIG. 16, the container 1100 is shown prior to engagement with a roasting assembly 1150 according to one embodiment. The roasting assembly 1150 can include a pair of hemispherical members 1152 that can be actuated to engage the circumference of the body 1102 of the container 1100 . The hemispherical members 1152 can include a plurality of hollow teeth 1154 that can be configured to penetrate the plurality of indents 1108 on the body 1102 as shown in FIG. 17. The plurality of hollow teeth 1154 can be coupled with a heat source 1156 that can communicate hot air through the hemispherical members 1152 , through the plurality of hollow teeth 1154 , and into the cavity defined by the body 1102 such that the beans are roasted. Upon completion of the roasting process, which can be determined by a control system or by the user, the roasting assembly 1150 can be disengaged from the container 1100 . When the roasting assembly 1150 is disengaged, a plurality of flaps 1158 , which can be pushed inwardly by the plurality of hollow teeth 1154 , can return to a resting position and substantially seal the cavity defined by the body 1102 . Referring to FIG. 18, a grinding assembly 1160 can be engaged with the container 1100 to grind the beans within the container 1100 . The grinding assembly can include a plurality of grinders, such as ultrasonic grinders, that can penetrate the seal 1104 and form one or a plurality of apertures 1162 (FIG. 19). The grinding process can include any suitable tools and any suitable type or direction of penetration. The grinding process can include packaging inert grinding media in the container 1100 . The grinding process can use the plurality of indents of the container 1100 to form a portion of a mechanical grinding mechanism. The grinding process can be controlled manually or by any suitable control system. An alternative to physical grinding can be to impinge high pressure water on the beans that can cause the beans to fracture into small pieces. In alternate embodiments, the coffee beans can have small mechanical or laser drilled holes formed in them to ease the fracture process. Hot water or steam can be injected into such holes, which can be used to extract coffee from the beans, which can be referred to as “in-bean brewing”. In an alternate embodiment, the coffee bean can be laser ablated such that the ablation products can be captured and mixed with water to form the drink. In this case, the bean may be a green bean or a roasted bean. The local atmosphere surrounding the beans can be controlled by introducing certain gases or gas mixtures to aid in the laser ablation process. Laser ablation can be performed by pulsed, high peak power lasers such as CO2 lasers, excimer lasers, pulsed diode lasers, and other such lasers. It will be appreciated that coffee beans or coffee grounds can be broken apart, reduced in diameter, ground, mashed, pulverized, cut, chopped, reduced, burst, drilled, cored, fired, or otherwise modified by the integrated beverage system. In an alternate embodiment, the one or a plurality of apertures 1162 can be formed by the integrated beverage system during the roasting stage (for example, as shown in FIG. 13B) such that heated air is able to escape the container 1100 . Referring to FIG. 19, a brewing assembly 1170 can be engaged with the container 1100 to brew coffee within the container 1100 . The brewing assembly can contain a plurality of hot water delivery tubes 1172 , for example that can deliver hot water through the one or a plurality of apertures 1162 created by the grinding assembly 1160 or roasting assembly. The hot water can engage the coffee grounds, where brewed coffee can then be forced through or can drip through the filter 1106 positioned on the bottom surface of the container 1100 . Referring to FIGS. 69-70B, shown are alternate embodiments for a pod that can contain green unroasted coffee beans, where the coffee beans can be roasted inside the pod. Hot air can be injected into the pod to roast the beans in the pod. The pod can be made of any high temperature material including, for example, metals, ceramics, mica, or the like. Such embodiments can use relatively cost aluminum foil, stainless steel foil, mica paper, baking parchment paper or board, or the like. Features in the pod, such as an angled or ramped floor, may be provided to allow the beans to swirl or agitate in the injected hot air such that the beans can convectively heat evenly but not burn. The bottom of the pod may also have spiral features to create an upward spiral air motion that can cause the beans to spin. The bottom of the pod can include a filter or mesh through which hot air can pass, but the beans cannot pass. Referring to FIG. 4, an alternate Method 300 is depicted for providing coffee to a consumer. Method 300 can be performed at least partially by the interactive beverage system 10 , the integrated beverage system 12 , or the integrated beverage system 600 (FIG. 7). It will be appreciated that any suitable steps of the method 300 can be performed by the integrated beverage system 600 or can be performed independently from the integrated beverage system 600 . Method 300 can include the steps of Bean Marking 302 and Bean Verification 304 , which can be analogous to the steps of Bean Marking 102 and Bean Verification 104 , respectively, as described with reference to FIG. 2. Method 300 can include the step of Bean Packaging 308 , which can incorporate the disclosure described with reference to Bean Packaging 208 , Single Bean Arrangement 218 , or Multi-Bean Arrangement 219 shown in FIG. 3. Method 300 can include the step of Package Verification, which can incorporate the disclosure of Package Verification 110 shown in FIG. 2. Method 300 can include the step of Grinding 306 , which can incorporate the disclosure described with reference to Grinding 206 , 207 shown in FIG. 3. As illustrated, unroasted coffee beans can be packaged, such as in single-serving containers 502 , where the single-serving package can be inserted into the integrated beverage system 600 . The integrated beverage system 600 can then validate the container 502 and remove the coffee beans from the package or pod. After removal, the unroasted coffee beans can go through the Grinding 306 step prior to being roasted. Method 300 can include the step of Roasting 312 , which can incorporate the disclosure associated with Roasting 212 shown in FIG. 3. Method 300 can then transition to the steps of Brewing 314 and Dispensing 316 , which can correspond to the steps of Brewing 114 and Dispensing 116 shown in FIG. 2. In the illustrated version, the integrated beverage system 12 can verify bean packaging, roast coffee beans, grind coffee beans, and then brew coffee all within the same machine. In some cases it may be beneficial for a consumer to keep track of their coffee intake. This can be accomplished with the help of a smartphone app or website with personalized information based on the coffee consumption history of that individual. The app can keep track of coffee intake by interfacing with the integrated beverage system 12 of FIG. 1, for example. It is known that the caffeine level in the body is boosted immediately after consuming coffee and decreases in an approximately exponential decay fashion over the course of 10-20 hours. It is also known that caffeine increases mental alertness and acuity. The app can keep track of coffee intake and suggest types of coffee, roast level, etc., to the user to maintain a desired level of mental alertness or acuity (i.e., maintain a certain caffeine level in the body). The app can make these suggestions based on the time, type, quantity of previous coffee drinks, a reference caffeine metabolism curve, and learning about the user's personal caffeine metabolism rate. This personal metabolism rate can be determined by user response to questions or user response to tests of mental acuity. The app can also place an order or control the integrated beverage system 12 of FIG. 1 at the appropriate time. The app can also take into account the long term acclimatization to caffeine that can occur with drinking coffee over days, weeks, or months that can require the user to drink more coffee to reach the same level of mental acuity. Grinding 206 , 207 steps can be performed by the integrated beverage system 500 and can include the disclosure of the Grinding 106 step described with reference to FIG. 2. The integrated beverage system 500 can include any suitable grinder system 504 that can grind the roasted beans into any suitably sized particles. The grinder system 504 can accept the roasted beans from the trap door 426 . The grinder system 504 can include a body 506 , a motor 508 , a grain-size filter 510 , and a chute 512 that can convey roasted grounds to the brewing system 430 . The average particle size can vary, for example, from between about 10 microns to about 2000 microns. An electrically powered grinder can be adjustable to a desired particle size. The grinder system 504 can include a blade grinder, a burr grinder, a disc burr grinder, a conical burr grinder, ultrasonic grinder, wet grinder, mortar and pestle grinder, or any other grinder. The grinder system 504 can be configured to produce a uniform particle size or particles having varying sizes. Grinding time can be from about 1 second to about 10 seconds, from about 10 second to about 30 seconds, from about 30 second to about 60 seconds, from about 60 second to about 120 seconds, or for greater than 120 seconds. The grinder system 504 can also be adaptively controlled such that the mechanical adjustment of grind size can be determined by the degree of roasting of the coffee beans performed in the integrated beverage system 500 . The fracture mechanics of coffee beans in the grinder system 504 can depend on the degree of roasting such that darker roasts may fracture to finer particles than lighter roasts even when the mechanics of the grinder remain unchanged. It may be valuable to adjust grinder system 504 mechanics based on information about the degree of coffee bean roasting. In an example embodiment, after Roasting 212 , 214 , the integrated beverage system 500 can automatically move the roasted beans from the roasting stage to the grinder system 504 using gravity or active transportation. After Grinding 206 , 207 , the integrated beverage system can automatically move the grounds to the brewing system 430 . In an alternate embodiment, as will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 8, after Roasting 212 , 214 , an integrated beverage system 700 can move a grinding tool 718 that can be associated with Grinding 206 , 207 into proximity with roasted beans. After the beans are ground, the integrated beverage system 700 can move the equipment or components associated with Brewing 214 , 215 into proximity with the roasted grounds. It will be appreciated that the beans and/or grounds can remain in substantially the same location, where the integrated beverage system 700 can move, rotate, or otherwise bring the tools associated with the Method 200 into proximity with the beans or grounds. In an alternate embodiment, the tools associated with the steps of the Method 200 can remain substantially stationary and the beans or grounds can be moved or otherwise transitioned between various stations. Grinding 206 , 207 steps can include sensors such as optical sensors to visually monitor grind size, a vibration sensor (e.g., accelerometer) that can monitor progress of grinding, or a microphone that can measure noise from the grinder to determine grind size. The grind process makes audible noise, where it may be possible to use active noise canceling techniques along with an embedded audio speaker to mute or minimize the noise generated by the grinder. Similarly, other process steps such as roasting or brewing may make audible noise that can be minimized by active noise canceling methods. The Method 200 can include Brewing 214 , 215 , which can include the disclosure of Brewing 114 described with reference to FIG. 2, and Dispensing 216 , 217 , which can include the disclosure of Dispensing 116 described with reference to FIG. 2. Brewing 214 , 215 can include sensors 452 (FIG. 5) such as a sensor for water temperature, water pressure, water pH, optical absorption, optical color sensor, optical light scattering, optical polarization to measure coffee extraction from the grind, a refractometer that can measure coffee extraction, a surface plasmon resonance (spr) sensor that can measure other chemical parameters of brewing, or other chemical sensors. Referring to FIG. 23, an integrated beverage system 1500 can be used in accordance with a roasting, grinding, and brewing system, such as described for example in with respect to Method 200 . The integrated beverage system 1500 can have any suitable elements, or features, such as those described in association with the integrated beverage system 500 . Roasting can include roasting of coffee beans in single serve portions with the green coffee beans provided in small pods. The roasting, grinding, and brewing processes can include features and steps as described herein. Green coffee beans can be provided in a container or pod 1502 , where the pod 1502 can be inserted into the integrated beverage system 1500 . In one embodiment, the pod 1502 can be inserted into a rotatable pod holder 1506 . The lid 1504 (FIG. 22) of the pod 1502 can be removed manually by the user or by the integrated beverage system. The lid 1504 can be punctured, torn, peeled, or otherwise opened or accessed. The pod 1502 may be able to hold up to 25 grams of green coffee beans and the grinds from 25 grams of roasted coffee. The pod 1502 can be about 1.375×1.375×2.375 inches in size. The pod can include compostable/biodegradable material. Brewing may occur in the pod 1502 so the material may be such that it can tolerate 100C water for approx 1 minute or more. The pod material may be transparent or opaque and, if opaque, any suitable color or combination of colors is contemplated. The pod can be sealed and airtight. The bottom of the pod 1502 may have a coffee filter integrated into it, where the filter may be a part of the pod (e.g., perforations, etc) or a separate filter paper material attached to the pod. The bottom of pod may be perforated during insertion into the machine or other action of the machine to create or expose the filter paper material. The top of the pod 1502 may be sealed initially, but may need to be opened by the system to allow green beans to exit the pod and allow the ground coffee to be inserted back into pod for brewing. The user may remove the lid of the pod before insertion into the machine, or this may be done automatically. The outside of the pod 1502 may be printed with ink. Markings may include corporate branding, name of bean, etc. An information code (bar code, QR code, etc) may be printed such that the machine can read when the pod is inserted into machine. Visible or invisible security markings may be on the pod to identify authentic pods and prevent third party pods from being used in the machine (RFID or similar may be used if cost is low enough and the materials are compostable). Also the same system may prevent previously used pods from being re-used in the machine. The machine may mark the pod as previously used or record unique serial numbers in a database system and check such a database to prevent re-use. As shown in FIG. 24, to transfer the green beans from the pod 1502 to a roaster 1524 the pod can be rotated after being opened or punctured. The pod 1502 can be rotated by the pod holder 1506 using a servo or any other suitable mechanism. This may be performed by a Hitec HS311 servo (180 degree rotation) controlled by a Raspberry Pi, for example. The central axis of the pod holder 1506 can be offset from the central axis of the roaster 1524 such that the pod holder 1506 need not rotate a full 180 degrees to dispense beans into the roaster 1524 . The pod holder 1506 can have any suitable range of rotation such as, for example, from about 90 degrees to about 180 degrees, from about 120 degrees to about 165 degrees, or from about 150 degrees to about 170 degrees. As illustrated the roaster 1524 can positioned at about the bottom of the integrated beverage system 1500 . The roaster may be the heaviest of the integrated components and it may be beneficial for the system 1500 to have a low center of gravity. Once the green beans have been introduced into the roaster 1524 they can be roasted in accordance with methods described herein. In particular, a fan (FIGS. 30 and 31) can be associated with the roaster and can be used to facilitate substantially uniform roasting of the beans. The roaster 1524 may include hot air blown by a fan into a small roast. An AC heater element may be a custom part or an off-the-shelf component. The heater may have over-temp protection and other thermal protection (e.g., thermal diode, bimetallic strip protection, etc.). The heater may consume a maximum of 1250 Watts, a maximum of up to 1500 Watts, or the limit can be the highest power available from a single phase AC power socket, for example. The fan may be a counter rotating fan for high air pressure from Sanyo Denki. The fan may have PWM speed control and RPM tachometer measurement. The roast chamber may have an approximately 2.8 inch tall cone, about 1.5 inch diameter at bottom, and about 3.5 diameter at the top, where other dimensions and designs are contemplated. The roaster 1524 may be thermally insulated to minimize heat loss. The top of the roaster 1524 may have three ports, for example, including green bean loading, exhaust air during roasting, and a roasted bean blowout tube. The exhaust and blowout tubes can be stainless steel having an OD of about 0.875 inches. There may be a moving door on top of the roaster 1524 that opens the appropriate ports during the cycle in the current prototype, which can be actuated by a linear actuator. The roaster 1524 may have a deflector plate that deflects beans out of roaster 1524 and to the grinder 1512 when the roast is completed and the fan may be operated at higher speed (up to 100% fan speed, for example). The roaster 1524 may operate up to about a 250C temperature or higher, where parts can be designed to operate at least at about 300C to provide a safety margin. In one embodiment it may be beneficial to be able to easily disassemble and replace roaster 1524 pieces as needed (simple fittings, screws, etc). A type K thermocouple may be used to measure the temperature in the roast chamber. The roaster 1524 may have a microphone nearby or attached to it to monitor the sounds of roasting (sounds of spinning beans, first crack, second crack, and other sounds) and provide feedback control to the roast algorithm; in addition other sensors such as cameras, laser reflection measurement, humidity, accelerometers may be used to monitor the state of the beans in the roaster and provide feedback to algorithms for roasting. The roast air exhaust port may be about 250C hot air exiting (typical roaster operating time may be up to 3 minutes or less, for example). One design to cool this hot air may be by routing it thru the water reservoir or boiler to reduce the exhaust temperature and simultaneously pre-heat the water (use of heat exchanger may help with this) as described herein. The exhaust port may have chaff exiting that comes off the green beans. This chaff may need to be collected and disposed of—typical collection may be a mesh screen or cyclonic separator of some sort. This chaff is harmless and tasteless and actually may be directed into the grinder after the roast is finished to be expelled into the pod. There may be smoke in the air exhaust and a smoke filter may be desirable such as, for example, simple carbon/charcoal filter, HEPA filter, etc. The filter may also be used to adjust or control the aroma exiting the machine. Reducing the air temperature of the exhaust by water heat recovery may allow simple standard filters to be used. In some cases for a commercial machine, for example, the exhaust air may be vented to an external fan or system to blow out of the room/building. The roast exhaust port may have a smoke detector in the path to detect smoke and control/stop roasting as a safety measure. Other emission/air sensors may also be included to monitor the state of the roast or for safety measures. Referring back to FIG. 23, once the roasting process has been completed the roasted beans can be blown out of the roaster by increasing the fan speed. The roasted beans can follow a bean path 1508 , where after leaving the roaster 1524 the beans can be ejected through a blowout tube 1510 and into a grinder 1512 that can be positioned substantially above the pod 1502 . It will be appreciated that the grinder can include any suitable grinder mechanism such as those described herein. The pod 1502 can be rotated via the pod holder 1506 back to its original upright position underneath the grinder 1512 with the top or lid 1504 open, punctured, or the like. The grinder 1512 can be operated and the grinds can fall back into the pod 1502 through the opened lid 1504 . The grinder 1512 can include a conical burr grinder that runs from a 120V AC motor, but other grinders are contemplated. The grinder fineness setting may be manually set and left in one position or can be varied. Embodiments can provide the ability to manually adjust the fineness setting. The grinder can consumes about 100 Watts AC and can be turned on/off via solid state relay controlled by a Raspberry Pi, for example. The grinder can be computer controlled so that the grind size can be controlled by computer software. Once the roasted grounds are positioned within the pod 1502 , a water injection system 1514 can mate to the pod 1502 and can inject hot water into the pod 1502 to brew the coffee. The bottom of the pod 1502 can contain a filtering mechanism 1516 such that the brewed coffee can exit the bottom of the pod 1502 into a user's cup. Such a system can use the pod 1502 for multiple steps in the brewing method where the pod can 1502 can serve to retain the unroasted beans as well as the brewing container for the roasted grounds. Providing the pod 1502 with multiple functions may also reduce the size of the integrated beverage system 1500 as fewer system components may be needed to achieve the desired result. It will be appreciated that the brewing process using the pod 1502 may introduce more water into the pod 1502 than the volume of the pod 1502 can initially accept. The pod 1502 can be expandable in dimension to allow more water to be injected into the pod during brewing. Such mechanisms of expansion can include accordion folding, origami folding, a flexible balloon-like material for pod, or the like. Air or water may be injected into the pod 1502 to cause such an expansion to occur, or mechanical mechanisms may be used to stretch or expand the pod. A potential benefit of expanding the pod only during the brewing stage is that the pod can be kept relatively small in size for packaging, but expand to allow more volume of water to be contained within the pod during brewing. In an alternative embodiment, the pod 1502 can mate to a fixed container (not shown) that is part of the system 1500 . This fixed container can create extra volume for the brewing operation and the hot water for brewing can be injected from the top of the fixed container. The filter 1516 can still be at the bottom of the pod 1502 in such a version and the finished coffee product (or other suitable beverage) can come out of the bottom of the pod. The fixed container may be made of nonstick material or other hydrophobic or superhydrophobic materials to prevent the residue of brewing from sticking to the container to make cleaning easier. Water can also be injected into the fixed container to aid in cleaning in a swirling pattern. In an alternate embodiment, as shown in FIG. 29, a two-piece or modular system 1950 can be provided. A first portion 1952 can contain green beans and a second portion 1894 , which can be removed from the first portion 1952 , can be a brewing/filtering portion for brewing that captures the spent grinds and houses the filter. The two pieces may be inserted into the same portion of the machine or into separate parts of the machine, for example. It will be appreciated that any suitable modular features for the pod or container are contemplated. A two-cavity pod concept can provide green coffee beans in the lower portion, where the top portion is empty and fills with coffee grinds after the grinding process. A middle separation layer of filter paper can be provided. The top and bottom of the pod can be sealed to prevent contents from falling out, where these seals can be removed by the system or by the end user. Variations of this concept are contemplated where the two cavities may separate, slide, or disconnect in different ways to allow the green beans to be extracted. In some cases the green beans may be in the top cavity and the bottom cavity may be empty. Any suitable number of cavities is contemplated. The pod 1502 can incorporate any suitable features to aid in the brewing process. These may be mechanical features incorporated into the body or lid of the pod 1502 and/or inserts (not shown) into the pod 1502 that can aid the mixture of the hot water with the grinds to facilitate even mixing or faster extraction of the drink from the solid grounds. Such features or elements can include spirals, nozzles, helix, ridges, dimples, protrusions, or other features that may enhance the mixture of water and grinds. Such features in the pod may direct water in specific patterns to enhance brewing extraction. The brewing process may also include multiple steps in which a subset quantity of the total quantity of water can be injected into the pod and brewing extraction allowed to occur, where this water can then be forced out of the pod via air injection or any other suitable method. Additional water that may be a subset of the total drink amount can then be injected into the pod, where this water can interact with the grinds (or other drink mixture in the pod) and ejected. This process can continue until the total amount of water is consumed or a desired amount of finished drink is expelled. This process can occur with each subset quantity of water being different. For example, each subset quantity amount may be different such as 1 ounce, 2.2 ounces, 3 ounces, or any other fractional numbers less than the total amount desired. The temperature or pressure of water injection can be different in each subset water injection step as well. The brew interaction time of each subset water injection step may be different. For example, the first subset injection step may be for 10 seconds or any other time and the second subset injection step may be for 14 seconds or any other time. Referring to FIG. 42, integrated beverage system 1500 can have a water system 2600 . The water system can include a refillable reservoir water tank. The water tank may be removable from the machine to refill, or can be refilled by pouring water into an external port on the machine. The reservoir may be about 45 ounces or larger, for example. A magnetic float/hall sensor in the water reservoir may be used to determine low water level. The water system 2600 may include a water pump, boiler, air pump, and solenoid valve. The boiler may have level sensors to sense 6, 8, and 10 ounces of water, or any other suitable water levels. The boiler may consume a maximum of 1500 Watts when on (single phase standard household circuit for the US; in other settings higher power consumption is acceptable), for example. The water pump, air pump, and solenoid may operate from 12V DC, for example. The boiler can have a thermistor to measure temperature. The maximum temperature of the boiler may be 100C, for example, but any temperature is contemplated. The boiler may have over-temperature thermal cutoff built in. The pod may be sealed up to 5 psi for brewing, for example, or higher pressure. For home use the water reservoir can be manually refilled. For commercial system, the water may be plumbed in. Referring to FIG. 43, integrated beverage system 1500 can have any suitable electrical configuration 2700 . The system 1500 can plug into a standard single phase 120V US household outlet. Maximum power consumption may be 1500 Watts, for example. The system can operate over a voltage range of 110V to 130V, or wider voltage range if desirable. The AC power into the system may be voltage stabilized to a fixed voltage level. The ambient temperature in the case in the vicinity of the electronics may be a maximum of 40C or less during operation, for example. The system 1500 may be controlled by a Raspberry Pi or equivalent running Linux. The primary components of the electrical system can include AC power distribution within the box, a 12V DC power brick, a Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi dongle (and possibly a Bluetooth dongle), a daughterboard for the Raspberry Pi for I/O machine control, and AC solid state relays: 2 high power (1500 Watts each) for roast heater and water heater control; 1 low power AC relay for grinder control, for example. In alternative embodiments, the pod 1502 can contain extra flavorings, such as chocolate, hazelnut, or the like, and these flavoring can be extracted into the water during the brew process and exit the pod via the filter into the cup. The flavorings can remain at ambient temperature conditions in such embodiments and flavorings may be liquid, powder, or any suitable form. The flavorings can be contained in a water soluble pouch (not shown) within the pod and/or be attached to the inside of pod in some way, or embedded in the pod material, for example. It will be appreciated that any suitable mechanism can be incorporated into the system 1500 to transfer or extract the green beans from the pod or container. For example, referring to FIG. 25, a vacuum or suction 1518 can be used to direct the beans into the roaster 2024 . Alternatively, the original pod may be punctured or a lid may be removed in some way, such as by sliding, such that the green beans may be blown out of the pod by air via a fan or the like. It will be appreciated that the integrated beverage system 1500 may have any suitable casing or housing 2800 as shown in FIG. 44. The system 1500 may be kitchen countertop size. The target dimension of the system 1500 may be maximum 12×12 inch footprint and 12 inches in height, but larger or smaller sizes are contemplated. The housing 2800 may be ventilated to prevent excess heat buildup in the machine, where this may be through a combination of vents, louvers, fans, or the like. The external sound created by the system 1500 can be dampened. Embodiment of the system 1500 may have microphones for listening to user commands and/or listening to sounds within the machine for diagnostics and maintenance notification. The grinder sound may be actively noise cancelled. The external housing 2800 of the system 1500 may be brushed stainless steel or any other suitable material, such as materials that can tolerate heat. It may be preferable to have the case be partially removable to access parts inside the machine without the need to completely remove the entire housing 2800 . The system can have any suitable user interface, where the system 1500 may have a power on/off switch, a CPU hard reset switch, a USB cable port connected to a Raspberry Pi, or any other suitable connection points. The machine may have indicator lights such as “power on”, “Wi-Fi connected”, and an operating indicator light when making coffee. In embodiments where a user inserts a pod into the machine a door is contemplated that opens/closes to allow this. The rotating pod holder 1506 may have a cam that pushes open a spring loaded door to allow pod insertion. All the controls of the machine may be via wireless connection. The machine may also have a port for water to be filled into the reservoir. In one embodiment, a minimal user interface is incorporated into the system 1500 for some simple functions, where more complex functions may be via an app over wireless connection. An example version of the system 1500 is shown in FIGS. 45A-C. Referring to FIGS. 28A-28C, one version of a pod 1802 is shown having a body 1805 and a rotatable sleeve 1807 . FIG. 28A illustrates the pod 1802 in a “closed” position, where a first aperture 1809 defined by the sleeve 1807 is closed by the body 1805 of the pod 1802 . FIG. 28B illustrates the pod 1802 in a partially open position, where the first aperture 1809 is partially aligned with a second aperture 1811 defined by the body 1805 . FIG. 28C illustrates the pod 1802 in an “open” position, where the first aperture and the second aperture are substantially aligned. In the “closed” position beans may be prevented from exiting the pod 1802 , but in the “open” position beans may be able to pass through the first aperture 1809 and the second aperture 1811 . The sleeve 1807 can be rotatable relative to the body 1805 in any suitable fashion and the rotation to remove the beans can occur manually, mechanically, and/or automatically with an integrated beverage system. Referring to FIG. 26, an alternate embodiment of an integrated beverage system 1600 is shown. It will be appreciated that any suitable method, mechanism, or orientation of stacking functionality is contemplated. As illustrated, a container 1602 containing unroasted beans can be opened or access such that beans can be introduce into a roaster 1624 . The roasted beans can then be introduced into a grinder 1612 . In the illustrated example, after the beans in the container 1602 have been emptied, the container 1602 can be transitioned from above the roaster 1624 into a brewing position below the grinder 1612 . The container 1602 can manually be moved from the first position to the second brewing position, or the container 1602 can be automatically transitioned to the second positioned with a robotic arm or the like. In this manner, the container 1602 can be used to retain the green coffee beans during storage and also to function as a brewing receptacle for the roasted coffee grounds. Referring to FIG. 27, an integrated beverage system 1700 can be used in accordance with a roasting, grinding, and brewing system, such as described for example in with respect to Method 200 . The integrated beverage system 1700 can have any suitable elements, or features, such as those described in association with the integrated beverage system 500 . Roasting can include roasting of coffee beans in single serve portions with the green coffee beans provided in small pods. The roasting, grinding, and brewing processes can include features and steps as described herein. Green coffee beans can be provided in a container or pod 1702 , where the pod 1702 can be inserted into the integrated beverage system 1700 . In one embodiment, the pod 1702 can be inserted into a rotatable pod holder 1706 . The lid 1704 of the pod 1702 can be removed manually by the user or by the integrated beverage system. The lid can be punctured, torn, peeled, or otherwise opened or accessed. To transfer the green beans from the pod 1702 to a roaster 1724 , the pod 1702 can be rotated after being opened or punctured. The pod 1702 can be rotated by the pod holder 1706 using a servo or any other suitable mechanism. The central axis of the pod holder 1506 can be offset from the central axis of the roaster 1724 such that the pod holder 1706 need not rotate a full 180 degrees to dispense beans into the roaster 1724 . The pod holder 1706 can have any suitable range of rotation such as, for example, from about 90 degrees to about 180 degrees, from about 120 degrees to about 165 degrees, or from about 150 degrees to about 170 degrees. The integrated beverage system 1700 can include a multi-function rotating actuator 1708 . In a first position, the actuator 1708 can be positioned substantially above the roaster 1724 , which can be positioned at about the bottom of the integrated beverage system 1700 . An access door 1711 can be slidably coupled with the actuator 1708 such that, in a first position as shown in FIG. 17, the access door 1711 is in an “open” position to accept the coffee beans from the pod 1702 into the roaster 1724 . Once the beans have been introduced into the roaster 1724 the actuator 1708 can rotate clockwise to a second position to simultaneous close the access door 1711 and align an exhaust tube and/or blowout tube 1709 with the roaster 1724 . During the roasting process exhaust can pass through the tube 1709 and, at the completion of the roasting process, the roasted beans can be blown vertically through the tube 1709 with a fan (not shown), for example. The roasted beans can be blown via any suitable tubing (not shown) or bean path into a grinder 1712 that can be positioned above the pod 1702 and pod holder 1706 . The grinder 1712 can then grind the beans in accordance with versions described herein. Following the grinding of the beans, the coffee grounds can enter the pod 1702 , which has been returned to a substantially vertical position. The actuator 1708 can rotate clockwise to a third position such that a linkage 1710 associated with the actuator 1708 horizontally urges a brew plate 1714 having a water path (not shown) into position below the grinder 1712 . The coffee grounds in the pod 1702 can then be brewed such that finished coffee is able to pass through a filter 1716 positioned in the bottom of the container 1702 . Such a system can use the pod 1702 for multiple steps in the brewing method where the pod can 1702 can serve to retain the unroasted beans as well as the brewing container for the roasted grounds. Providing the pod 1702 with multiple functions may reduce the size of the integrated beverage system 1700 as fewer system components may be needed to achieve the desired result. It will be appreciated that the actuator 1708 can transition between any suitable number of positions or stages. For example, an exhaust position may be different from a bean blowout position, where it may desirable to have the exhaust exit through a different path from the roasted beans. Referring to FIG. 30, a schematic of a single fan system 2000 is shown that can be used with the integrated beverage system 1700 and/or any other system described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, a single fan 1734 can be provided that is operatively coupled to both the pod 1702 to suction out the green coffee beans and the roaster 1724 to eject the exhaust via an exhaust port 1730 and a bean blowout tube 1732 . The fan 1734 can be associated with a flap or valve 1736 to facilitate the single fan functioning both to vacuum and to eject coffee beans during different stages of operation. A chaff/cyclone stage may be in one of two positions, or may have two such devices as may be desirable. Referring to FIG. 31, a schematic of a dual fan system 2100 is shown that can be used with the integrated beverage system 1700 and/or any other system described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, a first fan 1738 can be provided that is operatively coupled to both the pod 1702 to suction out the green coffee beans. A second fan 1740 can be provided that is coupled with the roaster 1724 to eject the exhaust via an exhaust port 1730 and a bean blowout tube 1732 . It will be appreciated that any suitable fan and/or valve arrangement is contemplated. FIGS. 32A and 32B illustrate one version of a spring-loaded brewing plate 1714 that can be used to seal a pod 1702 such that water within the pod 1702 can be pressurized to control brewing time and/or interaction time with coffee grounds. The grinder 1712 can include a fixed horizontal plate 1760 defining an aperture 1762 through which roasted coffee grounds can pass. The brewing plate 1714 can include a plurality of springs 1764 can that couple the fixed horizontal plate 1760 to the brewing plate. The brewing plate 1714 can include a water line 1766 to deliver heated water for the brewing process. Referring to FIG. 32A, the brewing plate 1714 can be in a first position adjacent or proximate the horizontal plate 1760 , where a laterally slidable wedge 1770 is provide that is not yet engaged with the brewing plate 1714 . In this first position the can be sufficient overhead space between the pod 1702 and the brewing plate 1714 that the pod 1702 can be easily rotated to dispose of the green beans contained therein. With reference to FIG. 32B, as described herein, the pod 1702 can be used both to retain the green coffee beans and to brew the roasted coffee grounds. Prior to the brewing process the pod 1702 can be rotated back to a substantially vertical position. The wedge 1770 can be laterally translated between the brewing plate 1714 and the fixed horizontal plate 1760 . Because the brew plate 1714 may be attached to the horizontal fixed plate only by the plurality of springs 1764 , the brew plate 1714 can be urged downward as the wedge 1770 is engaged. As shown in FIG. 32B, when the wedge 1770 is in the brewing position the brew plate 1714 can be fully expanded such that the brew plate can seal the pod 1702 . When the pod is sealed in this fashion water entering via the water line 1766 can pressurize the pod 1702 to improve control over the brewing process. FIGS. 33A and 33B illustrate one version of a “drawbridge” brewing plate 1714 that can be used to seal a pod 1702 such that water within the pod 1702 can be pressurized to control brewing time and/or interaction time with coffee grounds. The grinder 1712 can include a fixed horizontal plate 1760 defining an aperture 1762 through which roasted coffee grounds can pass. The brewing plate 1714 can include a first hinged portion 1772 and a second hinged portion 1774 , where the hinge portions can transition between a first position (FIG. 33A) and a second position (FIG. 33B). The hinged portions 1772 , 1774 can be coupled to the fixed horizontal plate 1760 with rigid rods 1776 . The hinged portions 1772 , 1774 of the brewing plate 1714 can include a water line 1766 to deliver heated water for the brewing process. Referring to FIG. 28A, the brewing plate 1714 is shown in a first position where the hinged portions 1772 , 1774 are raised such that there is sufficient overhead space between the pod 1702 and the brewing plate 1714 that the pod 1702 can be easily rotated to dispose of the green beans contained therein. With reference to FIG. 33B, prior to the brewing process the pod 1702 can be rotated back to a substantially vertical position. The hinged portions 1772 , 1774 can be urged downward such that they are substantially parallel with the fixed horizontal plate 1760 . As shown in FIG. 33B, when the brew plate 1714 is in the brewing position it can seal the pod 1702 . When the pod is sealed in this manner water entering via the water line 1766 can pressurize the pod 1702 to improve control over the brewing process. FIG. 34 illustrates one example of the relationship between the grinder 1712 and the brew plate 1714 . Referring to FIG. 35, it may be beneficial to utilize the heat from the roasting process in other applications of coffee preparation. For example, heat from the roaster exhaust (e.g., exhaust 1720 ) can be directed through a heat exchanger in the water reservoir or boiler to extract heat from the hot air stream such that this can be used to heat water that may be used to make coffee. The heat exchanger may in some cases have the features of a cyclonic separator in order to separate chaff from the exhaust air path. The heat exchanger may also serve to reduce the air temperature of the exhaust so that it can be vented into the room with less ambient heating if desired. In a boiler configuration, the boiler can be a hybrid configuration where liquid may be heated with exhaust air and also a heating element (such as an electric heating element). Such embodiments may allow more rapid heating of water and reduce energy consumption of machine operation. In an alternate embodiment the hot air may be directed to a thermoelectric generator to turn the waste heat into electric power. Conventional boilers for home appliances are not designed for multiple energy input sources which this new design allows. This may allow for faster water heating or more energy efficient liquid heating. FIG. 36 illustrates an example system for the removal of chaff. Chaff that exits the roast chamber (e.g., roaster 1712 ) may be directed to a chaff collection/separation mechanism. This system may direct the chaff back into the pod. In another approach, the system may direct chaff into the grinder and then into the pod again. In this way, a separate chaff collection box may not need to be provided and serviced by the user since the chaff can be returned to the pod with spent grinds to be removed after a cup of coffee is made. This may simplify machine operation and maintenance for the user. Referring to FIGS. 37 and 38, roasting coffee beans quickly and uniformly, such as in a roaster 1724 as shown herein, can benefit from even convective hot air flow. Embodiments herein can incorporate an air distribution device associated with a fan or turbo compressor wheel 2204 as shown. This wheel 2204 may be attached to a pipe 2202 with hot air coming down, where the wheel can create a spinning vortex flow of air that serves to agitate, spin, and/or heat the beans in the surrounding roast chamber. The heat can be produced by a heating coil in the pipe 2202 or in any other suitable manner. The beans may undergo a complex spinning/rolling/tumbling motion that enables fast, uniform roasting. Another advantage of this approach may be that the heat may be applied from the center of the roast chamber, such as roaster 1724 , which allows the perimeter of the chamber to be made with low cost materials (metals or high temperature glass that allows the roast process to be visibly viewed, where the low cost materials may need very little processing to form to shape). Other similar air ducting/flow structures can be used in similar way to create desired air motion to agitate the beans. An advantage of this approach may be that hot air may be brought in from the top and roasted beans can drop via gravity through a door in the bottom of the roaster to the next process step (the heat may also be brought in from the bottom of the roaster if desired). The heat in this case may be brought in from the center of the roaster which may allow the perimeter container to be solid and without any features needed, and allows the use of low cost simple glass for the perimeter if there is a desire to see inside the roaster. The perimeter container can also have features to improve agitation or bean mixing if desired and may be of other materials than glass. With reference to FIG. 39, a fan blade 2302 may also be used. Referring to FIG. 40, one example of an integrated beverage system 2400 is shown having roasting, grinding, and brewing functions. The beans can be inserted into the clear container at top of the system 2400 . The beans can fall into a roaster via a computer controlled door. The beans can be roasted. The beans can fall into a grinder via a computer controlled door. The grinds can fall into the brew chamber at the bottom of the system 2400 (white bottomed container). The chamber can be sealed and hot water can be injected to brew the coffee. This is an example of a full immersion brewer and the coffee grounds/water mixture can be agitated/mixed to the desired level by bubbling air through the chamber. The chamber can be pressurized which can push the coffee out of the chamber through a pressure relief check valve. The brewed coffee can be seen in the small carafe on lower right side of FIG. 40. Referring to FIG. 41, an alternate approach to roasting may be a horizontal cylinder configuration with the air entering the roaster 2500 lateral to the cylinder and beans spinning up and around the cylinder. Gravity may cause the beans to fall back down and catch the input air repeatedly. Variations are contemplated in which the air input and output can be varied around the circular cylinder of the roaster 2500 . Referring to FIG. 46, in an alternate embodiment a container or pod 2902 can include a plurality of cavities. The cavities may contain green unroasted beans, roasted beans, partially roasted beans, or may be empty, for example. The material of the pod 2902 may be compostable/biodegradable, where the material may be designed to be “activated” to start the biodegradation process, where such activation can be via exposure to wavelengths of light, contact with materials or liquids, contact with gases, or the like. The exposure may occur in the integrated beverage system as part of the process and, thus, induce the beginning of bio-degradation. The exposure or activation may be delay such that the pod 2901 material may remain in shelf stable state during prior steps (packaging, storing, shipping, etc.) but then may degrade once the pod 2902 has been used. The pod 2902 and/or the lid of the pod may contain antibacterial/antimicrobial or other agents to kill and or prevent the growth of bacteria, viruses, mold, fungus, or the like. Such antimicrobial ingredients may be natural and may be embedded into the packaging such that they are not extracted into the water in brewing. Such a configuration may be used to keep the food contained inside safe for human consumption. Alternatively the pod 2902 or lid may have chemical or other markings that react with bacteria (molds, viruses, etc.) to change color or some other visual (or sensory) indicator to enable a user (or machine) to detect the presence of a pathogen to indicate that the pod 2902 should be discarded. In one example, the pod 2902 may contain a first cavity 2904 and a second cavity 2906 that are independent and have no pathway between them. Both cavities 2904 , 2906 may have a lid or seal that can be removed. One cavity may contain the food product, such as green coffee beans, and the second cavity may be empty. Both cavities may be sealed from the outside environment. The pod 2902 may be inserted into the machine (such as an integrated beverage system) and the lid for the food containing first cavity 2904 may be punctured or removed to allow the food product to be processed by the machine (the food product may be extracted from the pod 2902 ). The machine may perform the process and the lid or cover of the second cavity 2906 may be removed or punctured to allow the processed food product to enter this second cavity and further processing may be done. The use of multiple cavities can allow one cavity to be isolated and remain free of any contaminants from the original food product (if any contaminants do exist). The lid or seal of each cavity can be opened simultaneously or sequentially one after the other to isolate one cavity from the other if desired. The multi-cavity pod 2902 can have any physical orientation, where one cavity may be beside another cavity, one cavity may be on top of another cavity, and these concepts may be expanded to more than two cavities to any suitable number. The pod 2902 can have green beans in the first cavity 2904 and grounds in the second cavity 2906 . The second cavity 2906 with grounds could be empty when purchased and the machine may insert the grounds into this cavity for disposal. Referring to FIG. 47, an alternate approach to a roast, grind, and brew integrated beverage system 3000 is provided. In this case the pod may have multiple cavities one located above the other (E.g., FIG. 29). Both cavities may constitute one pod and can be delivered as a single unit with sealing on the top and bottom of the pod. The lower cavity of the pod may contain green unroasted beans and the upper cavity may be empty. The layer separating the two cavities may have some filtering material (paper, steel mesh, etc.). The lead line 3001 shows the example path of the coffee beans through the system 3000 . The green unroasted beans may fall into the roaster (the machine may automatically remove/puncture/etc the bottom seal to allow the beans to fall out into the roaster) and the beans may be roasted. The roasted beans may expand in size and lose weight during roasting so they can be easier to blow out. The roasting may be via convection and a fan and a heater coil may create the heat for convective heating. During roasting, the fan may be operated at a sufficient level to spin/agitate the beans but after roasting the fan may be operated at much higher speed to create enough air pressure to blow the beans out of the roast chamber. The roast chamber may have a mechanical feature to deflect the beans out of the roaster into a tube or pipe that directs the beans to the next step of processing. The beans may be directed to the inlet of a coffee grinder such as a burr grinder. The grinder may be situated so the grinds exit the grinder and fall back into the top portion of the pod (the top seal or lid of pod may have been removed by the user or by the system). A brewing mechanism may mate to the pod and hot water may be injected into the pod to brew the coffee. The resultant coffee may be filtered by the previously mentioned filter paper and coffee may exit the pod into the cup. The pod may contain the used grinds and there may be nothing to clean up for the end user. The pod may be removed from the machine and the pod may be made of compostable or biodegradable material. Note that the pod may originally contain roasted whole beans (in the location of the green unroasted beans mentioned previously) and the roast step may be skipped and the rest of the machine may be operated as described to make coffee. Alternatively, partially roasted beans can be in the pod and the remaining roasting can be done in the system. Other drink or food stuffs may be provided in the pod and the entire machine or parts of the process may be used to make any suitable food or drink. For example the pod may contain tea and the system may be used to make tea as one example. In this example, the tea may remain in the pod and may not be dumped into the roaster, where the tea may be in the lower or upper chamber of the pod when originally packaged. It is contemplated that a single system can have different configurations for use with different beverages such as, for example, both tea and coffee. FIG. 48 illustrates one embodiment of an integrated beverage system 3100 . It may be desirable to ship unroasted green coffee beans in a pod 3102 , to roast the beans within the pod 3102 , remove the beans for the roasting step, and then return the roasted grounds to the pod 3102 for brewing. The pod 3102 may contain the green unroasted coffee beans. The pod 3102 can be made of any suitable material that can tolerate the high temperature generally associated with roasting. For example the pod 3102 can be configured from metal foil or can have a foil lining. The pod 3102 can mate with the system 3100 and the lid of the pod 3102 can be punctured or removed. Hot air can be introduced to the pod 3102 so that the beans are roasted in the pod. The hot air can cook the beans and may also swirl or agitate the beans to cook via convection. When the roasting is finished, the roasted beans may be blown out of the pod 3102 such as with a fan 3114 (or removed in some other way such as inverting or mechanical removal) into the grinder 3112 . The grinder 3112 may be outside the pod 3102 and may be a conical burr grinder, flat burr grinder, spinning blade grinder, or any other grinder. The beans may be ground and the grinds may end up in the original pod 3102 . Referring to FIG. 49, after the grounds are returned to the pod 3102 the pod 3102 may be sealed and brewing may occur. An injector 3116 can pierce the pod 3102 to deliver water and a second penetration can be made with a second access port 3118 such that coffee may come out the bottom of pod. Various doors, seals and/or actuators may be involved at different times in the process to allow the steps to occur. Referring to FIGS. 50-57, embodiments of software applications to control the integrated beverage systems are disclosed. Integrated beverage systems in accordance with versions described herein may be internet connected and controlled by an application that can run on computer, laptop, smartphone, tablet, etc. Embodiments of the system can make coffee, cook, or otherwise provide a food product with a combination of hardware and software that can allow the end user to pick the desired flavor notes that they want, where the software can suggest the ingredients and the preparation recipe to create the desired flavors/tastes. The roast, grind, brew hardware system along with the choice of coffee bean type and specific recipe to make the coffee can allow desired flavors to be made. Very precise and accurate cooking hardware with closed loop feedback controls can allow for very high reproducibility. The beans may be characterized for taste/flavors by expert tasters beforehand and a database of recipes and flavors may be compiled. Statistical machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques can be utilized to interpret human commands and pick the most likely desired suggestion along with dynamic interpolation of flavors from predetermined recipes. A complex multidimensional space of recipe cooking parameters that can have forty or more variables can be used. One example of the software is shown in FIGS. 50-58. The user may pick 3 desired flavor notes (E.g., jasmine, orange, and bergamot as shown in FIG. 50) and the system can responds with four choices in the next screen (FIG. 51) leading with Guatemala Acatenango Gesha. The flavor notes for a particular coffee can be shown in an Aster plot (FIG. 52) as a wheel with dominant flavors shown graphically larger. A second example is shown with green pepper, earth, burned sugar (FIGS. 53 and 54). The flavors can change even for the same bean type but with different processing, where roast, grind, and brew can individually affect flavor notes (FIGS. 55-57). The app can also show the location origins of each bean on a world map and allow the user to virtually ‘fly over’ the location or learn more about the story of each particular bean type including the farmers growing the bean, growing conditions, weather, etc (FIG. 58). FIG. 59 illustrates one version of the architecture of machine hardware and software that can be associated with integrated beverage systems described herein. FIG. 60 illustrates an alternate version of architecture of machine hardware and software that can be associated with integrated beverage systems described herein. FIGS. 61A-D illustrate one embodiment of a pod system that can be used with versions of the integrated beverage systems described herein. FIGS. 62A and 62B illustrate an example design of an integrated beverage system with roast, grind, and brew functionality. In the illustrated embodiment, the roaster can be positioned on the top of the system, the grinder below that, and the brewing system below that. Such a configuration can allow gravity to feed the coffee beans between stages. Computer controlled doors between the stages can allow the beans to fall between stages at the desired time when the machine activates the door. It will be appreciated that the doors may also be manually controlled. FIG. 63 illustrates one embodiment of a roast, grind, and/or brew system that can include a canister with a built in spout for pouring/serving. The canister can include separate sections for easy cleaning. FIGS. 64A and 64B illustrate an alternate embodiment of an integrated beverage system that can roast, grind, and brew a beverage such as coffee. FIG. 65 illustrates an alternate embodiment of an integrated beverage system that can roast, grind, and brew a beverage such as coffee. FIGS. 66A and 66B disclose an alternate design for a roast, grind, and brew integrated beverage system. Embodiments can include the separation of active and passive components. The illustrated figures below show the ‘passive’ components, where there are no electrical connections to the parts shown. In certain embodiments only these parts of the machine touch the coffee in the raw green bean state, ground, or brewed state. The motors, pumps, water heater, air heater, and other components that are active can be separate where the system can be designed such that the passive coffee portion of the machine can be easily separated and removed from the active portion. Such a design can allow the passive coffee portion of the system to be easily removed and cleaned, repaired, and/or replaced as necessary. In one example, the entire passive portion may be one tube or similar structure that can be removed and, in an alternate version, the passive portion can be multiple modular pieces. Removable pieces could easily be put into a dishwasher for cleaning, which may be difficult with other designs. The roaster may have a tube that connects the heater air source that is modular and can be disconnected. The grinder may be driven by a belt or gear connected to a motor with the actual grinder being removable. The brewer may have a water tube connected to allow hot water entry. There may be multiple doors or the like that can control flow between sections of the machine that move in/out and are part of the active part of the machine though they control flow in the passive part of the machine (e.g., computer controlled doors). FIG. 67 discloses an alternate embodiment of an integrated beverage system that can provide a roast, grind, and/or brew functionality. Green beans may be loaded into the top of the machine, where the beans can be loaded via a pod that may be punctured and that drops the beans into a roaster, or the beans may be loose unpackaged beans that fall into the roaster in a controlled fashion such as a door opening. The system can include a roaster, a door under the roaster that opens and closes, and a grinder positioned under the roaster, where beans can fall into the grinder. The grinds can then fall into a brewer, which is under the grinder, in the illustrated embodiment. A door can open or close to allow grinds into the brewing system and/or to close and seal the brewer once the grinds are in position. Hot water can be injected into the brewer and coffee can come out of the bottom of the brewer into a cup. The system can include a replaceable/disposable filter that can catch the grinds and can be easily removed, cleaned, or disposed. This filter may be made of compostable material, for example. Referring to FIGS. 68A and 68B, one embodiment of an integrated beverage system 3200 is shown. It may be beneficial to provide a system that can automatically transition a container or pod 3202 between a plurality of different stations. For example, a pod 3202 can be placed into a loading station 3218 . Next, a servo motor 3220 associated with an arm 3218 can transition the pod 3202 to a roaster 3212 . Following the roasting step the servo motor 3220 can rotate the arm about an axis 3216 such that the pod 3202 is in position relative to a grinder and/or brewer system 3214 . In this manner a grinder, roaster, and/or brewer can be placed radially about the axis 3216 , which may decrease the space needed to accommodate the various functions of the integrated beverage system 3200 . It will be appreciated that any orientation of functions is contemplated and any mechanism of transitioning the pod 3202 is contemplated. Referring to FIGS. 71A-71C, it will be appreciated that any suitable embodiment of a system that can roast, grind, and/or brew inside of a container or pod is contemplated. In one embodiment, a pod 3302 can include slits in a perimeter surface that can allow hot air to enter, but these slits may be covered by a sleeve before the pod used. During use, the pod 3302 can be inserted into an automated beverage system and the sleeve can be raised to allow hot air to enter and roast the beans. The sleeve can then be lowered and a grinding tool can be lowered into the pod 3302 and can spin to grind the roasted beans. Hot water can be injected into the pod 3302 to brew the coffee and coffee can come out of the bottom of the pod after passing through filtering material, for example. Referring to FIGS. 72A and 72B, one embodiment of a system to roast, grind, and/or brew in a pod is shown. The top of the pod 3302 , or bottom of the tool 3304 in a system that can mate to the pod 3302 , can have airfoil features to create swirling air pattern that can directed into the pod. Hot air can be injected into the pod to roast the beans. The tool 3304 can also have a grinder tool that can lower into the pod 3302 that can grind the beans. The grinder tool can have blades that can be retracted into a narrow feature and expand as the blades spin due to centrifugal force, which may allow the insertion hole to be relatively small. The tool 3304 can also have a water injection port to allow hot water to enter the pod 3302 and brew the coffee. Coffee may exit the pod 3302 from the bottom of the pod 3302 which can have a filtration material. The pod 3302 can also have a blade material located permanently inside the pod 3302 , where this blade can be engaged by an external motor that spins the blade to grind the beans, for example. Referring to FIG. 73, one embodiment of system to roast, grind, and/or brew in a pod 3502 is shown. The pod 3502 can be a two section pod with one part on top of the other. The top part can contain green unroasted beans, where beans may be roasted in this top section via hot air injected via the perimeter or from the bottom. Alternatively, hot air can be injected from the top. After roasting, a grinding tool can be lowered into the pod 3502 and the grinds can fall into the lower section of the pod 3502 . Water can be injected into the pod 3502 from the top or sides and coffee may be brewed/filtered in the lower section of the pod 3502 . Coffee can come out of the bottom of pod. Referring to FIG. 74, an alternate approach may be to roast in a pod 3602 from the perimeter via hot air and a tool 3604 can be lowered into the pod 3602 to block off the perimeter holes and allow grinding and brewing in the pod 3602 . Brewing may occur in the pod 3602 and coffee can come out of the bottom of pod 3602 . In another variation of this and all the other designs discussed, the pod may have a metal blade embedded into the pod along with a mating feature that allows an external motor to engage with the blade and spin the blade to grind the beans (other hard materials can be used instead of metal for the blade/grinding mechanism). The mating feature can be a central shaft or other feature that may be inside the pod, in which case the external tool can enter the pod to mate, or may protrude outside of the pod. Referring to FIG. 75, an alternate approach to roasting, grinding, and brewing in a pod 3702 is shown. A tool 3704 can be lowered into the pod 3702 , which can contain unroasted green beans. The tool 3794 can have vents to allow hot air to enter the pod 3702 to roast the beans. The tool 3704 also may have a grind and brew component that can allow the beans to be ground and brewed after roasting. The use of radially tilted fins may allow the injected hot air to spin the beans. It will be appreciated that any suitable mesh configuration, such as a vertical mesh configuration, is contemplated. Referring to FIGS. 76A and 76B, an approach to providing a roast, grind, and brew functionality in a pod 3802 is shown. The tool 3804 can lower and mate to the pod 3802 , which can contain green unroasted coffee beans. The tool 3804 can have nozzles to inject hot air into the pod 3802 to roast the beans and may have exhaust ports for the hot air. The tool 3804 can have a spinning blade to grind the roasted beans. The tool 3804 can have water injection ports to inject hot water into the pod 3802 to brew the coffee. The coffee can be filtered in the bottom of the pod 3802 and may come out of the bottom. Referring to FIGS. 77A-77C, an approach to roasting, grinding, and brewing is shown. The pod may contain green coffee beans and can mate to the machine. The machine may rotate 180 degrees to dump the beans into the machine, which may roast the beans in a container. The machine can be rotated back 180 degrees and the roasted beans can fall back into the pod for grinding and brewing. Water can be injected into the pod and coffee may come out the bottom. Referring to FIG. 78, an alternate version with a wider pod is shown. FIGS. 79A and 79B illustrate one embodiment of a system that can facilitate grinding in a pod. Referring to FIGS. 80A-80C, an alternate approach to a roast, grind, and/or brew system is shown. The pod can contain green beans and the pod can mate to the machine. The machine can rotate to drop the beans into a roaster. The beans can be roasted. The machine can rotate to drop roasted beans back into the pod. A grinder can be lowered into the pod to grind the beans. The grinder can be a spinning blade grinder, burr grinder, or other grinder. The same tool with the grinder can inject water into the pod to brew coffee, where coffee may come out of the bottom of the pod after passing through a filtering material.

Description of Related Art Infectious diseases are one of the most important causes of health and pathological problems in the world. Studies have confirmed the presence of pathogens in human skin and that they are the source of many diseases. For example, in Saudi Arabia, S. epidermidis bacteria were isolated from the skin of patients and the skin of healthy people (Eladli, M. G., et al., 2019. Antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from patients and healthy students to compare with antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk. Saudi journal of biological sciences, 26(6), pp. 1285-1290). The spread of strains of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli bacteria has been proven in the wounds of patients in Saudi Arabia (Alharbi, N. S., et al. 2019). Prevalence of Escherichia coli strains resistance to antibiotics in wound infections and raw milk. Saudi journal of biological sciences, 26(7), pp. 1557-1562). In another study in Saudi Arabia, wounds were found to be the source of more than 40% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, known as MRSA (Almanaa, T.N., et al. 2020). The extreme drug resistance (XDR) Staphylococcus aureus strains among patients: A retrospective study. Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences, 27(8), pp. 1985-1992.). Plant preparations have been used to treat microbial infections for many decades (Redo, M. C., et al. (1989) ‘A review of some antimicrobial compounds isolated from medicinal plants reported in the literature 1978-1988’, Phytotherapy Research, 3(4), pp. 117-125. doi:10.1002/ptr.2650030402.) due to their therapeutic properties and chemical composition, which contains natural antimicrobials. The coffee drink is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and many studies have confirmed that the coffee drink has vital activity against a wide range of pathogenic microbes, for example, Rawangkan and others stated that by-products of coffee beans can inhibit drug-resistant Vibrio cholera bacteria. (Rawangkan, A., et al., 2022. Potential Antimicrobial Properties of Coffee Beans and Coffee By-Products Against Drug-Resistant Vibrio cholerae . Frontiers in nutrition, 9.) Phenolic compounds in general, caffeine, chlorogenic acid and trigonylene are some of the most famous compounds found in coffee ( Coffea arabica ), which has an inhibitory ability for microbes (Almeida, A. A. P. et al. (2006) ‘Antibacterial activity of coffee extracts and selected coffee chemical compounds against enterobacteria’, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 54(23), pp. 8738-8743. doi:10.1021/jf0617317.; Dai, J. and Mumper, R. J. (2010) ‘Plant phenolics: Extraction, analysis and their antioxidant and anticancer properties’, Molecules, 15(10), pp. 7313-7352. doi:10.3390/molecules15107313.). It was also found that caffeine has the ability to inhibit the production of certain mycotoxins and that it is effective against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Fardiaz, S. (1995) ‘Antimicrobial Activity of Coffee ( Coffea robusta ) Extract’, ASEAN Food Journal, 10(3), pp. 103-106.). Furthermore, studies have shown that coffee extracts have a role in inhibiting the replication of DNA viruses. There have been numerous attempts to strengthen surgical dressings with various materials that enhance their effectiveness, for example, in 2018, Ehterami and others supported surgical dressings with insulin-chitosan nanoparticles to support skin wound healing in animal models. (Ehterami, A., et al. 2018). In vitro and in vivo study of PCL/COLL wound dressing loaded with insulin-chitosan nanoparticles on cutaneous wound healing in rats model. International journal of biological macromolecules, 117, pp. 601-609.) Simões et al. (Simões, D., et al., 2018. Recent advances on antimicrobial wound dressing: A review. European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, 127, pp. 130-141.) confirmed that the pathogenicity and mortality rate associated with skin and soft tissue infections is high and wound dressings reinforced with antimicrobial agents are a viable way to reduce the risk of colonization of wounds by pathogenic microbes and improve healing rates. Thus, a clinical dressing loaded with coffee extract solving the aforementioned problems is desired. SUMMARY Wound pathogens are one of the serious health problems facing the world, including Saudi Arabia. This innovation aims to confront these microbes and inhibit their activity with a natural extract that is safe on the skin and on the human body generally. The aqueous extract of Saudi coffee roasted to different degrees and prepared in a manner appropriate to the method of preparing Saudi coffee proved to be effective in inhibiting methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and surgical dressings reinforced with coffee extract produced in this innovation are also effective against this pathogenic bacterium compared to those that were not supported by the Saudi coffee extract. Raw green Khulani coffee beans (sometimes also referred to as Khawlani Coffee Beans) were obtained from a local farm in Viva, Jazan, Saudi Arabia. These coffee beans were roasted in two different grades and the traditional Saudi coffee preparation method was simulated in the laboratory and an aqueous extract was produced from each. The resulting extracts were tested and demonstrated a strong inhibitory efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus growth. Medicinal dressings were supplemented with the extract, left to dry, kept for a whole month, tested during that time and proved their ability to inhibit MRSA in the ideal growth environment for bacteria, which means that they will be more effective if used directly on human skin. In an embodiment, a supplemented wound dressing may be made by a method including providing coffee beans, washing the coffee beans drying the coffee beans, grinding the coffee beans, mixing about 10 g of the coffee beans with about 100 mL sterile distilled water to obtain an aqueous solution, boiling the aqueous solution for about 15 minutes to obtain an extract, sterilizing the extract, providing a wound dressing, adding the sterilized extract to a wound contacting portion of the wound dressing, and drying the wound dressing under sterile conditions to obtain the supplemented wound dressing. In an embodiment, supplemented wound dressing prepared according to the present methods may be effective to inhibit bacterial growth, and in a particularly desirable embodiment the supplemented wound dressing prepared according to the present methods may be effective to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus when applied to the surface of a wound on a subject in need thereof. In an embodiment, methods of preventing bacterial growth in a subject in need thereof are provided, including preparing a supplemented wound dressing according to the present methods and applying the supplemented wound dressing to a wound on the subject in need thereof. The supplemented wound dressing may inhibit bacterial growth in the wound on the subject in need thereof, including particularly inhibiting the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. These and other features of the present subject matter will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification.

In an embodiment, the wound dressing used may be waterproof surgical bandages of the Nescare type. The present subject matter may be better understood by referring to the following Examples. Example 1 Preparation of Coffee Extracts The coffee beans were prepared for roasting by washing the beans with tap water, followed by air drying for a period of about wo hours, and roasting at desired temperatures using a Coffee Roaster (940W 5521/22/GY). The roasting conditions are listed in Table 1. In Table 1 *Ca indicates the use of cardamom, while non-Ca indicates that no Cardamom was added. Roasted and unroasted coffee beans were then ground by an AG-36/SI-557 type coffee grinder. TABLE 1 The conditions and ingredients used in roasting Khulani coffee samples Medium Roasted Light Roasted Unroasted Coffee Beans Coffee Beans Coffee Beans Treatment Cardamom *Ca Non-Ca *Ca Non-Ca *Ca Non-Ca Roasting Time (min) N/A 30 15 N/A Temperature Range N/A 230° C. 190° C. N/A Weight of ground 10 g 10 g + 10 g 10 g + 10 g 10 g + 10 g Coffee per 100 mL 2 g 2 g 2 g Distilled Water Boiling Time 15 minutes Traditional Saudi coffee was prepared in the laboratory under sterile environmental conditions to minimize microbial load contamination as much as possible. To prepare the samples without the addition of cardamom, 10 g of roasted (medium roasting and light roasting) and unroasted coffee beans were placed separately in glass bottles and thoroughly mixed with 100 mL of distilled boiling water, then the boiling process continued for 15 minutes. As for the samples to which cardamom was added, they were prepared as follows: mix 100 mL of distilled boiling water with 10 g of roasted (medium roasting and light roasting) and unroasted coffee (each treatment was prepared in separate glass vials). For each treatment separately add 2 g of crushed cardamom using a mortar and the samples were heated to a boil for 15 minutes. In all the processes, there is a mixture of an aqueous extract that includes coffee with different degrees of roasting without the addition of cardamom and another with the addition of cardamom, and all extracts have been treated with ultraviolet radiation according to the method (Rutala, W. A. and Weber, D. J. (2019) ‘Disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities’, Bennett & Brachman's Hospital Infections: Sixth Edition [Preprint], (May). doi:10.1017/9781107153165.009.). The obtained aqueous extracts were then sterilized by exposure to ultraviolet light for ten minutes. Example 2 Preparation of Wound Dressings Supplemented with Coffee Extracts Commercial surgical bandages (Nexcare, Poland) with a width of 25 mm and a length of 72 mm were used to produce wound dressings containing the aqueous extracts of Saudi coffee. The extracts were prepared as described in Example 1. In completely sterile conditions, 0.1 mL of the aqueous extract was added to the inner part of the surgical dressings that stick to the wounds. The dressings were allowed to dry completely at room temperature in entirely contamination-free circumstances. The effectiveness of dressings loaded with the aqueous extracts of Saudi coffee were tested against MRSA in vitro study. The loaded dressings' validity and capacity to maintain their effectiveness was tested for a full month. Example 3 Testing Antibacterial Activity of Coffee Extracts To test the effectiveness of previous extracts as antibiotic-resistant antibacterial agents, a standard strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300) bacteria, known simply as MRSA, was used in this investigation. The results of the standard antibiotic sensitivity test using the Vitek-2 system showed that this strain is resistant to the following antibiotics: imipenem, cefoxitin, ampicillin, penicillin G, oxacillin and amoxicillin-alavulanate. Standard methods were followed in the preparation of culture media used for cultivation of bacteria. The bacterial strain was cultivated at least three times before the assay to ensure their activity. The agar well diffusion method using Mueller-Hinton agar (Scharlab, S. L., Spain) was done according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (as reported previously by Hombach, M., et al., 2012. Effects of clinical breakpoint changes in CLSI guidelines 2010/2011 and EUCAST guidelines 2011 on antibiotic susceptibility test reporting of Gram-negative bacilli. Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy, 67(3), pp. 622-632.). The suspension of MRSA in a sterile saline physiological solution (0.89% table salt) was prepared from 24-hour-old bacterial colonies to obtain an optical density of 0.65 at 600 nm. The surfaces of Mueller-Hinton plates were inoculated with 0.1 mL of MRSA suspension. After that, standard wells with a diameter of 6 mm were drilled using a disposable sterile glass pipette. Saudi coffee preparations were added to the wells at a concentration of 40 mg/mL, the plates were incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours, after which the inhibition zone was recorded around each hole, which indicates the activity of the preparations against the tested bacteria. A modified process was used to test the Wound Dressing supplemented with coffee extracts. This modification included not etching the surface of the medium (agar) and instead, the preparation-loaded and non-loaded bandages were gently placed on the surface of the medium (agar) on which the bacterial vaccine was spread according to the above-mentioned standard steps. The biological activity of loaded bandages, after the incubation process at 37° C. for 24 hours, was estimated as an inhibition zone that appears around the preparation-loaded bandages and does not appear in non-loaded-bandages. The experiment continued to be repeated weekly for a whole month to make sure that the loaded bandage retains its effectiveness and that the compounds that adhered to it are stable and do not lose their effectiveness over time.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to processes for isolating and extracting antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from coffee cherries and antioxidant-rich products and compositions made from coffee cherries. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The fruit of the coffee plant (e.g., Coffea arabica ) is often called the “coffee cherry.” The coffee cherry is made up of the following layers (from the outside in): skin, pulp, mucilage, parchment, and bean. The skin, also referred to as the epicarp or exocarp, is a monocellular layer covered with a waxy substance ensuring protection of the fruit. The mesocarp includes the pulp and the mucilage. The pulp is the fleshy outer layer of the mesocarp, directly beneath the skin, which during processing can be removed with a pulping machine. The mucilage is the slimy layer found between the pulp and parchment, adhering to the parchment inside a coffee cherry. It is generally not removed by pulping. Mucilage is not present in unripe coffee fruit, and disappears in overripe coffee. The endocarp, or “parchment,” is the tough integument tightly pressed to the bean when fresh but from which the bean shrinks during drying. It lies between the fleshy part (or pulp) of the cherry and the silver skin. The endocarp also includes the thin, crumbly paper-like covering that is left on wet-processed coffee beans after pulping and fermentation, and which is subsequently removed during hulling. The bean includes the endosperm and the embryo. The endosperm includes the tissues that feed the embryo during germination. The embryo ultimately forms the coffee beans. The silver skin is the seminal integument covering the endosperm, i.e., the thin, papery, shiny layer immediately surrounding the coffee bean, being the remnant of the integument. During processing, milling before export removes most silver skin, and the remainder is removed during roasting in the form of chaff. The endosperm fills the integument as the coffee cherry ripens. The coffee cherry is harvested and processed to make coffee. During processing, the bean portion of the cherry is removed and further processed using various techniques. This processing generally removes the bean, silver skin and parchment. Thus, after the bean is removed, a significant amount of the coffee cherry fruit remains. Traditionally, the portion of the cherry remaining after the bean is removed is viewed as waste, although it is sometimes processed into compost or animal feed. However, this remaining portion has significant nutritive value. In particular, it is high in antioxidants and polyphenols, including chlorogenic acids of various types, caffeic acid, quinic acid, ferulic acid, proanthocyanidins, and others. These compounds have antioxidant activity, which can contribute to good heath by reducing oxidative injury and thus ameliorating associated disease states such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of cardiovascular and neurological conditions. The beneficial anti-oxidative and other properties of such compounds, as well as other beneficial components of the extracts, can also be used to treat other conditions such as skin disorders and the like. Isolating these antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from the de-beaned coffee cherry can be difficult, however. For example, coffee pulp contains high levels of tannins, which bind the protein and make it difficult to extract and precipitate. An additional problem is that the free phenols in coffee pulp become oxidized to quinones. Quinones are oxidizing agents that may oxidize amino acids in coffee cherry proteins. Also, ripe coffee fruit is used during husking, and exposure to oxygen, and also the activity of enzymes, sugars, and other components of the coffee cherries, can cause rapid degradation and/or oxidation of these compounds and rapid bacterial growth either prior to or during processing. These degradative processes can begin almost immediately following removal of the bean. As a result, currently available methods of isolating the beneficial components from coffee cherries have frequently resulted in poor yields and the presence of undesirable side-products. As such, there remains a need in the art for improved methods of isolating antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from coffee cherries and antioxidant-rich products and compositions made from coffee cherries. The present invention satisfies these needs and provides related advantages as well.

Introduction Human cells create “life energy” through oxidation processes; however, excessive oxidation can also cause cell damage. The human body has various systems of controlling oxidation in our cells by using antioxidants. However, because of factors resulting from our highly industrialized society-including pollution, radiation, stress, and our busy lifestyles-our bodies cannot eliminate oxidation as fast as it accumulates, causing a vast range of health issues. Reducing oxidation and the oxidation damage from the human body is one of the most important issues for human health. Creating a supply of antioxidant large enough to supply humans on a global scale has been the greatest issue as antioxidant-rich materials are difficult to source and expensive to process. Coffee is the world's second largest agricultural crop, but only a small percentage of its fruit, the bean, is used. Using the present invention, the “by-product” of coffee production, which has previously been viewed as waste, can provide a valuable source of the powerful antioxidants and other beneficial compounds contained in the fruit to make them more readily and abundantly available to the general public. In certain aspects, the present invention provides methods for preparing a liquid coffee fruit extract where de-beaned coffee cherries containing skin, pulp, and mucilage are frozen under substantially oxygen-free conditions at a temperature of less than about −30° F. and then thawed prior to and during the extraction step in a heated aqueous solvent such as hot water. Without being bound by any particular theory, the large change in temperature when the de-beaned coffee cherries are added to the heated aqueous solvent causes the cells of the coffee fruit to “burst,” releasing antioxidants, nutrients, and other compounds from inside the cells. The resulting liquid coffee fruit extract is advantageously highly concentrated with antioxidants including polyphenols as well as nutrients and other compounds (e.g., has a Brix value of about 40), and typically has a minimum of about 5% (w/w) (e.g., at least about 20% (w/w)) total phenolic acids including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid, and quinic acid. The liquid coffee fruit extract has beneficial anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. In certain other aspects, the present invention provides methods for preparing a dried coffee fruit product where de-beaned coffee cherries containing skin, pulp, and mucilage are dehydrated in two steps that initially brings the moisture level of the de-beaned coffee cherries to about 10% to about 15% and then brings the moisture level down to about 2% to about 4%. In certain embodiments, the dried coffee fruit product can be sprayed with a liquid coffee fruit extract described herein to fortify the dried coffee fruit product by enriching it antioxidants including polyphenols as well as nutrients and other compounds present in the concentrated liquid extract. The unfortified or fortified dried coffee fruit product can be ground into a coffee fruit powder. The resulting coffee fruit powder is advantageously highly concentrated with antioxidants including polyphenols as well as nutrients and other compounds, and typically has from about 7% and about 12% (w/w) total phenolic acids including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid, and quinic acid. The dried coffee fruit and powder products have beneficial anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. II.

III. Selection of Coffee Cherries and Preparation for Further Processing The coffee cherries can be at any stage of ripeness that is consistent with the presence of antioxidants, nutrients, and other beneficial compounds from the coffee cherries. The stage of ripeness is generally reflected by the amount of green coloring that remains on the surface of the coffee cherries, with more green coloring indicating increasingly less ripeness. The coffee cherries for use in the methods described herein can be green over, for example, about 50%, about 40%, about 30%, about 20%, about 10%, about 5%, or about 1% of their surface, or the coffee cherries can be ripe, that is, red in color. In exemplary embodiments, the coffee cherries are ripe or nearly ripe (e.g., less than about 10% or less than about 5% green on their surface). The coffee cherries can, for example, be de-beaned prior to further processing, or the entire (whole) coffee cherry can be employed. In exemplary embodiments, the coffee cherries are de-beaned. However, wherever “de-beaned coffee cherries” is used herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that entire coffee cherries can be substituted. Thus, the present invention is particularly applicable to the use of ripe cherries used in a coffee production process after the de-beaning. These cherries are generally viewed as waste from the production process owing to their rapid degradation. The de-beaned coffee cherries used in the methods described herein typically contain skin, pulp, and mucilage. As used herein, unless the context indicates otherwise, “skins,” when used in reference to coffee fruit, can be understood as equivalent to “de-beaned coffee cherries.” Providing De-Beaned Coffee Cherries De-beaned coffee cherries for use in the methods of the present invention can be provided using any method known in the art, such as the methods described herein. In exemplary embodiments, whole coffee cherries are received, washed, and floated in water to eliminate “floaters.” Undesirable cherries, including overripe or underdeveloped cherries float. Selected cherries are then “de-beaned” (pulped) using a coffee pulping machine which separates the coffee bean and coffee fruit. De-beaned coffee cherries, which can also be referred to herein as coffee fruit or skins containing pulp and mucilage, can optionally be sprayed with a preservative coating via an electric or hand operated sprayer attached to the pulping machine. The de-beaned coffee cherries can travel through a liquid medium (water) to the coffee fruit collection point, at which point the coffee fruit can be put into a press/extruder to remove the excess water on the skins that accumulated from transport. Alternatively, a vibrational screen or centrifuge can also be used to remove the water. Optional Preservative Coating The optional preservative coating can be applied to the de-beaned coffee cherries promptly after de-beaning. The optional preservative coating can have the effect of inhibiting the degradation of the antioxidants and other beneficial compounds in the coffee fruit, for example, by preventing oxidation or enzymatic degradation. For example, phenolic compounds in the coffee fruit can be oxidized by an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase (PPO). This process is evidenced by the browning of the coffee fruit. Also, coffee fruit enzymes can convert free phenols and amino acids to quinic acid. The coating retards these degradative processes and denatures the enzymes that promote oxidation, thus preserving higher amounts of antioxidants, amino acids, and free phenols. As used herein, “promptly” means within a period of time that is consistent with preservation of all or a substantial portion of the antioxidants and other beneficial compounds in the coffee cherry. “Promptly” can mean, for example, within about 24 hours, within about 12 hours, within about 6 hours, within about 4 hours, within about 3 hours, within about 2 hours, within about 1 hour, within about 45 minutes, within about 30 minutes, within about 15 minutes, within about 5 minutes, within about 1 minute, within about 30 seconds, within about 15 seconds, within about 10 seconds, or within about 5 seconds or less after the previous step in the process, or after the event referenced, as applicable. For example, the coating can be applied within about 5 minutes, or within about 1 minute, or within about 30 seconds after de-beaning. The optional coating can include, for example, one or more of ascorbic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, sulfur dioxide, sulfites such as potassium sulfite or combinations of two or more of these compounds. For example, the coating can include a combination of ascorbic acid and citric acid in water or another suitable solvent. The ascorbic acid can be used in an amount of up to or about 1 gram per gallon, 2 grams per gallon, 3 grams per gallon, 4 grams per gallon, 5 grams per gallon, 6 grams per gallon, 7 grams per gallon, 8 grams per gallon, 9 grams per gallon, 10 grams per gallon, 11 grams per gallon, 12 grams per gallon, 13 grams per gallon; 14 grams per gallon, 15 grams per gallon, 20 grams per gallon of water or suitable solvent or more, or about 10-30, about 10-20, or about 12-16 grams per gallon. In some embodiments, powder such as a food-grade powder of ascorbic acid can be used. For example, the ascorbic acid can be present in about 15 grams food grade powder per gallon of water or other suitable solvent. The citric acid can be used in an amount of up to or about 0.5 grams per gallon, 1 gram per gallon, 2 grams per gallon, 3 grams per gallon, 4 grams per gallon, 5 grams per gallon, 6 grams per gallon, 7 grams per gallon, 8 grams per gallon, 9 grams per gallon, 10 grams per gallon, 11 grams per gallon, 12 grams per gallon, 13 grams per gallon, 14 grams per gallon, 15 grams per gallon, 20 grams per gallon or more, or about 1-15, 2-10, or 5-10 grams per gallon. In some embodiments, powder such as a food-grade powder of citric acid can be used. The ratio of ascorbic acid to citric acid can be from about 4:1 to about 1:4. In exemplary embodiments, the ratio of ascorbic acid to citric acid can be about 4:1 to about 1:2, about 3:1 to about 1:1 or about 2:1. For example, the coating can be made up of about 15 grams of ascorbic acid and 7 grams of citric acid per gallon of water. One gallon of the coating can be used to treat about 100-200, about 125-175, or about 150 pounds of de-beaned coffee cherries. Optional Storage of Coffee Cherries Before Processing Depending on the circumstances under which the process is being performed, it may be desirable to store the de-beaned coffee cherries before they are further processed. In such circumstances, the storage can be done under substantially oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions. As used herein, “substantially oxygen-free conditions” and “oxygen-free conditions” are used interchangeably and mean conditions under which the de-beaned coffee cherries or processed components thereof are protected against exposure to oxygen in such quantities or activities as to favor the oxidative and/or enzymatic degradation of the antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds in the de-beaned coffee cherries. Any level of oxygen that fails to produce substantial oxidative and/or enzymatic degradation of antioxidants and/or beneficial compounds is encompassed within “oxygen-free conditions.” Oxygen-free conditions can be achieved, for example, by removing most or all oxygen from the environment around the coffee cherries, for example by evacuating and sealing a container holding the coffee cherries, or by replacing oxygen with a different gas, including an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, or combinations thereof. Other means of achieving oxygen-free conditions can also be utilized, for example by immersing the coffee cherries in a fluid with little or no oxygen or oxidative activity, such as a citric acid/ascorbic acid mixture disclosed herein, or lemon juice, sodium metabisulfate solution or sulfur dioxide, or by rendering ineffective or inactive the oxygen that is present in the environment. For example, oxygen-free conditions can be achieved by placing the coffee cherries in one or more containers and evacuating the containers. The containers can be any suitable airtight unit designed for storage, including food-grade poly bags, containment drums with or without liners, trash cans with or without liners, and/or trash/lawn/freezer bags, and can be of any capacity, for example, of about 50 lb. capacity. Any step in the methods described herein can be suitable for performing under oxygen-free conditions. If the de-beaned coffee cherries are to be stored under oxygen-free conditions, the coffee cherries are generally subjected to such conditions promptly after the cherries are de-beaned, for example, within about one minute after de-beaning. For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be transported for about 1 minute before being bagged, vacuumed, and sealed. In other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are stored under oxygen-free conditions after about 2, 3, 4, 5, or more minutes. Whether or not stored under oxygen-free conditions, the de-beaned coffee cherries can also be stored under refrigerated conditions. As used herein, the term “refrigerated conditions” means any conditions of temperature that are effective to inhibit oxidative and/or enzymatic degradation of the antioxidants and other beneficial compounds in coffee cherries. Thus, refrigeration represents one readily and economically achievable method of reducing or eliminating the activity and detrimental effect of any oxygen or residual oxygen in the environment. Refrigerated conditions may also serve to promote cell lysis in the coffee cherries, which promote release of beneficial compounds from the cells, facilitating further processing. Such conditions may also serve to denature enzymes that contribute to degradation of the coffee cherries. For example, the term “refrigerated conditions” encompasses temperatures lower than or at about 60° F., about 50° F., about 40° F., about 35° F., about 32° F., about 30° F., about 20° F., about 10° F., about 0° F., about −10° F., about −20° F., about −30° F., about −40° F., about −50° F., about −60° F., about −70° F., about −80° F., about −90° F., about −100° F., or lower. Temperatures below about 32° F. can also be considered freezing conditions. As such, the term “freezing conditions” is encompassed within the term “refrigerated conditions.” For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be stored under freezing conditions. If the de-beaned coffee cherries are to be stored under refrigerated conditions, they are subjected to such conditions promptly after the cherries are de-beaned, for example within about 15 minutes, about 5 minutes, or about 2 minutes after de-beaning. In exemplary embodiments, removal of oxygen and refrigeration (e.g., freezing) is performed promptly following de-beaning. De-beaned coffee cherries that are subjected to storage under oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions can be stored under such conditions for any length of time that is consistent with preservation of at least a substantial portion of the antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds in the coffee cherries. Such storage can last, for example, up to about 2 hours, about 4 hours, about 6 hours, about 12 hours, about 24 hours, about 3 days, about one week, about 2 weeks, about one month, about 2 months, about 3 months, about 4 months, about 5 months, about 6 months, about 12 months, about 18 months, about 24 months, or longer. For example, such storage can last up to about 6 months, though frozen de-beaned coffee cherries that have reached the time limit can be processed and preserved as dried skins. Should transport be desirable in order to deliver the coffee cherries to a storage facility, such transport can also take place under oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions. IV. Process for Preparing Coffee Fruit Extract In one aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing a liquid extract that is rich in antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from de-beaned coffee cherries. In this process, coffee cherries are selected, de-beaned, optionally sprayed with a preservative coating, and frozen under refrigerated conditions as described herein. In exemplary embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are frozen at a temperature of less than about −30° F. in a container such as a deoxygenated food-safe poly bag. In alternative embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are frozen at a temperature of less than about −30° F. in a container such as a food-safe poly bag without deoxygenating. In particular embodiments, de-beaned coffee cherries are frozen for a suitable period of time (e.g., about 24 hours) before they are partially or completely thawed for the extraction step. In alternative embodiments, frozen coffee cherries are promptly contacted with an aqueous solvent (e.g., at an elevated temperature) for the extraction step. Extracting Coffee Fruit Nutrients Extraction of the coffee fruit nutrients can be achieved by using any means known in the art that is suitable for extracting the antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds in coffee cherries. For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be contacted with an aqueous solvent such as water in an extraction tank. Other suitable solvents include methanol, ethanol, or a combination of either or both of methanol and ethanol with water. For example, the aqueous solvent can be about a 50/50 (measured by volume, by weight, or by w/v or v/w) mixture of water and ethanol, or water and methanol. In particular embodiments, the aqueous solvent is water. The water can be purified water, and such purification can be carried out by any known method, including for example reverse osmosis, membrane filtering, charcoal bed filtering, deionization, distillation or a combination of these methods. For example, the aqueous solvent can be lab-quality water, prepared by subjecting it to reverse osmosis and then de-ionizing it. For example, the water can be prepared by subjecting it to reverse osmosis, membrane filtering, and charcoal bed filtering to reach a high level of purity, e.g., <3 ppm, and then de-ionizing. The water or other extraction fluid can optionally contain additional preservatives such as ascorbic acid, citric acid, or others known in the art. The extraction can also be done using ultra-high pressure extraction (known as UPE), which can be useful for extracting phenols or other antioxidants or beneficial compounds in coffee cherries. In UPE, high pressure can be used to “push” the solvent through the material without excessive heat that could cause degradation. The temperature of the aqueous solvent can be an elevated temperature, for example, above room temperature. The temperature of the aqueous solvent can be, for example, at least about 70° F., 80° F., 90° F., 100° F., 110° F., 120° F., 130° F., 140° F., 145° F., 150° F., 155° F., 160° F., 170° F., 180° F., 190° F., 200° F., 210° F., or higher. The amount of the aqueous solvent used in the extraction can be expressed as a ratio versus the amount of de-beaned coffee cherries. For example, the aqueous solvent:coffee fruit ratio (in units of gallons solvent:pounds coffee fruit) can be at least about 0.01:1, 0.1:1, 0.2:1, 0.3:1, 0.4:1, 0.5:1, 0.6:1, 0.7:1, 0.8:1, 0.9:1, 1:1, 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, 1.4:1, 1.5:1, 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, 2:1, or higher. The extraction can be carried out under oxygen-free conditions. In certain embodiments, extraction is achieved by adding frozen or partially or completely thawed de-beaned coffee cherries to a heated aqueous solvent such as hot filtered water (about 180° F.). Without being bound by any particular theory, the temperature difference between the coffee cherries and the hot water causes the cells to burst or lyse, releasing the nutrients (e.g., antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds) within the cells. In particular embodiments, de-beaned coffee cherries frozen at −30° F. are first slowly warmed from −30° F. to +30° F. in a controlled temperature room in a process that takes from about 8-16 hours (approximately overnight) before adding the (partially) thawed coffee cherries to a heated aqueous solvent such as hot water (about 180° F.) to perform the extraction of antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds. The extraction steps described herein can be performed once, or they can be performed multiple times, in order to achieve desired purity and yield. In some embodiments, de-beaned coffee cherries to be extracted can optionally be subjected to a maceration step. During the maceration step, the de-beaned coffee cherries are chopped into fragments. The average size of the fragments can be, for example, less than about 5 cm, 4 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm, 1 cm, 9 mm, 8 mm, 7 mm, 6 mm, 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2, mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.1 mm or smaller, where the measurement reflects the largest dimension of length of the fragment. For example, the fragments can be about 0.5-2 mm or 1-2 mm. The maceration step can be performed using any means known in the art for such purpose, e.g., a maceration tank. In some embodiments, the maceration tank contains one or more grinder/maceration pumps at the bottom, and can be airtight and oxygen-free using nitrogen to replace the oxygen. As a non-limiting example, the tank can hold the solvent, including an aqueous solvent such as purified water, at a ratio of approximately 1 gallon to 1 pound (liquid extract to de-beaned coffee cherry). In some embodiments, “grinder pumps” can be used to pump the liquefied material to a sealed extraction vessel for extraction. For example, the maceration step can be carried out in a maceration tank under oxygen-free conditions. In other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries to be extracted can optionally be agitated (e.g., mixed). Agitation can be carried out by any method known in the art, for example by mechanical agitation (e.g., motor and blades), ultrasonic agitation (using, e.g., an ultrasonic transducer), and/or enzymatic agitation (e.g., by using introduced enzymes in accordance with methods known in the art). For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be agitated using mechanical agitation. Such mechanical agitation can be accomplished using a Lightnin agitator (Lightnin; Rochester, N.Y.). The de-beaned coffee cherries or fragments thereof if macerated can be agitated for a period of time, so as to facilitate the extraction process. For example, the mixture can be agitated for at least about 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 35 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 1 hour, 1 hour 30 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours or longer. The mixture can, for example, be agitated for about 30-40 minutes or longer. The resulting extract can be filtered to remove particulate matter, including coffee cherry pulp sediment and/or skin pieces. Filtration methods are known in the art, and a person of ordinary skill can choose the appropriate filtration method from among those known. Non-limiting examples of such filtration methods include: 1) membrane filtration, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis with either spiral-wound, stainless steel, ceramic, tubular, or plate-and-frame configurations; 2) sediment clarifying, whereby a food-grade tank can be employed to hold the extract under oxygen-free conditions to allow sediment to collect at the bottom of the tank due to gravity, e.g., for a period of about 1-24 or more hours, and removing the bottom sediment using, e.g., a separator valve; 3) press and filter methods, whereby a mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic press can be employed to squeeze the extract through a sieve or a series of sieves, or screen with less than 5 microns in size to eliminate sediment; 4) centrifugation, whereby a centrifuge can be used to separate the solids by centrifugal force; and 5) vacuum filtration, which can provide another oxygen-free filtration method. For example, the extract can be filtered using a press and filter method through a fine screen to remove any pulp or skin pieces. The filtrate can then be collected in a container such as a food-grade holding tank, in which it can be stored under oxygen-free conditions. The holding tank can also be used for clarifying/filtering by gravity separation (described below), or for overflow management, e.g., if too much liquid is being processed for the evaporators to keep up, or if the evaporators are operating at full capacity. Particulate matter can also or additionally be removed by sedimentation, i.e., by allowing the mixture to stand and the particulate matter to settle to the bottom of the storage vessel, using methods such as those described above. After sedimentation, the supernatant liquid is removed for further processing. The supernatant liquid can optionally be filtered. Sedimentation, if used, can also be conducted under oxygen-free conditions, for example under a blanket of inert gas. The fluids and filtrate at this point can be referred to as a dilute extract. The particulate matter collected during filtration can optionally be processed further in a fruit/herb press, for example, a pneumatic press of 10 tons capacity (Eden Labs; Tacoma, Wash.), a hydraulic press, or similar device to generate additional fluid. The fluid generated by pressing the particular matter can then be added to the filtrate generated during the filtration step and added to the dilute extract. Evaporating and Concentrating Coffee Fruit Extract The dilute extract can be subjected to one or more evaporation steps. The evaporation step removes aqueous liquid content, and results in a more concentrated extract. Extract concentration is monitored using Brix measurements. Brix values are generally used to measure sugar concentration in a liquid, but they can also be used as a proxy for extract concentration, i.e., the higher the Brix value, the more concentrated the extract. The dilute extract can have a low Brix value, for example, less than about 10 Brix, 8 Brix, 6 Brix, 4 Brix, or lower, or between about 0.1 and 10 Brix, about 1 and about 5 Brix, about 1 and about 3 Brix, or about 3.5 and about 5 Brix, or from about 1.5 to about 2.5 Brix. The Brix value of the concentrated extract can be up to or at least about 1.5 Brix, 2.5 Brix, 5 Brix, 10 Brix, 15 Brix, 20 Brix X, 25 Brix, 30 Brix, 35 Brix, 40 Brix, 45 Brix, 50 Brix, 55 Brix, 60 Brix, 65 Brix, 70 Brix, 75 Brix, 80 Brix, 85 Brix, 90 Brix, 95 Brix, 100 Brix, or higher, or between about 30 and about 70 Brix, about 30 and about 60 Brix, about 30 and about 50 Brix, about 40 and about 60 Brix, or about 40 Brix or 50 Brix. The extract can be reduced by a ratio of up to about 5:1, about 10:1, about 15:1, about 20:1, about 25:1, about 35:1, about 40:1, about 45:1, about 50:1, about 60:1, or higher (where the ratio indicates initial versus final volume). Brix measurements can be conducted using a “Brix Meter” or “Refractometer.” The liquid extract can be concentrated to any desired level, from a relatively dilute extract to a very concentrated and viscous extract and even subjected to complete evaporation (e.g., less than about 10% moisture content, or about 4-6% moisture content or below) to provide a dry extract concentrate. The evaporation step can be conducted using any means and methods known in the art, for example, using a tube falling film evaporator, plate evaporator, a spinning band column evaporator, or a spinning cone evaporator. In a tube falling film evaporator, the liquid to be evaporated is distributed onto an upper tube sheet and onto heating tubes by an especially developed distribution system. From this system, the product flows downwards in the heating tubes to a lower tube sheet as a thin film. The evaporated vapor (steam) flows downwards in the same direction and consequently accelerates the flowing of the film. This limits the period of residence, during which the liquid to be evaporated is retained in the heating tube, to a few seconds. In a plate evaporator, the main feature is the compact design. The constructional height ranges from 3 to 5 meters depending on the design. Plate evaporators normally are designed for rising flow in single-pass operation. This keeps the thermal strain on the product as low as possible. Concentration of clear juice, or juice containing little pulp, are examples of application in the fruit juice industry. The spinning cone evaporator is a compact unit well-suited for the concentration of heat-sensitive, valuable and viscous products. It offers a short residence time, less thermal impact and greater processing flexibility than traditional rising or falling film evaporators. For example, the evaporation can be done using a spinning cone evaporator, such as Centritherm® evaporator (FT Technologies; Griffith, Australia). In exemplary embodiments, the evaporation step is conducted under low temperature conditions and/or at reduced pressure. As used herein, low temperature means a temperature less than or about 100° F., 90° F., 80° F., 70° F., 60° F., 50° F., or lower, or from about 50-100° F., 70-100° F., 50-80° F., 50-60° F., 60-70° F., 70-80° F., 80-90° F., or 90-100° F. For example, the evaporation can be done at a temperature of less than about 100° F. In some embodiments, the evaporation is performed under low temperature and oxygen-free conditions. In particular embodiments, evaporation can be carried out using vacuum-based techniques, e.g., using a vacuum concentrator to concentrate the liquid extract under low temperature conditions. The resulting concentrated extract can be stored under oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions, and can also be pasteurized if desired. Evaporation can be performed in multiple steps, where after a certain amount of time has passed or a particular Brix concentration measurement has been reached, additional filtration steps described herein can be performed. For example, evaporation can be halted when the liquid extract reaches a Brix concentration of about 20 and filtered using a gravity sediment removal step, whereby a food-grade tank can be employed to hold the extract under oxygen-free conditions to allow sediment to collect at the bottom of the tank due to gravity, e.g., for a period of at least about 12 or more hours, and removing the bottom sediment. Evaporation can then be continued to further concentrate the liquid extract until a Brix concentration of about 40 is reached and filtered again using another gravity sediment removal step. Additional filtration steps ensure minimal particulate matter and high quality of concentrated fruit extract. Once concentrated to the desired Brix level, the resulting extract is stored in a cool and dry place with no refrigeration required. The shelf-life of the liquid extract is about 18 months when stored at ambient room temperature conditions. The liquid extract concentrate has a high amount of antioxidants such as polyphenols and other beneficial compounds and typically contains at least about 5% (w/w) total phenolic acids. For example, the liquid extract can comprise a total phenolic acid concentration of from about 5% to about 50% (w/w), about 10% to about 50% (w/w), about 15% to about 50% (w/w), about 20% to about 50% (w/w), about 5% to about 40% (w/w), about 10% to about 40% (w/w), about 15% to about 40% (w/w), about 20% to about 40% (w/w), about 5% to about 30% (w/w), about 10% to about 30% (w/w), about 15% to about 30% (w/w), about 20% to about 30% (w/w), about 5% to about 25% (w/w), about 10% to about 25% (w/w), about 15% to about 25% (w/w), about 20% to about 25% (w/w), about 5% to about 20% (w/w), about 10% to about 20% (w/w), about 15% to about 20% (w/w), about 5% to about 15% (w/w), about 10% to about 15% (w/w), about 5% to about 10% (w/w), or about or at least about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% (w/w). Non-limiting examples of antioxidants include phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferluic acid, quinic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids of various types, and combinations thereof. The term “chlorogenic acid” includes a family of esters of hydroxycinnamic acids (e.g., caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid) with quinic acid and isomers thereof such as caffeoylquinic acids (CQA), with 3 isomers (3-, 4-, and 5-CQA), dicaffeoylquinic acids (diCQA), with 3 isomers (3,4-diCQA; 3,5-diCQA; 4,5-diCQA), feruloylquinic acids (FQA), with 3 isomers (3-, 4- and 5-FQA); p-coumaroylquinic acids (pCoQA), with 3 isomers (3-, 4-, and 5-pCoQA), six mixed diesters of caffeoyl-feruloyl-quinic acids (CFAQ), diferuloylquinic acids, dimethoxycinamoylquinic acids, caffeoyl-dimethoxycinamoylquinic acids, feruloyl-dimethoxycinamoylquinic acids, and combinations thereof. Other beneficial compounds include, but are not limited to, phytochemicals (e.g., flavonoids), vitamins, and/or other nutrients such as prodelphinidins, procyanidins, trigonelline, lignins, tannins such as condensed tannins, coffee saccharides, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and combinations thereof. V. Process for Preparing Dried Coffee Fruit In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing dried coffee fruit that is rich in antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from de-beaned coffee cherries. In this process, coffee cherries are selected, de-beaned, optionally sprayed with a preservative coating, and dried with a dehydrator as described herein. The de-beaned coffee cherries can immediately begin the dehydration process or can be stored for later processing by refrigeration (e.g., freezing at a temperature of less than about −30° F. in a container such as a deoxygenated food-safe poly bag). In some embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are sprayed with a preservative coating, but are not refrigerated (e.g., frozen at about −30° F.) before dehydrating. In other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are sprayed with a preservative coating and refrigerated (e.g., frozen at about −30° F.) before dehydrating. In yet other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are not sprayed with a preservative coating, but are refrigerated (e.g., frozen at about −30° F.). In still other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries proceed to dehydration without a preservative coating spray or refrigeration (e.g., freezing at about −30° F.). Drying Coffee Fruit Drying of the coffee fruits, with or without protective spray/refrigeration steps, is achieved using one or more dehydration machines in a single step or multiple steps. In certain embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are dehydrated to a lower water content, for example, to less than about 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or lower, by weight, in water content. For example, the coffee cherries can have a water content of about 4% (w/w) or less after dehydration (e.g., about 2% by weight for tea products). Any method known in the art for dehydrating food samples, including any suitable conditions of time and temperature, can be used with the processes disclosed herein. For example, the dehydration can be done under low heat, for example, up to or about 100° F., 105° F., 110° F., 115° F., 120° F., 125° F., 130° F., 135° F., 140° F., 145° F., 150° F., 160° F., 180° F., or 200° F., or higher, or between about 100-200° F., about 100-150° F., about 120-170° F., about 130-160° F., or about 130-150° F. In particular embodiments, the dehydration is performed under low heat at a temperature of less than about 125° F. The dehydration can be done for a period of time, for example, at least about 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, or longer. For example, dehydration can be done at a temperature of less than about 125° F. for about 10-12 hours, or until the desired water content is achieved. In some embodiments, the dehydration step can be carried out under oxygen-free conditions, for example, by exposing the de-beaned coffee cherries to an inert gas such as nitrogen during dehydration. In exemplary embodiments, the dehydration is carried out in two dehydration steps. For example, the first dehydration step (e.g., using a refrigerated air/condenser/dryer system under low heat or a stainless steel mesh belt dryer) reduces the water content of the de-beaned coffee cherries from about 85%-90% to about 10%, and the second dehydration step (e.g., using a finish dryer) further reduces the water content from about 10% to about 4% or less. The second dehydrator can optionally pasteurize the dehydrated coffee cherries using microwaves (approximately 1-2 or more hours using the methods disclosed herein). Alternatively, a centrifuge can be used to reduce the water content of the de-beaned coffee cherries. The de-beaned coffee cherries can be conveyed to the (first) dehydrator using a shaker/vibrator conveyor, or loaded directly into the dehydrator. Once dehydrated, the dried coffee fruit product is stored in a cool and dry place with no refrigeration required. The shelf-life of the dried coffee fruit is about 18 months when stored at ambient room temperature conditions. In certain embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries, with or without protective spray/refrigeration steps, are shredded to a size of from about 3 mm to about 10 mm using a shredding machine such as a “Toro Brand” leaf shredder or a mechanically similar machine such as a stainless steel “WATERFALL” shredder (COMMERCIAL brand model NS-26). The shredded coffee fruit can travel by air, gravity, and/or conveyors into a heated air cyclone to quickly pre-dry the coffee fruit to a moisture level of about 10% to about 15% from an initial moisture level of about 85% to about 90%. The coffee fruit can then travel to a second dehydrator (e.g., a finish dryer) that uses gas, solar, electricity, and/or microwaves for finish drying and pasteurizing. In some embodiments, the optional shredding step can be enhanced by reducing the surrounding oxygen by tenting the air intakes to the shredder and cyclone and replacing oxygen with nitrogen via a nitrogen generator. After dehydration of the de-beaned coffee cherries (e.g., after either the first or second dehydration step if two dehydration steps are used), the dried coffee fruit can be subjected to an optional enrichment step to fortify the dried fruit product with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds. This enrichment step can involve contacting the dehydrated coffee cherries with an enriching substance, such as a liquid coffee fruit extract prepared using the process disclosed herein. Such contacting can be carried out by, for example, spraying the dehydrated cherries with an aqueous or other extract. For example, when the de-beaned coffee cherries that are dehydrating have reached a moisture content of about 4%, the dehydrated coffee cherries can be sprayed with a liquid coffee fruit extract prepared as described herein or using methods known in the art, to enrich the dehydrated de-beaned coffee cherry product. In certain instances, the spray amount can be about 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more ounces of extract per kilogram of dehydrated coffee fruit. For example, the spray amount can be about 1 ounce of 40 Brix liquid coffee fruit extract for every kilogram of dried coffee fruit (based on about 4% moisture level). In certain embodiments, the dried coffee fruit is further processed to a powdered form after dehydration using any grinding or powder-creating machine known in the art such as a Fitzmill (e.g., Fitzmill DAS-06 available from IDEX MPT Inc.). In some instances, mesh screens of varying sizes (e.g., screen sizes #20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, etc.) are used to grind the dried coffee fruit into a powder and obtain particles of the desired size and uniformity. For example, the #40 screen size creates a powder with a medium particle size. In other instances, micro-grinding machines are used to finely grind the dried coffee fruit to the size of flour particles. The particles present in the coffee fruit powder typically have a median or mean particle size ranging from about 100 μm to about 500 μm, e.g., about 250 μm to about 500 μm, about 200 μm to about 425 μm, about 300 μm to about 500 μm, about 100 μm to about 300 μm, or about 100 μm, 150 μm, 200 μm, 250 μm, 300 μm, 350 μm, 400 μm, 450 μm, or 500 μm. In particular embodiments, the coffee fruit powder prepared from dried coffee fruit as described herein comprises a total phenolic acid concentration of from about 5% to about 25% (w/w), e.g., about 5% to about 20% (w/w), about 5% to about 15% (w/w), about 7% to about 15% (w/w), about 7% to about 12% (w/w), about 10% to about 25% (w/w), about 10% to about 20% (w/w), about 10% to about 15% (w/w), about 15% to about 25% (w/w), about 20% to about 25% (w/w), or about or at least about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, or 25% (w/w). In certain instances, the phenolic acids present in the coffee fruit powder include, but are not limited to, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid, quinic acid, and combinations thereof.

Process for Preparing Powder from Coffee Fruit Extract In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a process for drying a liquid coffee fruit extract to produce a concentrated powder suitable for human consumption and other uses. In this process, coffee cherries are selected, de-beaned, and the antioxidants and other nutrients of the fruit are extracted according to the method described herein to product a liquid extract. The liquid extract can be concentrated to a Brix value of about 40, and then subjected to a drying process to prepare a concentrated powder. In some embodiments, the drying process is a spray dry process. In particular embodiments, the drying process is a pulse dry process. Other drying processes include, but are not limited to, vacuum microwave, freeze-drying, and air-drying methods. Pulse drying is a process that uses flash atomization to prepare dried powders with a speeding jet of hot gas. For example, the pulse drying process can comprise a rhythmic, pulsing action by a super-heated gas to produce particles with desired properties such as particle size, particle size distribution, and particle shape. When compared to spray dryers, pulse dryers dry the liquid of interest in a fraction of the time with significantly improved thermal efficiencies and with particle characteristics that cannot be achieved with spray dryers. Pulse drying systems generally include a drying chamber, cyclone, and bag housing, and are available from, e.g., Wave Dry (Corte Madera, Calif.). The process of drying the liquid extract described herein into a powder protects heat-sensitive nutrients present in the extract. The resulting powder is particularly advantageous over powders prepared from conventionally dried fruit because it is prepared using a concentrated liquid extract (e.g., about 40 Brix value) containing a higher level of beneficial compounds including antioxidants and polyphenols that are of interest in nutrition and human health. The finished product is stored in a cool and dry place, and requires no refrigeration. The powder form of the liquid extract typically contains at least about 5% (w/w) total phenolic acids. For example, the powder prepared by the process described herein can comprise a total phenolic acid concentration of from about 5% to about 50% (w/w), about 10% to about 50% (w/w), about 15% to about 50% (w/w), about 20% to about 50% (w/w), about 5% to about 40% (w/w), about 10% to about 40% (w/w), about 15% to about 40% (w/w), about 20% to about 40% (w/w), about 5% to about 30% (w/w), about 10% to about 30% (w/w), about 15% to about 30% (w/w), about 20% to about 30% (w/w), about 5% to about 25% (w/w), about 10% to about 25% (w/w), about 15% to about 25% (w/w), about 20% to about 25% (w/w), about 5% to about 20% (w/w), about 10% to about 20% (w/w), about 15% to about 20% (w/w), about 5% to about 15% (w/w), about 10% to about 15% (w/w), about 5% to about 10% (w/w), or about or at least about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% (w/w). VII. Coffee Fruit Products and Compositions In certain aspects, the present invention provides coffee fruit products including liquid extracts, dried fruit, and powders prepared by the methods described herein. In certain other aspects, the present invention provides compositions including beverages, foods, neutraceuticals, and cosmetics comprising one or more of the coffee fruit products prepared by the methods described herein.

In certain instances, the phenolic acids present in the coffee fruit powder include, but are not limited to, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid, quinic acid, and combinations thereof. In certain instances, the coffee fruit powder is a super-concentrated dry product containing high levels of antioxidants prepared from the liquid coffee fruit extract described herein. In other instances, the coffee fruit powder is a fortified or enriched coffee fruit powder prepared by contacting (e.g., spraying) dried coffee fruit with the liquid coffee fruit extract prior to grinding dried coffee fruit into a powder. The compositions comprising one or more of the coffee fruit products described herein can be ingested or topically applied by a human and/or animal for nutritional, feed supplement, health-maintenance, health-improvement, and/or recreational purpose. Non-limiting examples of compositions for consumption include solid products (e.g., dietary supplements, snack bars, neutraceuticals, etc.) and liquid products (e.g., juices, sports drinks, carbonated beverages, teas, and other beverages, syrups, elixirs, etc.). Non-limiting examples of compositions for topical use include skin care products, anti-aging products, and other cosmetics. VIII. EXAMPLES The following examples are provided in order to better enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the disclosed compositions and methods, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Example 1 Preparation of Coffee Fruit Extract After removal of the coffee bean, the remaining coffee fruit (skin, pulp, and mucilage) retains many nourishing compounds including antioxidants, polyphenols, phytochemicals, vitamins, etc. that are of interest in nutrition and human health. The following example provides a process for extracting and concentrating the nutrients of the coffee fruit to produce a liquid extract suitable for human consumption and other uses. Selection of Desirable Coffee Cherries The process begins with whole coffee cherries that are washed and “floated.” Undesirable cherries, such as overripe and underdeveloped coffee cherries float, whereas ripe and desirable coffee cherries do not. Thus, “floating” plus visual inspection allow for the easy removal of undesirable cherries. Pulping Coffee Cherry and Preparing Fruit for Extraction After selection of ripe coffee cherries, the cherries are then de-seeded (pulped). The remaining coffee fruits (skin, pulp, and mucilage) are transported a short distance (within 100 yards of the pulping area) via a PVC pipe (or similar rapid food-safe transport) using clean filtered water as a transport medium. Optionally, after de-seeding the pulped cherries (coffee fruits) can be sprayed with a mist comprising or consisting of a mixture of ascorbic acid and citric acid in water. For example, the aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and citric acid can be prepared by mixing ½ cup ascorbic acid and ¼ cup citric acid per gallon of water. Generally, the mist is applied to the coffee fruits as they leave the pulping machine. Without being bound by any particular theory, the inclusion of this step slows the oxidation (browning) of the coffee fruits, thereby extending the working time of the coffee fruits before the fruits degrade. Once the cherries are pulped and transferred, a press/extruder is used to remove the excess water on the coffee fruits that was introduced during the transport from the pulper area to the press/extruder area. Optionally, excess water is removed by using a vibration screen or centrifuge. All excess water can be collected and pumped back to the pulping area for reuse. Next, the coffee fruits are immediately bagged into food-safe poly bags and sealed. Oxygen is removed from the bags using a vacuum pump since any remaining oxygen in the bags can react with the coffee fruits to degrade the desirable antioxidants. The sealed vacuumed bags are immediately placed at −30° Fahrenheit (F) for about 24 hours to irreversibly denature enzymes that degrade the coffee fruits. Extracting Coffee Fruit Nutrients Frozen coffee fruits are slowly brought from −30° F. to +30° F. in a controlled temperature room overnight. Coffee fruits at +30° F. are further thawed by adding them to 180° F. filtered hot water. Once added to the hot water, the coffee fruits are mixed, agitated, or macerated (chopped or ground into small pieces) in the hot water. Optionally, the hot water is de-ionized. Without being bound by any particular theory, the large change in temperature when the coffee fruits are added to the hot water causes the cells of the coffee fruit to “burst,” releasing the nutrients from inside the cells. The step of mixing, agitating, or macerating the coffee fruits in the hot water aids in the extraction process, particularly the macerating step, which allows more contact of the coffee fruit surface with the water. Macerating can be achieved by a number of machines including a grinder-pump or a sheer-pump. The coffee fruits are incubated and the nutrients are extracted in the hot water with mixing, agitation, or maceration for about 20-40 minutes. After extraction of the nutrients, the resulting “Tea” and saturated fruit (skins and pulp) are transferred from the extraction tanks to a press/extruder to remove all remaining “Tea” from the saturated skins and pulp. The resulting “Tea” is next filtered through a fine screen to remove the pulp and skin pieces. Evaporating and Concentrating Coffee Fruit Nutrients The isolated “Tea” is collected in a food-safe liquid tote (IBC) and is held for a minimum of 1 hour. The 1 hour incubation allows any sediment/pulp to separate by gravity. Any sediment that collects is removed. At this point the “Tea” contains a measurable refractive index between 3.5 and 5 Brix. Concentration of the “Tea” is achieved at low temperatures (e.g., under 100° F.) using a vacuum concentrator which allows the “Tea” to boil at close to room temperature. The vacuum concentrator evaporates the “Tea” until the Brix Measurement reaches 20. After reaching a higher concentration, a second gravity sedimentation step is included to remove any additional pulp or skin. After about 12 hours any sediment that collects is removed and the vacuum concentration process continues until the measured concentration reaches 40 Brix, the desired finished value. Finally, a third gravity sedimentation step is performed, and sediment is removed. Optionally, the 40 Brix concentrated “Tea” can be pasteurized by transferring the “Tea” to a pasteurizing machine where the “Tea” is very quickly heated and cooled. Once concentration, final gravity sedimentation, and optional pasteurization is complete, the “Tea” is placed into new sterile food-safe IBC totes and stored in cool and dry conditions. The finished product needs no refrigeration.

The following example provides a process for drying the coffee fruit to produce dried skins and powders suitable for human consumption and other uses. Selection of Desirable Coffee Cherries The process begins with whole coffee cherries that are washed and “floated.” Undesirable cherries, such as overripe and underdeveloped coffee cherries float, whereas ripe and desirable coffee cherries do not. Thus, “floating” plus visual inspection allow for the easy removal of undesirable cherries. Pulping Coffee Cherry and Preparing Fruit for Drying After selection of ripe coffee cherries, the cherries are then de-seeded (pulped). The remaining coffee fruits (skin, pulp, and mucilage) are transported a short distance (within 100 yards of the pulping area) via a PVC pipe (or similar rapid food-safe transport) using clean filtered water as a transport medium.

Once the cherries are pulped and transferred, a press/extruder is used to remove the excess water on the coffee fruits that was introduced during the transport from the pulper area to the press/extruder area. Optionally, excess water is removed by using a vibration screen or centrifuge. All excess water can be collected and pumped back to the pulping area for reuse. After removing excess water, the coffee fruits are immediately sent (e.g., via a stainless steel auger or a food safe conveyor) to a dehydration machine. Optionally, before further processing, the coffee fruits can be preserved for later processing by immediately bagging into food-safe poly bags, sealing, vacuuming, and freezing at −30° F. Vacuuming removes the remaining oxygen in the sealed bags, which can react with the fruits to degrade the desirable antioxidants. Freezing the bags at −30° F. for about 24 hours may irreversibly denature enzymes that degrade the coffee fruit. Frozen coffee fruits can be slowly brought from −30° F. to +30° F. in a controlled temperature room overnight. Drying Coffee Cherries The coffee fruits can be dried in a dehydration machine that uses a refrigerated air/condenser/dryer system which allows for drying of the fruit using low heat (under 125° F.), retaining the nutrients of the coffee fruits. The dehydration machine is used to dry the coffee fruit from about 85% moisture level to about 10% moisture level. Once at about 10% moisture level, the coffee fruits are transferred to a finish dryer which pasteurizes the fruits using microwaves and dries them from about 10% moisture level to the desired moisture level, usually from about 2% to about 4%. Typically, this drying process can produce about 250 kg of finished product per day. Alternatively, a stainless steel mesh belt dryer is used in place of a dehydration machine to dry the coffee fruit from about 85% moisture level to about 10% moisture level. Once at about 10% moisture level, the coffee fruits are transferred to a finish dryer which pasteurizes the fruits using microwaves and dries them from about 10% moisture level to the desired moisture level, usually from about 2% to about 4%. Typically, this drying process can produce over 1 ton of finished product per day. After completing the drying process, the dried fruits are now transferred to a batch tank where they rest until they are used as dried skins or ground into a powder, depending on the preference of the consumer. The finished product is stored in a cool and dry place, and requires no refrigeration.

A liquid coffee fruit extract prepared according to Example 1 can be dried to a powder by a pulse dry process. This process spray dries the extract and protects heat-sensitive nutrients present in the extract. The resulting product is particularly advantageous over powders prepared from conventionally dried skins because it is prepared using a concentrated liquid extract (e.g., 40 Brix value) containing a higher concentration of compounds including antioxidants and polyphenols that are of interest in nutrition and human health. The finished product is stored in a cool and dry place, and requires no refrigeration. Example 4 Properties of Coffee Fruit Powder The following example illustrates some of the numerous advantageous properties exhibited by the dried coffee fruit powder prepared according to the method described herein. Cell Viability Assay The cell viability assay (CVA) is based on a proliferation assay that determines the effect of the powder of the present invention on cell growth and cell viability. The assay result is expressed as the maximum concentration of powder present in cell culture that promotes cell viability using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a marker for metabolically active cells. Effective Concentration CVA Result 1321.25 μg/ml Cellular Anti-Inflammatory Assay The cellular anti-inflammatory assay (NFκB) determines the inhibition potential of the powder of the present invention on expression/production level of NFκB in human cells. NFκB serves as a biomarker for inflammation. In particular, this assay determines the anti-inflammatory potential of the powder in human cells. NFκB (Nuclear Factor kappa B), a protein complex that is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress and free radicals, is used as inflammation biomarker. In this assay, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine, is introduced to the human cells to trigger cellular inflammation. If an anti-inflammatory material is presented in the cellular environment, the material inhibits NFκB activation and the degree of inhibition can be monitored via NFκB expression. The NFκB expression level of the human cells, treated with and without the powder of the present invention, under the stressed condition are therefore monitored and compared. Maximum percentage of NFκB expression inhibition induced by the powder is shown in the table below. The concentration used that induced the maximum inhibition of NFκB expression is also shown. Maximum Effective Inducer/Stressor inhibition Concentration NFκB Assay TNF-α 67.01% 1321.25 μg/ml Result Cellular Antioxidant Assay The cellular antioxidant assay (CAA) analyzes the capacity of the powder of the present invention to protect a fluorescent probe (as a marker) from damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an intracellular environment. In this assay, a peroxyl radical is used as the ROS, and human liver cells are used as the cellular model. Quercetin is used as the standard, and the results are expressed as μmole quercetin equivalency (μmole QE) per gram (or milliliter) of the powder. Effective Concentration CAA Result 431.82 μmole QE/gram IX.

The present invention also relates to a method of storing roasted coffee beans that is so adapted to be capable of prolonged storage of roasted coffee beans in the air. BACKGROUND ART Coffee cherries harvested from the coffee plant consist of the outer skin (outermost part), pulp, mucilage (pectin layer), endocarp (hull or parchment), silver skin, endosperm, and embryo. Such coffee cherries are stripped of the outer skin, pulp, endocarp, etc. by either dry polishing (also called non-wash polishing) or wet polishing (also called wash polishing) to obtain green coffee beans (the combination of endosperm and embryo). To make regular coffee, green coffee beans are roasted with a roaster and the resulting roasted coffee beans are ground to prepare powdered coffee, over which boiling water is poured to brew a coffee extract which is ready to be drunk. Two important characteristics in the quality of coffee are taste and aroma and since roasting greatly affects these characteristics, various ideas have heretofore been put forward to improve the way in which roasting is performed and controlled. The trouble with roasted coffee beans is that the scattering of aroma and oxidation are considerable or and if roasted coffee beans of desired quality are not consumed immediately but stored for a while, their aroma becomes weak and an off-odor called “oxidation smell” (the smell of stale beans) will develop to degrade the quality of coffee. In particular, the powdered coffee prepared by grinding roasted coffee beans with a coffee mill or the like has an increased surface area to be exposed, so that aerial oxidation will cause more marked deterioration in flavor. Under these circumstances, distributors of roasted coffee beans or their grinds generally take various measures to minimize the deterioration in the quality of roasted coffee beans and they include wrapping them with a highly hermetic packaging material so that they are sealed (evacuated) to be prevented from contact with the air (or oxygen), or replacing the surrounding atmosphere with nitrogen or other gases. However, in spite of these measures, it is difficult for consumers who have purchased roasted coffee beans or their grinds to use them up as soon as they have opened the packages, and particularly at home, it is commonplace to consume roasted coffee beans or their grinds in several divided portions, with the inevitable deterioration of their flavor in the process. Under the circumstances, methods have been developed to maintain the quality of roasted coffee beans over a prolonged period. They include a method in which coffee beans are coated with saccharides to ensure that they can be stored for a prolonged period with a smaller change in flavor over time and with suppressed oxidative deterioration (Patent Document 1); and a method in which a tocopherol compound and/or a derivative thereof is added to roasted coffee beans so that their flavor is stabilized (Patent Document 2). CITATION LIST Patent Document Patent Document 1: JP 2001-112415 A Patent Document 2: JP 1994-2027 B SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problems As described above, roasted coffee beans will undergo deterioration in their quality during prolonged exposure to the air, and the various conventional measures taken during storage of coffee beans have not proved completely satisfactory. The methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2 involve a complicated process since the step of spraying roasted coffee beans with a solution of an additive (e.g., saccharides or tocopherol) is required, and during this step, the scattering of the aroma of the roasted coffee beans and oxidation are unavoidable and, what is more, the taste of the additive will affect the taste of the final coffee product; thus, those methods are not always practically feasible. An object, therefore, of the present invention is to provide roasted coffee beans that can be stored in the air (a natural environment hostile to coffee beans) without experiencing damage to the inherent taste and aroma of coffee and with the change in flavor over time and the oxidative deterioration being suppressed to ensure that they retain a satisfactory flavor. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of storing roasted coffee beans in the air, by which the change in flavor that occurs over time, particularly in the air, and the oxidative deterioration can both be suppressed. Solution to Problems To solve the aforementioned problems, the present inventors made intensive studies and found that a very small amount of ethyl isovalerate had an action for preventing a decrease in the aroma of roasted coffee beans which are liable to change over time, and for masking the oxidation smell. As the result of a further study, they found the following: ethyl isovalerate is a component that is produced during the fermentation of coffee beans and which is sufficiently heat-resistant to be maintained in the coffee beans even after they are roasted; the aroma of roasted coffee beans containing the ethyl isovalerate is capable of maintaining the characteristic aroma of coffee that develops upon roasting; to be more specific, it was found that the aroma component of fermented coffee beans had an action for preventing a decrease in the aroma of roasted coffee beans that are liable to change over time and for masking the oxidation smell. The present inventors then confirmed that roasted coffee beans which are at least partly blended with roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate or roasted coffee beans subjected to fermentation are suppressed in terms of the change in flavor with time and the deterioration due to oxidation, even if they are accommodated in a container in such a manner that they are in contact with the air; the present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. To be more specific, the present invention relates to the following. 1. Roasted coffee beans in a container that contain ethyl isovalerate. 2. Roasted coffee beans in a container that comprise roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate. 3. The roasted coffee beans in a container as recited in 1 or 2, wherein the container accommodates the roasted coffee beans as they are in contact with the air. 4. The roasted coffee beans in a container as recited in any one of 1 to 3, wherein the proportion of ethyl isovalerate is 10 ppb or more relative to the total quantity of the coffee beans. 5. The roasted coffee beans in a container as recited in any one of 1 to 4, wherein the roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate are fermented, roasted coffee beans that have been subjected to fermentation and roasting. 6. The roasted coffee beans in a container as recited in 5, wherein the proportion of the fermented, roasted coffee beans is 1 wt % or more of the total quantity of the coffee beans. 7. The roasted coffee beans in a container as recited in 5 or 6, wherein the proportion of the fermented, roasted coffee beans is 50 wt % or less of the total quantity of the coffee beans. 8. The roasted coffee beans in a container as recited in any one of 5 to 7, wherein the fermented, roasted coffee beans contain 5 ppm or more of ethyl acetate and/or 500 ppm or more of ethanol. 9. A process for producing roasted coffee beans including the step of treating roasted coffee beans such that they comprise roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate. 10. A method of storing roasted coffee beans in the air, including the step of treating roasted coffee beans such that they comprise roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate. Advantageous Effects of Invention According to the present invention, roasted coffee beans that need be stored for a prolonged period may be treated in such a way that they incorporate ethyl isovalerate; for example, this can be done by blending them with coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate (for example, fermented coffee beans) to be at least a part of the beans; the thus treated roasted coffee beans can be stored in the air without suffering degradation of their quality. Hence, there is no need to take special measures such as storing ground coffee beans in a sealed or vacuum state to prevent contact with the air (or oxygen), or purging with nitrogen or other gases. Even if pouched coffee beans (or their grinds) as distributed in a vacuum or another state are opened at home and consumed in several divided portions, their aroma and flavor will not be impaired by the air, but the preferred quality of the roasted coffee beans will be maintained to ensure that coffee having the desirable aroma can be drunk at any time over a prolonged period. The roasted coffee beans containing fermented, roasted coffee beans that are obtained by the present invention are not only capable of storage over a prolonged period but they also present an advantageous effect in terms of the quality of a coffee extract brewed from the roasted coffee beans—the extract, due to the addition of the fermented, roasted coffee beans, has a blooming top note and body (richness) while being immune to changes with time (e.g., scattering of aroma and oxidation). Ground coffee beans obtained by grinding roasted coffee beans in the air undergo scattering of aroma during grinding to a considerable extent which is typically reported to range from 40 to 50%; however, the roasted coffee beans of the present invention have the advantage that even if they are ground in the air, their aroma will not be readily scattered, making it possible to obtain a powdered coffee having rich aroma. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Roasted Coffee Beans “Roasted coffee beans” as referred to in the present invention are those obtained by subjecting green coffee beans to a heat treatment called “roasting.” Upon roasting, the components in the green coffee beans undergo chemical changes, causing the inherent characteristics such as aroma, taste and color of coffee to develop. Unless otherwise noted, the “roasted coffee beans” as used in the present invention shall cover, for the sake of convenience, grinds of roasted coffee beans (which may sometimes be designated “powdered coffee”). In the present invention, the varieties of coffee beans are not particularly limited. Examples include Brazilian, Columbian, Tanzanian, Mocha, Kilimanjaro, Mandheling, Blue Mountain, etc. Coffee species include Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, etc. Coffee beans may be of a single species or variety; alternatively, two or more species or varieties may be blended. The roasting method and conditions are not particularly limited and a suitable heat source such as direct fire, hot air, semi-hot air, charcoal fire, far-infrared radiation, microwaves, or superheated steam may be applied to suitable equipment such as a horizontal drum, vertical drum, vertical rotating bowl, fluidized bed or a pressurized vessel so that coffee beans are roasted to a suitable level (i.e., light, cinnamon, medium, high, city, full city, French or Italian) that meets the desired object depending on the species or variety of the coffee beans. From the viewpoint of recovering the soluble solids in high yield during extracting, the open horizontal drum, the sealed horizontal drum or the vertical rotating bowl is preferred, with the vertical rotating bowl being more preferred. From the viewpoint of suppressing the oxidation smell, it is preferred to roast the coffee beans in such a manner that an L value, as measured with a color-difference meter and used as an index for the roast level, reads about 10-30, preferably about 10-25, more preferably about 15-25. In coffee beans roasted to this roast level, the effect of ethyl isovalerate for suppressing (masking) the oxidation smell is markedly exhibited. The roast level may be measured by the following procedure: 50% of the roasted coffee beans under test are ground to particles sized 0.8-1.2 mm; the amounts of particles sized 0.5 mm and less and particles sized 2 mm and more are each adjusted to 5% and less; chafe is removed as necessary; the ground beans are charged into a cell, tapped sufficiently, and then subjected to measurement with a spectroscopic colorimeter. A spectroscopic colorimeter that may be used is SE-2000 produced by NIPPON DENSHOKU INDUSTRIES CO., LTD. From the viewpoint of ensuring a good flavor, the roasted coffee beans are desirably cooled to a temperature between 0 and 100° C., preferably between 10 and 60° C. within 30 minutes after the roasting. Ethyl Isovalerate The present invention is characterized by incorporating ethyl isovalerate in the roasted coffee beans described above. Ethyl isovalerate (also designated as butanoic acid 3-methyl-ethyl ester, butyric acid 3-methyl-ethyl ester, or isovaleric acid ethyl ester) is a compound represented by the following formula (I): and it is found in fruits such as pineapple, strawberry, and citrus. For the roasted coffee beans of the present invention, it is possible to use an ethyl isovalerate containing plant extract obtained from plants containing the substance by any known extraction method; the plant extract may be added as such or, alternatively, the ethyl isovalerate in the extract may be concentrated or purified and the resulting concentrate or pure product may then be added to the roasted coffee beans. If the fruit extract is directly added to the roasted coffee beans, the flavor of the fruit may potentially affect a coffee beverage that is prepared by brewing the roasted coffee beans with boiling water or the like; hence, rather than being used as a fruit extract, ethyl isovalerate is preferably used in the form of a concentrate or purified product or as a synthetic product. The present inventors also confirmed by investigation that the coffee beans subjected to fermentation contained ethyl isovalerate. Since none of the unfermented, green coffee beans, the coffee beans obtained by roasting them, and the commercial coffee beverages were found to contain ethyl isovalerate, it may be concluded that ethyl isovalerate is a compound that was specifically produced in coffee beans by subjecting them to fermentation. The coffee beans subjected to fermentation (hereinafter referred to as “fermented coffee beans”) are obtained by treating harvested coffee cherries with a certain fermentation-based process that utilizes the function of a microorganism, and they are coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate at a concentration that can be detected by the following method. (Method of Detecting Ethyl Isovalerate in Coffee Beans) Green coffee beans (5 g) were first ground to a medium grind, to which distilled water (50 mL) was added for steam distillation; the resulting distillate (100 mL) was put into a separating funnel and after adding sodium chloride (25 g) and diethyl ether (50 mL), the separating funnel was shaken for 20 minutes. The diethyl ether layer was recovered and the remaining aqueous layer was put into a separating funnel; after adding diethyl ether (50 mL) again, the separating funnel was shaken for 20 minutes and the diethyl ether layer was recovered. The diethyl ether layer obtained in a total of 100 mL was returned to the separating funnel; after rinsing the separating funnel with distilled water (50 mL), the diethyl ether layer was recovered and sodium sulfate (30 g) was added; the mixture was dehydrated and concentrated to 1 mL by the KD (Kuderna-Danish) concentration method; the concentrate was introduced into GC-MS for detecting ethyl isovalerate. The GC-MS conditions were as follows. <GC-MS Conditions> Apparatus: 6890N (GC)+5973inert (MS), product of Agilent Column: MACH HP-INNOWAX (10 m*0.20 mm*0.20 μm), product of GERSTEL Column temperature: 40° C. (3 min)˜50° C./min˜250° C. (10 min) Carrier gas: He Injection port temperature: 250° C. Transfer line: 250° C. Ionization source temperature: 230° C. Scan parameter: m/z=35˜350 SIM parameter: m/z=70, 88, 102 For example, fermented coffee beans may be obtained by either one of the following methods: 1) Coffee cherries as harvested are contacted with a microorganism to ferment and then husked (polished) by either the wash or non-wash method. 2) Coffee cherries as harvested are dried either in the sun or by mechanical means and then contacted with a microorganism to ferment and husked (polished) by either the wash or non-wash method. 3) Coffee cherries as harvested are dried in the sun while they are subjected to microbial fermentation and then husked (polished). 4) Coffee cherries as harvested are stripped of the pulp in a depulper and charged into a water tank where they are stripped of the mucilage adhering to the parchment while at the same time they are subjected to microbial fermentation in the presence of added nutritive substances that can be metabolized by the microorganism used and they are then dried either in the sun or by mechanical means and husked. Contact with a microorganism may be effected either artificially by adding it, or by making use of a microorganism attached to coffee cherries at their surfaces or the like. In the case of artificial contact with a microorganism, exemplary microorganisms that can be used include yeasts such as yeasts for wine fermentation (e.g., yeasts of strain Lalvin L2323 (Setin Co., Ltd.) and CK S102 strain (BioSpringer), both belonging to the species Cerevisiae in the genus Saccharomyces , and of the species bayanus in the genus Saccharomyces ), yeasts for beer fermentation, and baker's yeast; lactic acid bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus , and Oenococcus ; aspergilli such as ones used to make sake, shouchu (Japanese distilled liquor), and miso (Japanese fermented soybean paste); and deuteromycetes, or microorganisms belonging to the genus Geotrichum . Examples of microorganisms belonging to the genus Geotrichum include Geotrichum candidum, Geotrichum rectangulatum, Geotrichum klebahnii , and Geotrichum sp., with Geotrichum sp. SAM2421 (International Deposit Number: FERM BP-10300) or its variants being particularly advantageous. These microorganisms belonging to the genus Geotrichum can be obtained as isolates from coffee cherries. Contact with a microorganism can be effected either by spraying or dusting coffee cherries with the microorganism or by immersing coffee cherries in a suspension of the microorganism. The fermentation conditions may be chosen as appropriate for the particular microorganism to be used. As mentioned above, microorganisms belonging to the genus Geotrichum or Saccharomyces can be found on coffee cherries, so instead of performing artificial microbial fermentation as by contact with a microorganism, the behavior of such microorganisms belonging to the genus Geotrichum or Saccharomyces may simply be controlled for fermentation to produce fermented coffee beans. The regions of coffee cherry production are largely divided into two groups, one being regions such as Yemen and Brazil where the harvest season is dry and there is no need to worry about rain, and the other being regions such as Latin America, Africa and Asia where high humidity prolongs the time to dry in the sun. In the first group of regions including Yemen and Brazil, fermented coffee beans can be produced artificially by the above-described methods 1), 2) or 4), preferably method 1) or 2); in the second group of regions including Latin America, Africa and Asia, fermented coffee beans can be produced not only by the artificial means but also by the above-described method 3), where coffee cherries as harvested are dried in the sun while they are fermented with the aid of the microorganism attached to the surfaces of the cherries. Note that to perform “fermentation” in the sense of the term used in the present invention, it is important to control the growth conditions for the above-mentioned microorganisms in such a way as to prevent “rotting”, namely to ensure that no malodor as from sulfides or ammonia will develop. In the case of method 3), to ensure that no rotting will occur, it is important that the coffee cherries to be dried in the sun (i.e., for microbial fermentation) should be protected against rotting by taking a suitable means such as piling up the coffee cherries in a thickness not exceeding a certain level (say, 10 cm or less), laying them out in a thin layer (say, 5 cm or less) immediately after the start of drying and gradually increasing its thickness (say, between 5 and 10 cm) as their water content decreases, or regularly turning the piles of coffee cherries (say, once an hour). The roasted coffee beans of the present invention may be treated such that they comprise, at least as a part of them, the fermented coffee beans described above, preferably the coffee beans subjected to fermentation and roasting (which are hereinafter referred to as “fermented, roasted coffee beans”), whereby ethyl isovalerate effective for providing improved keeping quality which is the principal objective of the present invention can be incorporated. The timing of this treatment is not limited and two methods may be exemplified; in one method, fermented green coffee beans are mixed with the unfermented green coffee beans that are to be stored and the mixture is then roasted (this may be called pre-blending); and in the other method, fermented, roasted coffee beans are mixed with other roasted coffee beans (this may be called after-blending). Whether the pre-blending or after-blending method is performed, the fermented coffee beans are desirably roasted to give an L value of about 16-30, preferably about 18-22. In roasting that gives an L value less than 16, the resulting cyclic dipeptides and other substances might impair the effectiveness of ethyl isovalerate which is the effective component of the present invention. The characteristic aroma of ethyl isovalerate or coffee beans (preferably fermented, roasted coffee beans) containing ethyl isovalerate is useful in masking the oxidation smell. Hence, the roasted coffee beans of the present invention which are at least partly mixed with the coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate can be stored in the air, suffering only a small change in the aroma of coffee and maintaining the preferable coffee aroma. The content of ethyl isovalerate is such that when the roasted coffee beans to be stored are subjected to measurement by the above-described GC-MS for detecting ethyl isovalerate, the concentration of ethyl isovalerate relative to the total quantity of roasted coffee beans (which, in the case where ethyl isovalerate is directly added to the roasted coffee beans to be stored, refers to the total quantity of those roasted coffee beans, and in the case where the roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate are incorporated in the roasted coffee beans to be stored, refers to the sum of the two types of roasted coffee beans) is desirably at least 10 ppb, preferably at least 30 ppb, more preferably at least 50 ppb. Unless it is incorporated in an amount of at least 10 ppb, ethyl isovalerate is not adequately effective in controlling a possible deterioration in the quality of the roasted coffee beans during storage in the air. As the content of ethyl isovalerate increases, the keeping quality of the roasted coffee beans is improved but, on the other hand, the characteristic smell of ethyl isovalerate which is reminiscent of fruits might interfere with the aroma of coffee; hence, the upper limit of the content of ethyl isovalerate is about 200 ppb, preferably about 160 ppb, more preferably about 100 ppb. If ethyl isovalerate is to be incorporated in the form of fermented, roasted coffee beans, the latter may be added in such an amount that ethyl isovalerate is incorporated in the proportions indicated above; typically, the proportion of the fermented, roasted coffee beans to be incorporated is at least 1 wt %, preferably at least 5 wt %, of the roasted coffee beans in their entirety (the sum of the weight of the roasted coffee beans to be stored and that of the fermented, roasted coffee beans). There is substantially no upper limit for the proportion of the fermented, roasted coffee beans to be incorporated, and it may be adjusted to 100 wt % in order to provide roasted coffee beans having very good keeping quality; however, from the viewpoint of flavor, they are preferably blended with unfermented, roasted coffee beans in proportions that are preferably 50 wt % or less, more preferably 30 wt % or less. Compared to ethyl isovalerate as a pure product (which may be a synthetic product), the use of the fermented, roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate is effective not only in masking the oxidation smell of the roasted coffee beans to be stored but they are also capable of enhancing the flavor of the beans. The mechanism for this phenomenon is not known but ethyl acetate and/or ethanol that are components in the characteristic aroma of the fermented coffee beans would contribute a lot. Hence, the fermented, roasted coffee beans have to be controlled in terms of fermentation and roasting so that they will contain specified amounts of ethyl acetate and ethanol. Specifically, the ethyl acetate content is at least 5 ppm, preferably at least 10 ppm, more preferably at least 20 ppm, even more preferably at least 30 ppm, and most preferably at least 40 ppm; the ethanol content is at least 500 ppm, preferably at least 600 ppm, and more preferably at least 1000 ppm. The values of ethyl acetate and ethanol contents noted above are those obtained by making a compositional analysis of the gas in the headspace of a gas chromatographic (GC) sample tube charged with fermented, roasted whole (yet to be ground) coffee beans. The conditions for GC analysis are as follows. (GC Analysis Conditions) Apparatus: Agilent 7694 HeadspaceSampler (product of Agilent Technologies) Agilent 6890 GC System (product of Agilent Technologies) Column: HP-INNOWAX (60 mm×0.25 mm i.d.×0.25 μm in film thickness) Temperature: held at 40° C. for 4 min, raised at 3° C./min up to 220° C., and held at 230° C. for 30 min Detectors: MSD, FID Ethyl acetate and ethanol are components that are barely detectable in unfermented green coffee beans and unfermented, roasted coffee beans. These components have higher vapor pressures than water and are easy to evaporate, but in the case where they are allowed to occur in green coffee beans as the result of fermentation, they are less likely to evaporate and much of them will remain in the coffee beans even after roasting at 200-300° C. In view of these observations, it may be said that ethyl acetate and ethanol are compounds that are specifically produced and incorporated in coffee beans upon fermentation. The ethyl acetate and ethanol that remain in the fermented coffee beans also exhibit effectiveness in suppressing the scattering of major aroma components in the roasted coffee beans, such as furfuryl alcohol, 5-methylfurfural, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, ethylpyrazine, phenol, and 2-acetylpyrrole. In addition, when a coffee extract is obtained from the fermented, roasted coffee beans, ethyl acetate dissolves out in the extract which then exhibits the inherent volatility of ethyl acetate, creating a blooming top note. In other words, the fermented, roasted coffee beans enhance the aroma of coffee in the coffee extract while, at the same time, they exhibit effectiveness in improving the quality of the coffee extract by imparting body (richness) to the taste. Roasted Coffee Beans in Container In the present invention, the roasted coffee beans described above that contain ethyl isovalerate or roasted coffee beans containing said roasted coffee beans (preferably fermented, roasted coffee beans) are adapted to be in such a mode that they are accommodated in a container, preferably in such a state that said roasted coffee beans are in contact with the air. An advantageous characteristic of this mode is that the aroma of coffee will suffer only a small degree of scattering and the occurrence of oxidation is also limited during prolonged storage, not only under favorable conditions but also in the air which is a hostile condition against the roasted coffee beans. The term “the air” as used herein means oxygen-containing air, and it specifically refers to air that contains oxygen in a sufficient amount to cause oxidative degradation of the roasted coffee beans (say, at least 10 v/v %, preferably at least 15 v/v %, of the total volume of the air), and the “storage in the air” refers to such a state that the roasted coffee beans are stored in an oxygen-containing air atmosphere for a period of about one day to about six months, preferably about one day to about three months, more preferably about one day to about one month. The “roasted coffee beans accommodated in a container in such a state that they are in contact with the air” refers to those coffee beans that have been roasted with a roaster or by retailers of coffee beans or at cafés or at home and which are not subsequently processed by any means such as purging with nitrogen or evacuation but are simply placed in containers (e.g., pouch, can, and bin) that allow them to be stored in contact with the air. Roasted coffee beans that are sold on the market after a certain treatment such as purging with nitrogen or evacuation and which are opened at home and transferred into storage containers (e.g., pouch, can, and bin) that make contact with the air shall also be encompassed by the “roasted coffee beans accommodated in a container in such a state that they are in contact with the air.” It should be noted that the container to be used in the present invention is not limited to a sealed container. Roasted coffee beans in a container are either yet-to-be ground beans or powdered coffee which is prepared by grinding roasted coffee beans into granules or fine particles. The process for producing powdered coffee is not particularly limited and known grinding means such as coffee mills, grinders, mortars, and grindstones may be employed. The production of powdered coffee involves problems such as the scattering of most of the coffee aroma during grinding and accelerated deterioration of quality due to aerial oxidation that results from the increase in surface area upon grinding; the roasted coffee beans of the present invention that contain the fermented, roasted coffee beans are less likely to undergo these instances of quality deterioration during and after grinding. As already noted, mixing with the fermented, roasted coffee beans may be effected on any timing, but in the case of powdered coffee, from the viewpoint of suppressing deterioration in quality during grinding, mixing is preferably done before grinding. The powdered coffee thus obtained is suppressed in the scattering of aroma during and after grinding and it is less likely to undergo oxidation; hence, the powdered coffee according to the present invention has a heretofore-unattainable rich aroma. EXAMPLES On the following pages, the present invention will be explained in greater detail by Examples which are by no means intended to limit the present invention. Example 1 Production of Fermented Coffee Beans (1) Fermented coffee beans were produced by the following steps: 1) a vapor treatment step for treating coffee cherries with vapor at 90-110° C. for 15-30 seconds; 2) a step for cooling to 30-40° C.; 3) a pH adjustment step for adding adipic acid or lactic acid in an amount of 0.05-0.5 wt % on the basis of the weight of the coffee cherries, thereby adjusting the pH of the outer skins of the coffee cherries to between 3 and 4; 4) a microorganism attaching step for attaching a microorganism for fermentation either simultaneously with or subsequent to the pH adjustment step; 5) a culture step at 30-40° C. for 48-72 hours; 6) a drying step for drying the cultured coffee cherries; and 7) a separating/refining step for separating the coffee pulp from the coffee seeds to obtain fermented coffee beans. To be more specific, 100 kg of fresh coffee cherries (of Brazilian Arabica) were provided and carried on a conveyor capable of speed adjustment and equipped with a tunnel-type vapor introducing section, thereby performing the above step 1) at a temperature of 100° C. for a period of 20 seconds. Subsequently, cold air was supplied to quench the coffee cherries to 40° C. (step 2)). Fifty grams of dried cells of strain Lalvin EC1118 ( Saccharomyces bayanus ; yeast for wine fermentation) were dissolved in 200 g of water to prepare a yeast solution, which was added together with 100 g of adipic acid to 100 kg of the coffee cherries so that the yeast would be evenly attached to the coffee cherries at a concentration of 1.0×10 6-7 cells per coffee cherry (steps 3) and 4)). The coffee cherries were left to stand at 35° C. for 72 hours to ferment (step 5)) and thereafter dried with a dryer (step 6)), stripped of the pulp with a husker to obtain fermented coffee beans (green beans) (step 7)), which were then fed into a horizontal drum type roaster (supplied with hot air) where they were medium-roasted (L value: 20.5) to obtain fermented, roasted coffee beans (sample 1). Fermented, roasted coffee beans (sample 2) were obtained by repeating the same procedure as taken for sample 1, except for the following: 1000 g of fresh coffee cherries were provided; the vapor treatment in step 1) was performed at 100° C. for 15 seconds; the microorganism used in step 3) was a lactic acid bacterium for yoghurt production ( Lactobacillus acidophilus ); the concentration of the attached lactic acid bacterium was 1.0×10 7-8 cells per coffee cherry; and no adipic acid was used. Fermented, roasted coffee beans (sample 3) were obtained by repeating the above procedure, except that the lactic acid bacterium for yoghurt production was replaced by a fungus for shochu production ( Aspergillus kawachii ) and that the concentration of the attached fungus was 1.0×10 3-4 cells per coffee cherry. Each sample of the fermented, roasted coffee beans was not ground but put as such (assuming their initial shape) into a gas chromatographic (GC) sample tube in an amount of 10 g, and the gas in the headspace was analyzed for its components. As it turned out, samples 1, 2 and 3 contained ethyl acetate in respective amounts of 65 ppm, 63 ppm and 68 ppm, and ethanol in respective amounts of 3100 ppm, 3200 ppm, and 630 ppm. The conditions for GC analysis were as follows. (GC Analysis Conditions) Apparatus: Agilent 7694 HeadspaceSampler (product of Agilent Technologies) Agilent 6890 GC System (product of Agilent Technologies) Column: HP-INNOWAX (60 mm×0.25 mm i.d.×0.25 μM in film thickness) Temperature: held at 40° C. for 4 min, raised at 3° C./min up to 220° C., and held at 230° C. for 30 min Detectors: MSD, FID Example 2 Production of Fermented Coffee Beans (1) In Guatemala, wash polishing is usually applied to obtain green coffee beans from coffee cherries. To be more specific, harvested coffee cherries are charged into a water tank and stripped of any impurities; thereafter, they are stripped of the pulp in a depulper and charged again into a water tank where they are stripped of the mucilage adhering to the parchment; the coffee cherries are thereafter dried either in the sun or by mechanical means and husked. This procedure is an unavoidable choice since coffee plants are cultivated on mountain slopes and there are no places where harvested coffee cherries can be spread for drying. In contrast, in Brazil and other regions that have vast flat areas where coffee cherries can be dried in large amounts at a time and in which the harvest season is dry and there is no need to worry about rain, non-wash polishing is applied (also known as the “natural” polishing). To be more specific, harvested coffee cherries are immediately spread in patios and after being dried in the sun, they are husked with the dried pulp remaining attached; this procedure is characterized in that complex flavor, aroma and body are imparted to green coffee beans while they are dried over a long enough time. In Example 2, however, an experiment was conducted in Guatemala to obtain green coffee beans by non-wash polishing. To be more specific, harvested coffee cherries were piled up in a thickness not exceeding a certain level (5 cm or less), with the layer being gradually made thicker (5-10 cm) as their water content decreased, and the piles of coffee cherries were turned once an hour, whereby the coffee cherries were dried to a water content of 10% or less over a period of 2 weeks, and thereafter husked to obtain green coffee beans (sample 4). Analysis of the resulting green coffee beans as in Example 1 verified that they contained ethyl acetate and ethanol. Analysis for ethyl isovalerate by the method to be described later also verified the presence of ethyl isovalerate. Example 3 Storage Test on Roasted Coffee Beans (1) 1. Sensory Evaluation of Roasted Coffee Beans Coffee beans of Brazilian Arabica were fed into a horizontal drum type roaster (supplied with hot air) where they were medium-roasted (L value: 19.5) to obtain roasted coffee beans, to which an ethanol solution of ethyl isovalerate (product of Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was added in such amounts that the content of ethyl isovalerate relative to the total quantity of the roasted coffee beans would be 10, 30, 50, 100 and 200 ppb (v/w) (the resulting mixtures are respectively referred to as the 10-ppb added sample, 30-ppb added sample, 50-ppb added sample, 100-ppb added sample, and the 200-ppb added sample). After stirring at ordinary temperature for several minutes, the respective samples were heated with stirring on a hot plate at about 100° C. for about 20 minutes, and this step of heating with stirring was terminated when the roasted coffee beans weighed almost the same as they did before the addition of the ethanol solution. Each sample of the roasted coffee beans weighing 120 g was put into an aluminum pouch (product name: Lamijip AL-12) having a capacity of about 300 mL and subjected to a storage test, with the empty space kept to a minimum. The volume of the air within the aluminum pouch was about 20 mL. The storage test was conducted in a refrigerator (5° C.), a 37° C. thermostatic chamber, and a 55° C. thermostatic chamber. As a control, a sample containing no ethyl isovalerate (non-addition sample) was subjected to the same storage test. After the storage, the pouches were opened, and the aroma from within each pouch was rated by four expert panelists on a 4-score scale as regards the presence or absence of deterioration smell (the intensity of oxidation smell), and the average of the scores was calculated. The results are shown in Table 1. As is clear from Table 1, the control (non-addition sample) did not develop any sensible oxidation smell after storage in a refrigerator for about 20 days, but it developed oxidation smell when stored at temperatures higher than ordinary temperature. By adding ethyl isovalerate at 10 ppb (v/w) and more relative to the total quantity of the roasted coffee beans, the oxidation smell could be suppressed (masked) and it was barely sensible when ethyl isovalerate was added at 30 ppb (v/w) and more. TABLE 1 Ethyl isovalerate 5° C. × 37° C. × 55° C. × Level (No.) (ppb) 3 wk 3 wk 1 wk Non-addition sample 0 0 2.0 2.5 10-ppb added sample 10 0 0.8 1.4 30-ppb added sample 30 0 0.6 0.9 50-ppb added sample 50 0 0.4 0.7 100-ppb added sample 100 0 0.1 0.2 200-ppb added sample 200 0 0 0.1 (Scores for the rating of oxidation smell) Sensible, strong (3.0); sensible, distinct (2.0); sensible, slight (1.0); not sensible (0) 2. Sensory Evaluation of Coffee Extracts Next, coffee extracts were obtained from the aforementioned samples of roasted coffee beans containing ethyl isovalerate and the control (non-addition sample) of roasted coffee beans, each having been stored at 5° C. (for 3 weeks) and 55° C. (for 1 week), and the extracts were subjected to cup testing. To make the coffee extracts, the ground coffee beans were charged into a commercial coffee mill (product name: BONMAC; Model No. BM570N) and medium-ground (with the dial on the coffee mill set to MEDIUM) and, thereafter, 65 g of boiling water was poured over 5 g of the ground coffee particles (powdered coffee) for extraction in the usual manner. The thus prepared coffee extracts were subjected to sensory evaluation (cup test) by four expert panelists. In this evaluation, a coffee extract obtained from the roasted coffee beans (non-addition sample) before storage was used as a control, and the preference over the control (as regards the aroma of coffee and the intensity of the body of coffee) was rated on a 5-score scale and the average of the scores was calculated. In addition, the intensity of the taste due to the deterioration of roasted coffee beans (deterioration smell: the intensity of oxidation smell and the astringency of aftertaste) was rated on a 4-score scale and the average of the scores was calculated. The results of the rating of preference are shown in Table 2. When ethyl isovalerate was added at 30 ppb (v/w) and more, the aroma of coffee became stronger with the increase in its addition, with the result that the body of coffee had been imparted. In particular, the top note had a blooming aroma. After the storage at 55° C., all samples from roasted coffee beans deteriorated in both the aroma and body of coffee; however, the samples from roasted coffee beans to which ethyl isovalerate had been added at 30 ppb (v/w) and more were satisfactory from a sensory viewpoint, since they had aroma and body at least comparable to those of the non-addition sample before the storage. TABLE 2 Ethyl Aroma of coffee Body of coffee isovalerate 5° C. × 55° C. × 5° C. × 55° C. × Level (No.) (ppb) 3 wk 1 wk 3 wk 1 wk Non-addition 0 0 −1.0 0 −1.0 sample 10-ppb added 10 0 −0.5 0 −1.0 sample 30-ppb added 30 0.5 0 0.5 0 sample 50-ppb added 50 1.5 1.0 1.0 0.5 sample 100-ppb added 100 1.5 1.0 1.0 0.5 sample 200-ppb added 200 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 sample (Rating scores) Strong (2.0); fairly strong (1.0); no change (0); fairly weak (−1); weak (−2) The results of the rating of deterioration smell are shown in Table 3, from which it is clear that as in the rating of the aroma of roasted coffee beans (Table 1), the non-addition sample of coffee extract also developed sensible deterioration smell (the oxidation smell and the astringency of aftertaste) due to the deterioration in quality; on the other hand, the sample with ethyl isovalerate added at 10 ppb (v/w) was suppressed in deterioration smell compared to the non-addition sample, and the deterioration smell of the 30-ppb (v/w) added sample was barely sensible; in particular, all panelists responded that they did not sense any deterioration smell in the 50-ppb (v/w) added sample. However, the coffee extracts prepared from the sample of roasted coffee beans with ethyl isovalerate added at 200 ppb were not highly rated by some panelists who felt that the aroma of ethyl isovalerate interfered with the aroma of coffee. This suggested that the upper limit for the content of ethyl isovalerate was about 200 ppb.

Sensory Evaluation of Roasted Coffee Beans Coffee beans of Brazilian Arabica were fed into a horizontal drum type roaster (supplied with hot air) where they were medium-roasted (L value: 20.0) to obtain roasted coffee beans, in which the fermented, roasted coffee beans produced (as sample 1) in Example 1 were incorporated in such amounts that their content relative to the total quantity of the coffee beans would be 1, 5 and 30 wt % (the resulting mixtures are respectively referred to as the 1% blended sample, 5% blended sample, and the 30% blended sample). Each sample of the roasted coffee beans containing the fermented, roasted coffee beans and weighing 120 g was put into an aluminum pouch (product name: Lamijip AL-12) having a capacity of about 300 mL, and subjected to a storage test, with the empty space kept to a minimum. The volume of the air within the aluminum pouch was about 20 mL. The storage test was conducted in a refrigerator (5° C.), a 37° C. thermostatic chamber, and a 55° C. thermostatic chamber. As a control, a sample incorporating no fermented, roasted coffee beans (non-addition sample) was subjected to the same storage test. The ethyl isovalerate in the coffee beans was detected by the following method. First, green coffee beans (5 g) were ground to a medium grind, to which distilled water (50 mL) was added for steam distillation; the resulting distillate (100 mL) was put into a separating funnel, and after adding sodium chloride (25 g) and diethyl ether (50 mL), the separating funnel was shaken for 20 minutes. The diethyl ether layer was recovered and the remaining aqueous layer was put into the separating funnel; after adding diethyl ether (50 mL) again, the separating funnel was shaken for 20 minutes, and the diethyl ether layer was recovered. The diethyl ether layer obtained in a total of 100 mL was returned to the separating funnel; after rinsing the separating funnel with distilled water (50 mL), the diethyl ether layer was recovered, and sodium sulfate (30 g) was added; the mixture was dehydrated and concentrated to 1 mL by the KD (Kuderna-Danish) concentration method; the concentrate was introduced into GC-MS. The GC-MS Conditions were as Follows. (GC-MS Conditions) Apparatus: 6890N (GC)+5973inert (MS), product of Agilent Column: MACH HP-INNOWAX (10 m*0.20 mm*0.20 μm), product of GERSTEL Column temperature: 40° C. (3 min)˜50° C./min˜250° C.

Scan parameter: m/z=35˜350 SIM parameter: m/z=70, 88, 102 The content of ethyl isovalerate in the 1% blended sample, 5% blended sample and the 30% blended sample was 6.5, 39 and 152 ppb (v/w), respectively, relative to the total quantity of the coffee beans. After the storage, the pouches were opened and the aroma from within each pouch was evaluated by four expert panelists on a 4-score scale as regards the presence or absence of deterioration smell (the intensity of oxidation smell) due to the storage, and the average of the scores was calculated. The results are shown in Table 4. As is clear from Table 4, the control (non-addition sample) did not develop any sensible oxidation smell after storage in a refrigerator for about 20 days, but it developed oxidation smell when stored at temperatures higher than ordinary temperature. By incorporating the fermented, roasted coffee beans at 1 wt % and more, the oxidation smell could be suppressed (masked), and it was barely sensible when the fermented, roasted coffee beans were incorporated at 5 wt %; particularly in the case where they were incorporated at 30 wt % and more, all panelists responded that they did not sense any oxidation smell. From these results, it was found that by incorporating the fermented, roasted coffee beans in such amounts that ethyl isovalerate would be contained at 10 ppb (v/w) and more, the oxidation smell of roasted coffee beans could be suppressed (masked), and that the oxidation smell was barely sensible when the fermented, roasted coffee beans were incorporated to give an ethyl isovalerate content of 30 ppb (v/w) and more.

Sensory Evaluation of Coffee Extracts Next, coffee extracts were obtained from the aforementioned samples of roasted coffee beans containing fermented, roasted coffee beans (containing ethyl isovalerate) and the control (non-addition sample) of roasted coffee beans, each having been stored at 5° C. and 55° C. (6 days of storage), and the extracts were subjected to cup testing. To make the coffee extracts, the ground coffee beans were charged into a commercial coffee mill (product name: BONMAC; Model No. BM570N) and medium-ground (with the dial on the coffee mill set to MEDIUM) and, thereafter, 65 g of boiling water was poured over 5 g of the ground coffee particles (powdered coffee) for extraction in the usual manner. The thus prepared coffee extracts were subjected to sensory evaluation (cup test) by four expert panelists. In this evaluation, a coffee extract obtained from the roasted coffee beans (non-addition sample) before storage was used as a control, and the preference over the control (as regards the aroma of coffee and the intensity of the body of coffee) was rated on a 5-score scale, and the average of the scores was calculated. In addition, the intensity of the taste due to the deterioration of roasted coffee beans (deterioration smell: the intensity of oxidation smell and the astringency of aftertaste) was rated on a 4-score scale, and the average of the scores was calculated. The results of the rating of preference are shown in Table 5. When the fermented, roasted coffee beans were incorporated at 5 wt % and more, the aroma of coffee became stronger with the increase in their addition, with the result that the body of coffee had been imparted. In particular, the top note had a blooming aroma. After the storage at 55° C., all samples from roasted coffee beans deteriorated in both the aroma and body of coffee; however, the samples from roasted coffee beans in which the fermented, roasted coffee beans had been incorporated at 5 wt % and more were satisfactory from a sensory viewpoint since they had aroma and body at least comparable to those of the non-addition sample before the storage. TABLE 5 Aroma of coffee Body of coffee 5° C. × 55° C. × 5° C. × 55° C. × 6 days 6 days 6 days 6 days Non-addition sample 0 −1.0 0 −1.0 1%-blended sample 0 −1.0 0 −1.0 5%-blended sample 1 0.5 1 0.5 30%-blended sample 2 1.0 2 1.0 (Rating scores) Strong (2.0); fairly strong (1.0); no change (0); fairly weak (−1); weak (−2) The results of the rating of deterioration smell are shown in Table 6, from which it is clear that as in the rating of the aroma of roasted coffee beans (Table 4), the non-addition sample (control) of coffee extract also developed sensible deterioration smell (the oxidation smell and the astringency of aftertaste) due to the deterioration in quality; on the other hand, the 1%-blended sample was suppressed in deterioration smell compared to the non-addition sample, and the deterioration smell of the 5%-blended sample was barely sensible; in particular, all panelists responded that they did not sense any deterioration smell in the 30%-blended sample. TABLE 6 Oxidation smell Astringency of aftertaste 5° C. × 55° C. × 5° C. × 55° C. × 6 days 6 days 6 days 6 days Non-addition sample 0 2.3 0 2.5 1%-blended sample 0 1.5 0 1.8 5%-blended sample 0 0.5 0 0.5 30%-blended sample 0 0.0 0 0.0 (Scores for the rating of oxidation smell) Sensible, strong (3.0); sensible, distinct (2.0); sensible, slight (1.0); not sensible (0) From the above results, one can see that in order to suppress the development of oxidation smell during prolonged storage of roasted coffee beans, it is effective to incorporate the fermented, roasted coffee beans at 1 wt % and more so that ethyl isovalerate will be contained at 10 ppb and more, and it is preferable to incorporate the fermented, roasted coffee beans at 5 wt % and more so that ethyl isovalerate will be contained at 30 ppb and more. Example 5 Storage Test on Roasted Coffee Beans (3) The fermented, roasted coffee beans produced (as sample 4) in Example 2 were incorporated in the roasted coffee beans used in Example 4, in such an amount that the content of sample 4 would be 30 wt % relative to the total quantity of the coffee beans (the content of ethyl isovalerate relative to the total quantity of the coffee beans: 10.2 ppb). The resulting blend was subjected to a storage test at 55° C. as in Example 4. As a control, roasted coffee beans incorporating no fermented coffee beans (the content of ethyl isovalerate relative to the total quantity of the coffee beans: 0 ppb) were also subjected to a storage test. After the storage, the aroma of the roasted coffee beans was evaluated and coffee extracts from them were also evaluated by cup testing, both ratings being conducted as in Example 4. The coffee beans incorporating the fermented, roasted coffee beans were markedly suppressed in oxidation smell compared to the non-addition sample of coffee beans, and the results of the cup testing showed the following: the coffee beans incorporating the fermented, roasted coffee beans enhanced the preferred flavor characteristics of coffee (i.e., aroma, body, and lingering aftertaste) and were capable of suppressing the unpleasant flavors (astringency and oxidation smell) that accompanied the deterioration upon storage; all panelists responded that they had great preference for the coffee beverage brewed from the coffee beans incorporating the fermented coffee beans.","20110250339"

STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable BACKGROUND Many people enjoy drinking coffee as part of a daily routine. However, preparing coffee is time-consuming and can be an inefficient use of time and energy (including electrical energy) when only a single cup is to be prepared. Meanwhile, coffee makers that are designed to prepare a single cup of coffee using a single-serve ground coffee container (e.g. a Keurig® K-Cup® pod) produce an enormous amount of waste that is harmful to the environment. The result of single use K-Cup type plastic pods is that the planet is literally being destroyed. Tens of billions of plastic pods end up in landfills annually. If the discarded plastic pods are placed end-to-end, they would circle the globe 12 times! This means that the waste problem is growing and will grow as more companies and unless mitigated will continue to cause problems exponentially for our planet. BRIEF SUMMARY The present disclosure contemplates various systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee. By way of example in non-limitation, a liquid coffee concentrate may be disposed within a container (i.e., pod). The container may be fabricated from a plastic material or a food grade biodegradable paper. With the pod being sized and configured to be insertable into a single serve coffee maker such a Keurig, the waste (i.e., plastic housing) coffee pod is minimal or less than that of a traditional Keurig coffee pod because less volume of liquid coffee concentrate is required to make a single cup of coffee compared to the volume required to brew coffee from coffee grinds as is the case with the Keurig pods, and thus, the coffee pod with the liquid coffee concentrate can be smaller and produce less waste. As will be discussed herein, because the coffee pod with the liquid coffee concentrate is smaller compared to the Keurig coffee pod, an adapter may be used to allow the smaller sized coffee pod with the liquid coffee concentrate to be used within a traditional single serve coffee maker such as a Keurig. Alternatively, it is also contemplated that in lieu of a coffee pod with a liquid coffee concentrate, a thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product can be inserted into the adapter or holder where the coffee pod would normally sit. When the hot water is running through the single serve coffee maker, the hot water dissolves the dissolvable coffee product first to brew the coffee. A first portion of the volume of the hot water dissolves the dissolvable coffee product. However, a later second portion of the volume of the hot water may sanitize and clean the interior surfaces of the holder or adapter so that the user does not have to clean the holder or adapter or remove any remaining portion of the coffee product from the single serve coffee maker. This as a level of convenience to the user, which has not been previously achieved by the traditional single serve coffee makers. More particularly, an amount of liquid coffee concentrate to prepare an individual serving of coffee is packaged in a sealed food grade paper container. Unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods, the sealed food grade paper container of liquid coffee concentrate does not need to contain a filter since the process of preparing coffee from a liquid coffee concentrate involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds. Due to the absence of a filter and the concentrated nature of liquid coffee concentrate, the sealed food grade paper container of liquid coffee concentrate can be very small, for example, sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. A single sealed food grade paper container of liquid coffee concentrate can be used to prepare a serving of coffee using an existing coffee maker (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker) designed for single-serve ground coffee containers (e.g. Keurig® K-Cup® pods). An adapter may be provided for receiving the sealed food grade paper container of liquid coffee concentrate and positioning the sealed food grade paper container in the coffee maker. When the coffee maker is operated, an upper portion of the sealed food grade paper container may be pierced by a needle of the coffee maker to allow heated water to flow into the sealed food grade paper container. A lower portion of the sealed food grade paper container may be pierced by a needle of the adapter or may be otherwise compromised to allow the combined liquid coffee concentrate and hot water to flow out of the sealed food grade paper container and into a user's coffee cup. In accordance with one embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. The system includes a sealed food grade paper container containing an amount of liquid coffee concentrate for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee and a coffee maker operable to prepare a single serving of coffee from the liquid coffee concentrate contained in the sealed food grade paper container. The coffee maker includes a coffee maker recess for receiving the sealed food grade paper container, a first coffee maker needle for piercing an entrance hole in an upper portion of the sealed food grade paper container while the sealed food grade paper container is in the coffee maker recess, a water conduit by which water from a water source flows into the sealed food grade paper container through the entrance hole, and a heater for heating the water. The system may include an adapter for receiving the sealed food grade paper container and positioning the sealed food grade paper container in the coffee maker recess, the coffee maker recess receiving the sealed food grade paper container while the sealed food grade paper container is in the adapter. The adapter may include an adapter recess for receiving the sealed food grade paper container, and an exterior sized to fit the coffee maker recess. The adapter may include an adapter needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed food grade paper container when the sealed food grade paper container is pressed into the adapter recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed food grade paper container. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container through the exit hole. The sealed food grade paper container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by the heater. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The coffee maker may include a second coffee maker needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed food grade paper container when the sealed food grade paper container is pressed into the coffee maker recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed food grade paper container. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container through the exit hole. The sealed food grade paper container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed food grade paper container may have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. In accordance with another embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate and a coffee maker having a coffee maker recess for receiving a single-serve ground coffee container. The system includes a sealed food grade paper container containing an amount of liquid coffee concentrate for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, and an adapter for receiving the sealed food grade paper container and positioning the sealed food grade paper container in the coffee maker recess. The adapter includes an upper portion having an adapter recess for receiving the sealed food grade paper container, and an exterior sized to fit the coffee maker recess. The adapter may include an adapter needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed food grade paper container when the sealed food grade paper container is pressed into the adapter recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed food grade paper container. A combination of the liquid coffee concentrate and water from the coffee maker may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container through the exit hole. The sealed food grade paper container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by a heater of the coffee maker. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The sealed food grade paper container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed food grade paper container may have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. In accordance with another embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. The system includes a sealed food grade paper container, and liquid coffee concentrate inside the sealed food grade paper container in an amount for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee. The sealed food grade paper container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by a heater of a coffee maker. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The sealed food grade paper container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed food grade paper container may have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. Another aspect of the present disclosure contemplates systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a formed (e.g. molded or otherwise given some shape on a scale larger than a particle or granule) soluble coffee product. A formed soluble coffee product is prepared in the shape of a wafer, ball, or other shape, including an amount of soluble coffee (i.e. instant coffee) to prepare an individual serving of coffee. The formed soluble coffee product is placed in a food grade paper container having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and the food grade paper container is placed in a coffee maker, such as an existing coffee maker (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker) designed for single-serve ground coffee containers (e.g. Keurig® K-Cup® pods). A cap with an orifice may be provided that fits on the food grade paper container. When the coffee maker is operated, the orifice in the cap may receive a needle of the coffee maker to allow heated water to flow into the food grade paper container. As the heated water dissolves the formed soluble coffee product, the combined soluble coffee and hot water may flow out of the food grade paper container via the one or more holes and into a user's coffee cup. The process of preparing coffee from the formed soluble coffee product involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds, and the food grade paper container need not be pierced by a needle or otherwise compromised when dissolving the formed soluble coffee product. Therefore, the process produces no waste. Moreover, unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods, the food grade paper container holding the formed soluble coffee product does not need to contain a filter (since the process of preparing coffee from soluble coffee involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds). Due to the absence of a filter and the concentrated nature of soluble coffee, the food grade paper container can be sized to receive more than one formed soluble coffee products and/or formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products, allowing the user to mix and match to suit his/her taste and desired coffee strength. According to one embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee. The system includes one or more formed soluble coffee products and a food grade paper container having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, the one or more holes sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble coffee products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the food grade paper container. The system may further include a coffee maker operable to prepare a single serving of coffee from the one or more formed soluble coffee products, the coffee maker including a recess for receiving the food grade paper container, a water conduit by which water from a water source flows into the food grade paper container while the food grade paper container is in the recess, and a heater for heating the water. Each of the formed soluble coffee products may have one or more protrusions arranged to produce a gap between adjacent formed soluble coffee products when at least two of the one or more formed soluble coffee products are stacked in the food grade paper container. Each of the one or more formed soluble coffee products may have a dimension that completely covers the one or more holes when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the food grade paper container. The food grade paper container may include one or more stoppers that extend laterally outward from the food grade paper container in an upper portion thereof, the one or more stoppers preventing the food grade paper container from falling into the recess of the coffee maker. The recess of the coffee maker may include an exit needle positioned to pierce single-serve ground coffee food grade paper container when a single-serve ground coffee food grade paper container is placed in the coffee maker, and the one or more stoppers may prevent the food grade paper container from being pierced by the exit needle. The system may include a lid that fits on the food grade paper container and includes an orifice. The water conduit of the coffee maker may include an entrance needle that fits into the orifice of the cap. The system may include one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products. The one or more holes of the food grade paper container may be sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products are placed in the food grade paper container. According to another embodiment, there is a method of preparing an individual serving of coffee. The method includes placing one or more formed soluble coffee products in a food grade paper container having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, the one or more holes sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble coffee products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the food grade paper container. The method may further include placing the food grade paper container in a recess of a coffee maker and operating the coffee maker to cause hot water to flow into the food grade paper container until the one or more formed soluble coffee products are completely dissolved. Placing one or more formed soluble coffee products in the food grade paper container may include stacking at least two of the one or more formed soluble coffee products in the food grade paper container. Each of the formed soluble coffee products may have one or more protrusions arranged to produce a gap between adjacent formed soluble coffee products when the at least two formed soluble coffee products are stacked in the food grade paper container. Each of the one or more formed soluble coffee products may have a dimension that completely covers the one or more holes when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the food grade paper container. The food grade paper container may include one or more stoppers that extend laterally outward from the food grade paper container in an upper portion thereof, the one or more stoppers preventing the food grade paper container from falling into the recess of the coffee maker. The method may include fitting a cap on the food grade paper container, the cap including an orifice, and inserting an entrance needle of the coffee maker into the orifice of the cap. Operating the coffee maker may cause the hot water to flow into the food grade paper container via the entrance needle. The method may include dipping at least one of the one or more formed soluble coffee products in a flavor or creamer additive. The method may include placing one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products in the food grade paper container. The one or more holes of the food grade paper container may be sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products are placed in the food grade paper container. According to another embodiment, there is a method of manufacturing a formed soluble coffee product. The method includes pouring coffee into a mold, pouring a flavor or creamer additive into the mold, and thermally reducing, solidifying and dehydrating the combined coffee and additive while the coffee and additive are in the mold. The method may include brewing the coffee from ground coffee beans. The method may include grinding roasted coffee beans to produce the ground coffee beans. The method may include roasting coffee beans to produce the roasted coffee beans. The coffee may be a liquid coffee concentrate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure encompasses various embodiments of systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. A person wishing to make a single serving of coffee takes a sealed food grade paper container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and places it in a coffee maker 50 . The sealed food grade paper container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 may be very small (e.g. sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate) in comparison to single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules. The coffee maker 50 may be a Keurig®, Nespresso® or other coffee maker that is designed to be used with single-serve ground coffee containers. The sealed food grade paper container 10 may be placed inside an adapter 30 that positions the sealed food grade paper container 10 in the coffee maker 50 . The person then closes the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 down on the sealed food grade paper container 10 , causing a needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to puncture an upper portion of the sealed food grade paper container 10 and allowing heated water to flow into the sealed food grade paper container 10 through the puncture hole. A needle 38 of the adapter 30 may puncture a bottom portion of the sealed food grade paper container 10 , or the sealed food grade paper container 10 A may be designed to burst open in the bottom portion when filled with hot water, allowing the combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to flow down into the person's coffee cup. Afterward, the sealed food grade paper container 10 , which is now punctured or otherwise compromised, may be thrown away or recycled, depending on its material composition. In either case, little waste is produced because the sealed food grade paper container 10 needs no internal filter and may contain only the liquid coffee concentrate, making it much smaller than a single-serve ground coffee food grade paper container such as a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or a Nespresso® capsule. FIGS. 1 A, 1 B, and 2 are a perspective view, a side view, and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of a sealed food grade paper container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and an adapter 30 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The sealed food grade paper container 10 may contain an amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, e.g. 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The sealed food grade paper container 10 may have a generally cylindrical body 12 as shown with a protruding cap 14 that extends laterally outward relative to the body 12 (e.g. by 2-10 mm). When the sealed food grade paper container 10 is inserted into the adapter 30 , the body 12 may fit inside a recess 32 of the adapter 30 while the protruding cap 14 does not fit inside the recess 32 . In this way, the protruding cap 14 may prevent the sealed food grade paper container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 and may provide a convenient handhold for a person removing the sealed food grade paper container 10 after it has been used. The sealed food grade paper container 10 may be made of a recyclable or biodegradable material or combination of materials. For example, as shown in FIG. 2 , the sealed food grade paper container 10 may include an exterior shell 16 made of a durable paper (e.g. lightweight cardboard) that is coated with an interior coating 18 such as a waterproof wax (e.g. paraffin wax), plastic (e.g. polyethylene), or parchment. For example, the body 12 and protruding cap 14 of the sealed food grade paper container 10 may be cut, rolled, and/or folded from a sheet of the exterior shell 16 and interior coating 18 materials. The durable paper may be durable enough to allow the exterior shell 16 to maintain its form while being handled in the ordinary usage of the sealed food grade paper container 10 . The body 12 and the protruding cap 14 may both include a portion of the exterior shell 16 and a portion of the interior coating 18 . The interior coating 18 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from degrading the exterior shell 16 , thus allowing the exterior shell 16 to be made from a durable paper such as cardboard. In some cases, the interior coating 18 may not be as recyclable or biodegradable as the exterior shell 16 and may instead melt off the exterior shell 16 and into the coffee as the coffee is prepared from hot water mixing with the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . In such cases, the interior coating 18 may be made of a material that is harmless when ingested and does not appreciably affect the taste of the coffee. As noted above, the sealed food grade paper container 10 may contain, for example, 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The overall capacity of the sealed food grade paper container 10 may be equal to the amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 contained in the sealed food grade paper container 10 , or may be greater, with the remaining space filled with a quantity of air. The capacity of the sealed food grade paper container 10 may range from the minimum capacity needed to contain the desired amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 (e.g. 5 mL, but may be lower depending on the concentration of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and the desired strength of the coffee) up to a maximum capacity depending on the size of the coffee maker that the sealed food grade paper container 10 will be used with. For example, if the sealed food grade paper container 10 will be inserted in an adapter 30 inside a Keurig® coffee maker, a relatively large sealed food grade paper container 10 may have a capacity of around 40 mL. In the interest of minimizing the size of the sealed food grade paper container 10 , the capacity of the sealed food grade paper container 10 may be less than 20 mL, preferably less than 15 mL, more preferably less than 10 mL. Accounting for the material(s) of the sealed food grade paper container 10 itself, the sealed food grade paper container 10 may have an exterior volume that is slightly greater than its capacity, where the exterior volume is defined as the total volume of liquid displaced when the sealed food grade paper container 10 is submerged in the liquid. Such exterior volume may similarly range between low values around 5 mL and relatively high values around 40 mL, with the exterior volume greater than the capacity of the sealed food grade paper container 10 by an amount defined by the volume displaced by the material(s) of the sealed food grade paper container 10 . For example, assuming the material(s) of the sealed food grade paper container 10 displace 5 mL, the exterior volume of the sealed food grade paper container 10 may be less than 25 mL, preferably less than 20 mL, more preferably less than 15 mL. The recess 32 of the adapter 30 may be generally cylindrical to match the shape of the sealed food grade paper container 10 and may be wider (e.g. having a greater diameter) than the sealed food grade paper container 10 , except that the recess 32 may be narrower (e.g. having a smaller diameter) than the protruding cap 14 of the sealed food grade paper container 10 . In this way, the recess 32 may be shaped to prevent the sealed food grade paper container 10 from being inserted too far into the adapter 30 and becoming irretrievable. The exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped to fit inside an existing coffee maker in the same way that a single-serve ground coffee container fits inside the coffee maker. Thus, for example, the exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod, a Nespresso® capsule, etc., depending on which existing coffee maker the adapter 30 is designed for. It is also contemplated that the adapter 30 may be designed to universally match two or more such existing coffee makers (e.g. by matching a height dimension of one and a width dimension of another). In some cases, an existing coffee maker may have a needle positioned to pierce a lower portion of a single-serve ground coffee container. For example, a Keurig® coffee maker may have a part known as a K-Cup® holder that functions as a recess for receiving a K-Cup® pod, and the K-Cup® holder may have a part known as an exit needle that is positioned to pierce the bottom of the K-Cup® pod at a peripheral region of the K-Cup® pod. The adapter 30 may be shaped so as to avoid touching or pressing hard against such needle as shown in FIGS. 4 A and 4 B. In this regard, the adapter 30 may have a reduced height relative to the recess of the coffee maker, so as not to extend deeply enough into the recess to reach the needle, or the adapter 30 may have an exterior contour with a sloped or stepped region 34 in a lower portion thereof that slopes or steps inward to avoid the needle. Such reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 34 may symmetrically define the exterior of the adapter 30 or may occur only in a portion of the adapter 30 , e.g. as a dedicated slot to receive the needle. Meanwhile, the upper portion of the adapter 30 may have an outwardly extending lip 36 that extends laterally outward from the recess 32 in the upper portion of the adapter 30 . In this way, just as the protruding cap 14 of the sealed food grade paper container 10 may prevent the sealed food grade paper container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the lip 36 of the adapter may prevent the adapter 30 from being inserted too far into the recess of the coffee maker. By holding the adapter 30 at the top of the recess of the coffee maker, the lip 36 may allow the adapter 30 to avoid the needle of the coffee maker. As shown in FIG. 2 , the interior of the adapter 30 may include a hollow adapter needle 38 that acts as a fluid conduit between the recess 32 of the adapter 30 and the bottom of the adapter 30 . The adapter needle 38 may have a sharp point at the top and be positioned to puncture the bottom portion of the sealed food grade paper container 10 when the sealed food grade paper container 10 is pressed down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . The adapter 30 may be made of a hard plastic such as polypropylene and may be manufactured by injection molding, with the adapter needle 38 made of a metal alloy such as stainless steel or carbon steel. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the sealed food grade paper container 10 and the adapter 30 with the sealed food grade paper container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 . As shown in FIG. 3 , the sealed food grade paper container 10 may fit snugly in the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , with the recess 32 of the adapter 30 slightly larger than the sealed food grade paper container 10 . In the case of a cylindrical sealed food grade paper container 10 and a cylindrical recess 32 , the recess 32 may have an inner diameter that is slightly greater (e.g. 2-10 mm) than the exterior diameter of the sealed food grade paper container 10 . When the sealed food grade paper container 10 is placed inside the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the sealed food grade paper container 10 may initially come to rest on top of the adapter needle 38 without being punctured. In this way, the sealed food grade paper container 10 may be positioned in the adapter 30 (before or after the adapter is placed inside the coffee maker) without prematurely releasing the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from the sealed food grade paper container 10 . FIGS. 4 A and 4 B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of the sealed food grade paper container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 with the adapter 30 placed inside the coffee maker 50 , with FIG. 4 A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 4 B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. In FIG. 4 A, the sealed food grade paper container 10 is resting on top of the adapter needle 38 as in FIG. 3 . Meanwhile, the entire adapter 30 is positioned inside a recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The illustrated recess 52 is a K-Cup® holder as used in Keurig® coffee makers, including an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) and a funnel part 56 . As can be seen, the adapter 30 is positioned in the recess 52 so as to avoid an exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . In the example of FIGS. 4 A and 4 B, the full height of the adapter 30 is great enough to extend down past the tip of the exit needle 55 while the lip 36 of the adapter 30 rests on the outside of the recess 52 . In this example, the adapter 30 can still avoid the exit needle 55 due to its exterior contour having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as shown. In addition to the recess 52 (having the exit needle part 54 and the funnel part 56 ), the coffee maker 50 shown in FIGS. 4 A and 4 B has a lid 58 (see FIG. 4 B), a water conduit 60 , a pump 62 , and a heater 64 . The water conduit 60 provides water for making a cup of coffee. For example, water from a water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed food grade paper container 10 as described in more detail below. The water source 61 may be, for example, a fillable water tank of the coffee maker 60 . The pump 62 may pump the water from the water source 61 to the sealed food grade paper container 10 via the water conduit 60 , and the heater 64 may heat the water. For example, the heater 64 may heat the water while the water is at the water source 61 (e.g. in a water tank) or while the water is flowing to the sealed food grade paper container 10 (e.g. as the water flows through piping or tubing or one or more heating tanks of the water conduit 60 ). Thus, the heater 64 may heat only the amount of water needed for an individual cup of coffee or may heat a larger batch of water. The heater 64 may be an electric heater that heats the water by Joule heating. It is also contemplated that the water source 61 may be a connection to a cold water line of a building, similar to that used by a refrigerator that has a water dispenser or ice maker. In this case, the pump 62 may be omitted as the pressure in the water line is used to bring the water to the sealed food grade paper container 10 via the water conduit 60 . The lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 has an entrance needle 66 for piercing a hole in an upper portion of the sealed food grade paper container 10 while the sealed food grade paper container 10 is in the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The entrance needle 66 may be hollow and act as a part of the water conduit 60 (e.g. with an upper end of the entrance needle 66 connected to tubing or piping of the water conduit 60 ). In this way, the water from the water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed food grade paper container 10 through the tip of the entrance needle 66 after the entrance needle 66 punctures the hole in the sealed food grade paper container 10 . To this end, the entrance needle 66 may have a sharp point at the bottom and be positioned to puncture the top portion of the sealed food grade paper container 10 when the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed food grade paper container 10 sitting into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . As the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed food grade paper container 10 , a bottom face 68 of the lid 58 may abut against the sealed food grade paper container 10 to press the sealed food grade paper container 10 down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . In this way, the action of the lid 58 may, in addition to causing the entrance needle 66 to pierce the upper portion of the sealed food grade paper container 10 , cause the sealed food grade paper container 10 to press against the tip of the adapter needle 38 so that the adapter needle 38 punctures the lower portion of the sealed food grade paper container 10 . The adapter needle 38 may have an internal passage 40 with an inlet 42 near the point of the adapter needle 38 where the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed food grade paper container 10 and an outlet 44 at the bottom of the adapter 30 . When the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed food grade paper container 10 , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 42 , through the internal passage 40 , and out of the outlet 44 and into the person's coffee cup where additional mixing of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may occur. Just below the inlet 42 , a gasket 46 may be provided to function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may be angled upward so as to function as a funnel that directs any fluid leaving through the puncture hole into the inlet 42 of the internal passage 40 of the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may also function as a seal against the sealed food grade paper container 10 . For example, the sealed food grade paper container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the height of the sealed food grade paper container 10 below the protruding cap 14 matches the depth of the gasket 46 within the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . More specifically, the gasket 46 may be made of a flexible material (e.g. rubber) that is capable of bending downward as the sealed food grade paper container 10 presses down on it, so as to remain in contact with the sealed food grade paper container 10 for a range of depths (spanning 1-5 mm, for example). The sealed food grade paper container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the bottom of the sealed food grade paper container 10 falls within this range of depths when the protruding cap 14 rests on the adapter 30 outside the recess 32 . In this way, it may be assured that the bottom of the sealed food grade paper container 10 presses against the gasket 46 , with the gasket 46 functioning as a seal between the adapter needle 38 and the sealed food grade paper container 10 . The gasket 46 may thus prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 and gasket 46 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 5 A and 5 B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed food grade paper container 10 a placed inside an adapter 30 a with the adapter 30 a placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 5 A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 5 B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4 A and 4 B. FIGS. 5 A and 5 B differ from FIGS. 4 A and 4 B in the features of the sealed food grade paper container 10 a and adapter 30 a . The sealed food grade paper container 10 a may be the same as the sealed food grade paper container 10 except that the exterior shell 16 a of the sealed food grade paper container 10 a includes one or more holes 17 in a lower portion thereof, with the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 . The one or more holes 17 may be used to allow a mixture of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to burst out from the sealed food grade paper container 10 when preparing a serving of coffee. To this end, the adapter 30 a may be the same as the adapter 30 except that the adapter 30 a omits the adapter needle 38 , including, in its place, a borehole 38 a extending from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a to the bottom of the adapter 30 a . The borehole 38 a may be present in the adapter 30 as well, with the only difference being the presence of the adapter needle 38 filling the borehole 38 a in the adapter 30 . As described above, water from the water source 61 may be pressurized by the pump 62 and heated by the heater 64 as it flows through the water conduit 60 . When the heated and pressurized water flows from the water conduit 60 into the sealed food grade paper container 10 a , the added heat and/or pressure of the water shooting into the sealed food grade paper container 10 a and against the bottom of the sealed food grade paper container 10 a may melt or otherwise degrade the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 , allowing the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow out of the sealed food grade paper container 10 a through the one or more holes 17 . Along the same lines, instead of the one or more holes 17 , the exterior shell 16 a may have a kiss cut or other perforation or weakening in the lower portion thereof (preferably bottom exterior side), in the shape of a starburst for example. In this case, the pressure of the water shooting into the sealed food grade paper container 10 a may blow out the exterior shell 16 a itself, rather than only the interior coating 18 . In either case, the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may then flow through the borehole 38 a of the adapter 30 a and down into the person's coffee cup. It should be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to burst through the interior coating 18 and/or exterior shell 16 a of the sealed food grade paper container 10 a should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . In the case of the sealed food grade paper container 10 a and adapter 30 a , there is no adapter needle 38 that punctures the bottom of the sealed food grade paper container 10 a . Therefore, there is no danger of premature puncturing by the adapter needle 38 , and the sealed food grade paper container 10 a may be completely inserted into the adapter 30 a at an initial stage as shown in FIG. 5 A without needing to be pressed farther into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a by the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 . That is, the sealed food grade paper container 10 a may always come to rest with the protruding cap 14 against the top of the adapter 30 a (preventing the sealed food grade paper container 10 a from falling too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a ) as shown in FIG. 5 A, never in an elevated position resting on the adapter needle 38 as in the case of the sealed food grade paper container 10 and adapter 30 as shown in FIG. 4 A. FIGS. 6 A and 6 B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed food grade paper container 10 b placed inside an adapter 30 b with the adapter 30 b placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 6 A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 6 B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4 A and 4 B. FIGS. 6 A and 6 B differ from FIGS. 4 A and 4 B in the features of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b and adapter 30 b . The sealed food grade paper container 10 b may be the same as the sealed food grade paper container 10 except that, unlike the body 12 of the sealed food grade paper container 10 , the body 12 b of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b has a rounded bottom 13 b . In other respects, the body 12 b may be the same as the body 12 and may be, for example, generally cylindrical like the body 12 . The rounded bottom 13 b may advantageously act as a funnel within the sealed food grade paper container 10 b , aiding the flow of all of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water contained in the sealed food grade paper container 10 b to the same part of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b for efficient flow out of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b . For example, if the adapter needle 38 is positioned to puncture the center of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b , the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b to a point at the center of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b where a hole is punctured by the adapter needle 38 . Similarly, in a case where there is no adapter needle 38 and the sealed food grade paper container 10 b has holes 17 or other burst-through mechanism like the sealed food grade paper container 10 a of FIGS. 5 A and 5 B, the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b to the vicinity of the one or more holes 17 or other mechanism. The rounded bottom 13 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b , e.g., as it may be produced from a single sheet of material. The rounded bottom 13 b may be half-spherical or exhibit any other curvature. The rounded bottom 13 b may include portions that are not curved, such as a central flat portion allowing the sealed food grade paper container 10 b to be placed upright without falling over. The sealed food grade paper container 10 b may also differ from the sealed food grade paper container 10 in that the sealed food grade paper container 10 b may have a protruding film 14 b in place of the protruding cap 14 . The protruding film 14 b may be made of an easily puncturable material such as aluminum foil or a laminate of aluminum foil and paper or plastic, which may cause the entrance needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to degrade less quickly as it is repeatedly used to pierce sealed food grade paper containers 10 b . The protruding film 14 b may obviate the need for the interior coating 18 to extend beyond the body 12 b (e.g. to the protruding cap 14 described above), as the protruding film 14 b itself may be made of a material that is resistant to degradation caused by the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The protruding film 14 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b , e.g. as the protruding film 14 b may be produced as a single sheet and without folded portions. The adapter 30 b may be the same as the adapter 30 or the adapter 30 a . The adapter 30 b shown in FIGS. 6 A and 6 B differs from the adapter 30 and 30 a to illustrate some modifications in design that may be applied to any of the adapters 30 , 30 a , 30 b . For example, the adapter 30 b has an annular depression 31 around the recess 32 in place of a sloping region of the adapters 30 and 30 a . The depression 31 is especially useful in the case of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b because the protruding film 14 b may have much less height than the protruding cap 14 . Without the depression 31 , it might be difficult to retrieve the sealed food grade paper container 10 b from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 b after use, since the protruding film 14 b might be almost flush against the top of the adapter 30 b . The depression 31 provides a place for a person's finger to go when grabbing the sealed food grade paper container 10 b , making retrieval of the sealed food grade paper container 10 b from the adapter 30 b easier. The adapter 30 b also illustrates an example in which the overall reduced height of the adapter 30 b relative to the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 , rather than the exterior contour of the adapter 30 b having a sloped or stepped region 34 , may be used to avoid the exit needle 55 of the coffee maker 50 . FIGS. 7 A and 7 B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed food grade paper container 10 c placed inside an adapter 30 c with the adapter 30 c placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 7 A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 7 B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4 A and 4 B. FIGS. 7 A and 7 B differ from FIGS. 4 A and 4 B in the features of the sealed food grade paper container 10 c and adapter 30 c . The sealed food grade paper container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be the same as the sealed food grade paper container 10 and adapter 30 a except that, as shown in FIGS. 7 A and 7 B, the sealed food grade paper container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be shaped to take advantage of the existing exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 . As such, rather than having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as described in relation to FIGS. 4 A and 4 B, the exterior contour of the adapter 30 c may remain wide enough in the vicinity of the exit needle 55 so as to allow the exit needle 55 to extend into a borehole 38 c of the adapter 30 c . In this regard, the borehole 38 c may be structurally the same as the borehole 38 a described in relation to FIGS. 5 A and 5 B, with the difference being its positioning in relation to the exit needle 55 . With the borehole 38 c positioned to correspond to the exit needle 55 , which is off-center, the recess 32 c may similarly be provided off-center in the adapter 30 c . More particularly, the recess 32 c may have a shape that is off-center toward the bottom while being centered in the adapter 30 c toward the top. As shown in FIGS. 7 A and 7 B, for example, the recess 32 c may have a generally upside-down L-shaped profile that diminishes in cross-sectional area from the top to the bottom of the adapter 30 c . By providing such an adapter 30 c , a correspondingly shaped sealed food grade paper container 10 c may be placed in the recess 32 c such that the top of the sealed food grade paper container 10 c may be punctured by a central entrance needle 66 and the bottom of the sealed food grade paper container 10 c may be punctured by an off-center exit needle 55 . In this way, both the needles 66 , 55 of the existing coffee maker 50 may be used and the adapter needle 38 is not required. Heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed food grade paper container 10 c through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container 10 c through the exit needle 55 and down into the person's coffee cup. More specifically, the exit needle 55 may have an internal passage 70 with an inlet 72 near the point of the exit needle 55 where the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed food grade paper container 10 c and an outlet 74 that feeds into the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 . When the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed food grade paper container 10 c , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 72 , through the internal passage 70 , and out of the outlet 74 . Just below the inlet 72 , a gasket 76 may be provided to function as a seal around the exit needle 55 in the same way that the gasket 46 may function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 8 A and 8 B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 d including cross-sectional views of the sealed food grade paper container 10 of FIGS. 1 - 4 B placed inside the coffee maker 50 d without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 8 A showing the coffee maker 50 d in an open position and FIG. 8 B showing the coffee maker 50 d in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 d may differ from the coffee maker 50 described above in that the coffee maker 50 d may be specifically designed for use with the sealed food grade paper container 10 , i.e. with no adapter 30 necessary. In this regard, the coffee maker 50 d may be the same as the coffee maker 50 in all respects except for the recess 52 . Whereas the recess 52 includes an exit needle part 54 with an off-center exit needle 55 , the recess 52 d of FIGS. 8 A and 8 B includes an exit needle part 54 d with an exit needle 55 d that is located in the center. The recess 52 d may further include a funnel part 56 d that is the same as the funnel part 56 except that it is designed to align with the centered exit needle 55 d of the exit needle part 54 d rather than the off-center exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . The recess 52 d may further differ from the recess 52 in that it may have a generally smaller interior than the recess 52 of an existing coffee maker 50 (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker). This is because, as described above, the sealed food grade paper container 10 may be significantly smaller than a single-serve ground coffee container like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod. In use, heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed food grade paper container 10 through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed food grade paper container 10 through the exit needle 55 d and down into the person's coffee cup. Alternatively, the coffee maker 50 d may omit the exit needle 55 d , having only a borehole similar to the borehole 38 a but extending downward from the recess 52 d of the coffee maker 55 d rather than from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a . Such a modified coffee maker 55 d could be used with the sealed food grade paper container 10 a having the one or more holes 17 . The combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may burst from the sealed food grade paper container 10 as the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 melts (or as the sealed food grade paper container 10 itself bursts open as described above), thereafter flowing down through the borehole 38 a and into the person's coffee cup. In the example of the dedicated coffee maker 50 d of FIGS. 8 A and 8 B, a funnel part 56 d is included, corresponding to the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4 A- 7 B. The funnel part 56 of FIGS. 4 A- 7 B is a feature some existing coffee makers (e.g. Keurig® coffee makers) and therefore is depicted in FIGS. 4 A- 7 B, which may represent embodiments in the context of existing coffee makers. On the other hand, the coffee maker 50 d shown in FIGS. 8 A and 8 B represents a coffee maker 50 d that is designed for use with the sealed food grade paper containers 10 , 10 a , etc. of the present disclosure. Thus, the funnel part 56 d can be omitted. FIGS. 9 A and 9 B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4 A- 7 B, including cross-sectional views of a food grade paper container 10 e placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 9 A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 9 B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The food grade paper container 10 e may be a reusable container rather than a disposable container and may differ from the food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above in several respects. First, the food grade paper container 10 e may have an open or openable top 78 in place of a sealing cap 14 or film 14 b . As shown in FIGS. 9 A and 9 B, for example, the top 78 of the food grade paper container 10 e may contain a central opening 80 , but it is also contemplated that the top 78 may be openable, e.g. by a hinge. Second, the food grade paper container 10 e may have a pressure relief valve 82 at the bottom. The pressure relief valve 82 , illustrated schematically in FIGS. 9 A and 9 B, may be of any known construction that is capable of opening in response to a buildup of pressure in the food grade paper container 10 e or in the bottom region thereof. In a simple construction, the pressure relief valve 82 may be a flap or door that is biased in a closed position to seal against the food grade paper container 10 e and opens downward when pushed from above. Third, the overall size and shape of the food grade paper container 10 e may be somewhat larger than that of the food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above and may, for example, be shaped and sized similarly to a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or other single-serve ground coffee container and designed to fit directly in an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 similar to how the adapter 30 fits in the exit needle part 54 in FIGS. 4 A and 4 B. For example, an outwardly extending lip 84 of the food grade paper container 10 e may function just like the lip 36 to allow the food grade paper container 10 e to rest on the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 without falling in or touching the needle 55 . Since the food grade paper container 10 e may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the food grade paper container 10 e , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the food grade paper container 10 e through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then place the food grade paper container 10 e inside the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9 A and lower the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9 B. Heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the food grade paper container 10 e through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the food grade paper container 10 e through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. In this regard, the valve 82 may be configured to remain closed under the pressure of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 (i.e. after dispensing liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the reusable food grade paper container 10 D) and to open under the pressure of the flow of water from the water conduit 60 . It should also be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to open the pressure relief valve 82 should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . When the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the food grade paper container 10 e , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the food grade paper container 10 e as the water flows through the reusable food grade paper container 10 e . Thus, one may immediately reuse the food grade paper container 10 e. FIGS. 10 A and 10 B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4 A- 7 B, 9 A, and 9 B, including cross-sectional views of another food grade paper container 10 f placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 10 A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 10 B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The food grade paper container 10 f may be the same as the food grade paper container 10 e and may similarly be reusable, except that the food grade paper container 10 f may be shaped and sized similarly to an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . Thus, in a case where the coffee maker 50 is a Keurig® coffee maker, an example of the shape and size of the food grade paper container 10 f is the My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter by Keurig®. Like the food grade paper container 10 e , since the food grade paper container 10 f may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the food grade paper container 10 f , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the food grade paper container 10 f through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then replace the exit needle part 54 and funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 with the food grade paper container 10 f as shown in FIGS. 9 A and 9 B (e.g. in the case of a Kuerig® coffee maker 50 , the Keurig® portion pack holder may be pushed up from below and removed, and the food grade paper container 10 f may be placed in the resulting recess just like a My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter). With the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 lowered as shown in FIG. 10 B, heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the food grade paper container 10 f through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the food grade paper container 10 f through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. As in the case of the food grade paper container 10 e , when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the food grade paper container 10 f , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the food grade paper container 10 f as the water flows through the reusable food grade paper container 10 f. In the above examples, water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 (and combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 ) are described as flowing through hollow needles 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . However, it is also contemplated that the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may instead only pierce the sealed food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. without additionally functioning as a conduit for the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 . For example, the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may retract subsequent to puncturing the sealed food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. or be structured to allow the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow adjacent to or around the outside of the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . In the above examples, the top and bottom of the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 enters or exits the sealed food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. through the top or bottom of the sealed food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. Other points of entry or exit are also contemplated, such as the side. In the above examples, generally cylindrical shapes are depicted for the sealed food grade paper container 10 , 10 a , etc. However, other shapes are contemplated as well, such as balls, boxes, etc., and it is contemplated that adapters 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to accommodate such shapes. It is similarly envisioned that the exterior of the adapter 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to fit inside any single-serve coffee maker, e.g. coffee makers by Keurig®, Nespresso®, Mr. Coffee®, Cuisinart®, Presto® MyJo™, Bunn®, etc., and may be designed to fit universally inside more than one coffee maker. The present disclosure further encompasses various embodiments of systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a formed (e.g. molded or otherwise given some shape on a scale larger than a particle or granule) soluble coffee product. A person wishing to make a single serving of coffee takes a food grade paper container 110 and places it in a coffee maker 200 . Before or after placing the food grade paper container 110 in the coffee maker 200 , the person may place one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 in the food grade paper container 110 , optionally along with one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products (throughout this disclosure, descriptions/drawings of formed soluble coffee products 120 may also describe/represent formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products). Unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules, the person may thus mix and match coffees, flavors, etc. to suit his/her taste and desired coffee strength. The person may then close the food grade paper container 110 with a cap 118 having an orifice 119 . The coffee maker 200 may be a Keurig®, Nespresso®, or other coffee maker that is designed to be used with single-serve ground coffee containers. The person then closes the lid 230 of the coffee maker 50 down on the food grade paper container 110 , causing a needle 220 of the coffee maker 200 to enter the orifice 119 of the cap 118 and allowing heated water to flow into the food grade paper container 110 through the orifice 119 . The heated water may flow against, around, and between the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 and any additive products in the food grade paper container 110 , and the combined soluble coffee etc. and heated water may flow out of the food grade paper container 110 through holes 114 and into the person's coffee cup. As in the case of the food grade paper containers 10 e and 10 f , when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the food grade paper container 110 , as the heated water from the coffee maker 200 may sufficiently clean the inside of the food grade paper container 110 as the water flows through the food grade paper container 110 . Afterward, the food grade paper container 110 may immediately be reused and need not be taken out of the coffee maker 200 . Unlike using Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules, using the food grade paper container 110 produces no waste. FIGS. 11 A, 11 B, 11 C are a perspective view, a side view, and a top view, respectively, of a food grade paper container 110 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The food grade paper container 110 may be filled with one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 (see FIGS. 13 B, 14 A, 14 B, and 15 ) and closed with a cap 118 (see FIGS. 12 A, 12 B, 13 C, 14 A, and 14 B), with each formed soluble coffee product 120 containing an amount of soluble coffee for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, e.g. 1 teaspoon of soluble coffee. The food grade paper container 110 may have a generally cylindrical body 112 as shown with one or more stoppers 116 that extend laterally outward from the food grade paper container 110 in an upper portion thereof relative to the body 112 (e.g. by 2-10 mm). When the food grade paper container 110 is inserted into the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 (see FIG. 13 A), the body 112 of the food grade paper container 110 may fit inside the recess 210 while the stoppers 116 do not fit inside the recess 210 . In this way, the stoppers 116 may prevent the food grade paper container 110 from being inserted too far into the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 and may provide a convenient handhold for a person removing the food grade paper container 110 from the coffee maker 200 . The stoppers 116 may be a separate piece as shown in FIGS. 11 A and 11 C (e.g. attached by adhesive or a rivet or other fastener) or may be integrally formed with the body 112 of the food grade paper container 110 (see FIGS. 14 A and 14 B). Like the sealed food grade paper container 10 described above, the food grade paper container 110 may be made of a recyclable or biodegradable material or combination of materials (and may be made by the same manufacturing methods). However, since the food grade paper container 110 may be reusable and the moldable soluble coffee product is completely dissolved after the coffee is made, no trash is generated when using the soluble coffee product. Therefore, the food grade paper container 110 may alternatively be made of a material that is not recyclable or biodegradable, such as plastics including non-recyclable plastics. For example, the body 112 (including stopper 116 ) and cap 118 of the food grade paper container 110 may be made of a hard plastic such as polypropylene and may be manufactured by injection molding. The overall capacity of the food grade paper container 110 may be great enough to contain one or more of the formed soluble coffee products 120 and/or formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products. Depending on the coffee maker 200 that the food grade paper container 110 is to be used with, multiple size settings may be available for dispensing different amounts of heated water (e.g. small, medium, and large). In some cases, a user of the food grade paper container 110 may want a large cup of coffee without sacrificing coffee strength and may therefore desire to place more formed soluble coffee products 120 in the food grade paper container 110 when using larger size settings. The user may further wish to add formed soluble flavor and/or creamer additive products to suit his/her taste. Due to the absence of a filter in the food grade paper container 110 (unlike a Keurig® K-Cup® pod) and the concentrated nature of soluble coffee, the food grade paper container 110 can be relatively large compared to the size of an individual formed soluble coffee product 120 while the formed soluble coffee product 120 is still large enough to contain an amount suitable for a single cup of coffee. In this way, the food grade paper container 110 may be sized to fit three, four, five, six, or more formed soluble coffee products 120 and/or formed soluble additive products. The capacity of the food grade paper container 110 may range from a minimum capacity needed to contain a single formed soluble coffee product 120 (e.g. 5 mL, but may be lower depending on the concentration of the formed soluble coffee product 120 and the desired strength of the coffee) up to a maximum capacity depending on the size of the coffee maker that the food grade paper container 110 will be used with. For example, if the food grade paper container 110 will be inserted in a Keurig® coffee maker, a relatively large food grade paper container 110 may have a capacity of around 40 mL. In the interest of maximizing the size of the food grade paper container 110 to allow for multiple formed soluble coffee products 120 and additive products, the capacity of the food grade paper container 110 may be greater than 20 mL, preferably greater than 25 mL, more preferably greater than 30 mL. Accounting for the material(s) of the food grade paper container 110 itself, the food grade paper container 110 may have an exterior volume that is slightly greater than its capacity, where the exterior volume is defined as the total volume of liquid displaced when the food grade paper container 110 is submerged in the liquid. Such exterior volume may similarly range between low values around 5 mL and relatively high values around 40 mL, with the exterior volume greater than the capacity of the food grade paper container 110 by an amount defined by the volume displaced by the material(s) of the food grade paper container 110 . The exterior of the food grade paper container 110 may be shaped to fit inside an existing coffee maker 200 in the same way that a single-serve ground coffee container fits inside the coffee maker 200 . Thus, for example, the exterior of the food grade paper container 110 may be shaped like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod, a Nespresso® capsule, etc., depending on which existing coffee maker 200 the food grade paper container 110 is designed for. It is also contemplated that the food grade paper container 110 may be designed to universally match two or more such existing coffee makers (e.g. by matching a height dimension of one and a width dimension of another). In some cases, an existing coffee maker 200 may have a needle 215 (see FIGS. 14 A and 14 B) positioned to pierce a lower portion of a single-serve ground coffee container. For example, a Keurig® coffee maker may have a part known as a K-Cup® holder that functions as a recess 210 for receiving a K-Cup® pod, and the K-Cup® holder may have a part known as an exit needle 215 that is positioned to pierce the bottom of the K-Cup® pod at a peripheral region of the K-Cup® pod. The food grade paper container 110 may be shaped so as to avoid touching or pressing hard against such needle 215 as shown in FIGS. 14 A and 14 B. In this regard, the food grade paper container 110 may have a reduced height relative to the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 , so as not to extend deeply enough into the recess to reach the needle 215 , or the food grade paper container 110 may have an exterior contour with a sloped or stepped region 113 (see FIG. 11 B) in a lower portion thereof that slopes or steps inward to avoid the needle 215 . The outer diameter at the bottom of the food grade paper container 110 may be about 70-95% of the outer diameter at the top of the food grade paper container 110 (excluding the stoppers 116 ), more preferably 80-90%. For example, the outer diameter at the bottom of the food grade paper container 110 may be around 3.5-4.0 cm while the outer diameter at the top of the food grade paper container 110 is around 4.0-4.5 cm. In addition to helping to avoid the needle 215 , such reduced diameter at the bottom of the food grade paper container 110 may make it easier to insert the food grade paper container 110 into the coffee maker 200 . Such reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 113 may symmetrically define the exterior of the food grade paper container 110 or may occur only in a portion of the food grade paper container 110 , e.g. as a dedicated slot to receive the needle 215 . In combination with the stoppers 116 described above, the reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 113 may prevent the food grade paper container 110 from being inserted too far into the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 and may allow the food grade paper container 110 to avoid the needle 215 . As shown in FIGS. 11 A, 11 C, 13 A, 14 A, and 14 B, the food grade paper container 110 may have one or more holes 114 in a lower portion (e.g. a lower half, quarter, etc.) thereof. The one or more holes 114 may be used to allow a mixture of soluble coffee and heated water to flow out from the food grade paper container 110 as the heated water dissolves the formed soluble coffee product 120 . Because the formed soluble coffee product 120 should remain inside the food grade paper container 110 until it is dissolved, the one or more holes 114 are sized to prevent the formed soluble coffee product 120 from passing therethrough when the formed soluble coffee product 120 is placed in the food grade paper container 110 . The size (e.g. diameter) of each hole 114 may be, for example, 0.5 to 5 millimeters, preferably 1 to three millimeters, more preferably 1.5 to 2.5 millimeters. If the one or more holes 114 are too small, the flow of dissolved coffee and heated water out of the food grade paper container 110 will be prevented or slowed. The number of holes 114 may range upward from 1 hole, with a greater number of holes used in the case of smaller holes and with fewer holes used in the case of larger holes. For example, in the case of 2 mm diameter holes, there may be 4 to 14 holes, more preferably 8 to 10 holes. In order to avoid pooling of liquid against the wall of the food grade paper container 110 , the distance D (see FIG. 11 A) between one or more of the holes 114 and the wall of the food grade paper container 110 may be under 10 mm, preferably under 5 mm, and may be equal to 0 (i.e. one or more of the holes 114 are located at the wall). As shown in FIGS. 12 A and 12 B, the cap 118 may have a circular shape to fit on a cylindrical food grade paper container 110 , with an orifice 119 in the middle thereof. The cap 118 may have a stepped structure in which only a reduced-diameter lower part of the cap 118 fits within the interior of the food grade paper container 110 to produce a snug fit between the food grade paper container 110 and the cap 118 . It is also contemplated that the cap 118 may be attached to the food grade paper container 110 by a hinge. FIGS. 13 A, 13 B, and 13 C are perspective views of a coffee maker 200 with the food grade paper container 110 placed in a recess 210 thereof. In a case where the coffee maker 200 is a Keurig® coffee maker, the recess 210 may be a K-Cup® holder (which itself may be removable). As shown in FIG. 13 A, the food grade paper container 110 may be placed in the recess 210 with the stoppers 116 positioned within grooves 212 of the recess 210 . In this regard, the stoppers 116 may be disposed on the food grade paper container 110 so as to align with the grooves 212 and may be, for example, a pair of coaxially arranged stoppers 116 . The shape of each stopper 116 may conform to the shape of each groove 212 . For example, in the case of a curved groove 212 , the bottom surface of each stopper 116 may be curved to match the curve of the groove 212 (e.g. with the same or smaller radius curvature). The stoppers 116 may, for example, be cylindrical. Matching the shape of the stoppers 116 to the shape of the grooves 212 may allow for a snug fit to help ensure that the food grade paper container 110 does not abut too far out of the recess 210 so that the lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 can open and close completely. The reduced height of the food grade paper container 110 and/or sloped or stepped region 113 may be designed to prevent the food grade paper container 110 from touching or pressing hard against an exit needle (not shown) of the coffee maker 220 while the stoppers 116 are positioned within the grooves 212 . FIG. 13 B shows the same view as FIG. 13 A, but with one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 placed in the food grade paper container 110 . As can be seen, the formed soluble coffee product 120 visible in FIG. 13 B (a heart-shaped wafer) completely covers the holes 114 of the food grade paper container 110 . In this respect, the formed soluble coffee products 120 may have a dimension (e.g. a bottom surface in the case of a wafer shape) that completely covers the one or more holes 114 when placed in the food grade paper container 110 . As described below in more detail this may improve the efficiency of the process of dissolving the formed soluble coffee products 120 , ensuring that no waste is produced and that the food grade paper container 110 comes out clean when the process is over. FIG. 13 C shows the same view as FIGS. 13 A and 13 B, but with the cap 118 placed on the food grade paper container 110 . The orifice 119 of the cap 118 may be positioned such that an entrance needle 220 in a lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 aligns with the orifice 119 and enters the orifice 119 as the lid 230 is moved from an open position (see FIG. 14 A) to a closed position (see FIG. 14 B). FIGS. 14 A and 14 B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 200 including cross-sectional views of the food grade paper container 110 placed inside the coffee maker 200 , with FIG. 14 A showing the coffee maker 200 in an open position and FIG. 14 B showing the coffee maker 200 in a closed position. As shown, the food grade paper container 110 is shaped and sized to fit directly in the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 with the one or more stoppers 116 preventing the food grade paper container 110 from falling into the recess 210 . The illustrated recess 210 is a K-Cup® holder as used in Keurig® coffee makers, including an exit needle part 214 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) and a funnel part 216 . As can be seen, the food grade paper container 110 is positioned in the recess 210 so as to avoid an exit needle 215 of the exit needle part 214 . In the example of FIGS. 14 A and 14 B, the full height of the food grade paper container 110 is short enough to prevent the food grade paper container 110 from touching (or at least prevent the food grade paper container 110 from pressing hard against) the needle 215 while the one or more stoppers 116 rests within grooves 212 of the recess 210 (see FIG. 13 A). As such, damage to the food grade paper container 110 can be avoided. In addition to the recess 210 (having the exit needle part 214 and the funnel part 216 ), the coffee maker 200 shown in FIGS. 14 A and 14 B has a lid 230 (see FIG. 14 B as well as FIGS. 13 A, 13 B, and 13 C), a water conduit 235 , a pump 250 , and a heater 260 . The water conduit 235 provides water for making a cup of coffee. For example, water from a water source 240 may flow through the water conduit 235 and into the food grade paper container 110 as described in more detail below. The water source 240 may be, for example, a fillable water tank of the coffee maker 200 . The pump 250 may pump the water from the water source 240 to the food grade paper container 110 via the water conduit 235 , and the heater 260 may heat the water. For example, the heater 260 may heat the water while the water is at the water source 240 (e.g. in a water tank) or while the water is en route to the food grade paper container 110 (e.g. as the water flows through piping or tubing or one or more heating tanks of the water conduit 235 ). Thus, the heater 260 may heat only the amount of water needed for an individual cup of coffee or may heat a larger batch of water. The heater 260 may be an electric heater that heats the water by Joule heating. As in the case of the coffee maker 50 and related embodiments described above, it is also contemplated that the water source 240 of the coffee maker 200 may be a connection to a cold water line of a building, similar to that used by a refrigerator that has a water dispenser or ice maker. In this case, the pump 250 may be omitted as the pressure in the water line is used to bring the water to the food grade paper container 110 via the water conduit 235 . The lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 may have an entrance needle 220 that is inserted into the orifice 119 of the cap 118 when the coffee maker 200 is in the closed position as shown in FIG. 14 B. In the case of an existing coffee maker 200 (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker), the entrance needle 220 may typically be used for piercing a hole in the top of a K-Cup® pod when the lid 230 is pressed down onto the K-Cup® pod. To this end, the entrance needle 220 may have a sharp point at the bottom. The entrance needle 220 may also be hollow and act as a part of the water conduit 235 (e.g. with an upper end of the entrance needle 220 connected to tubing or piping of the water conduit 235 ). As the lid 230 is pressed down onto the food grade paper container 110 , a bottom face of the lid 230 may abut against the food grade paper container 110 and the entrance needle 220 may enter the orifice 119 . In this way, the water from the water source 240 may flow through the water conduit 235 and into the food grade paper container 110 through the tip of the entrance needle 220 . When a person wishes to use the food grade paper container 110 to make a cup of coffee, he/she may place one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 into the food grade paper container 110 , along with any desired formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products, and place the cap 118 on the food grade paper container 110 . The person may then place the food grade paper container 110 inside the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 as shown in FIG. 14 A and lower the lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 as shown in FIG. 14 B. Heated water may then flow from the water conduit 235 into the food grade paper container 110 through the entrance needle 220 , which may work to dissolve the contents of the food grade paper container 110 (e.g. soluble coffee, flavor, etc.), and the combined heated water and dissolved soluble coffee (along with any dissolved additives) may flow out of the food grade paper container 110 through the one or more holes 114 and down into the person's coffee cup. The entire process may produce no waste. Moreover, when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the food grade paper container 110 , as the heated water from the coffee maker 200 may sufficiently clean the inside of the food grade paper container 110 as the water flows through the food grade paper container 110 . For example, the coffee making process may have a first part where the heated water dissolves all of the soluble coffee (along with any soluble additives) and a second part where the heated water continues to flow through the food grade paper container 110 to rinse out and disinfect the food grade paper container 110 . During the second part of the coffee making process, any remaining coffee that remains between or around the holes 114 may be forced out of the food grade paper container 110 by the flow of water. Thus, one may immediately reuse the food grade paper container 110 . For example, in a case where the entire coffee making process involves flowing twelve ounces of water through the food grade paper container 110 , the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 and food grade paper container 110 may be designed such that the first 3-11 ounces (preferably 9-11 ounces, e.g. 10 ounces) of water completely dissolve the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 while the final 1-9 ounces (preferably 1-3 ounces, e.g. 2 ounces) of water rinse the food grade paper container 110 . As shown in FIGS. 14 A and 14 B, a plurality of formed soluble coffee products 120 and soluble flavor or creamer additive products may be placed in the food grade paper container 110 . In the example of FIGS. 14 A and 14 B, any of the three formed soluble coffee products 120 may be a formed soluble flavor or creamer additive product, which may be used in the same way and may be structurally the same. Specifically, three formed soluble coffee products 120 and/or additive products (hereinafter formed soluble coffee products 120 ) are shown in a stacked arrangement. When preparing a desired combination of contents for his/her cup of coffee, a user may simply stack additional formed soluble coffee products 120 one on top of the other. As shown, the formed soluble coffee products 120 completely cover the holes 114 . As a result, water in a peripheral region within the food grade paper container 110 between the formed soluble coffee products 120 and the wall of the food grade paper container 110 (which has in most cases already flowed against the formed soluble coffee products 120 to reach the peripheral region of the food grade paper container 110 ) may flow against the underside of the formed soluble coffee products 12 as it passes from the peripheral region of the food grade paper container 110 to the holes 114 . This may result in an efficient dissolving process as the amount of times the water flows against the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be maximized. This may help ensure that no waste is produced and that the food grade paper container 110 is clean when the process ends. The efficiency of the dissolving process may be further improved by the existence of gaps 123 a , 123 b around the sides of as well as between the stacked formed soluble coffee products 120 , which allow water to flow down, around, and between the stacked formed soluble coffee products 120 to maximize the surface area across which the hot water contacts and the dissolving process takes place. Such gaps 123 a around the sides of the formed soluble coffee products 120 are due to the relative size of the formed soluble coffee products 120 and the food grade paper container 110 , which may be selected accordingly. In order for there to be gaps 123 b between the formed soluble coffee products 120 , each of the formed soluble coffee products 120 may have one or more protrusions 122 (e.g. on bottoms thereof) to produce a gap 123 b between adjacent formed soluble coffee products 120 . As can be seen, such protrusions 122 may act as spacers to prevent the formed soluble coffee products 120 from lying flush against each other while stacked, thus allowing for water to pass through the gap 123 b between the formed soluble coffee products 120 . By maximizing the surface area for dissolving in these ways, the efficiency of the dissolving process may be improved. This may help ensure that no waste is produced and that the food grade paper container 110 is clean when the process ends. FIG. 15 is a side view of a single formed soluble coffee product 120 (which may also serve as an illustration of a formed soluble flavor or creamer additive product). The formed soluble coffee product 120 may be made by a process of temperature reduction, solidification and dehydration or a spray-drying process. For example, coffee (e.g. brewed coffee or liquid coffee concentrate, which may itself be produced by dehydrating brewed coffee) may be poured into a mold (e.g. a silicon mold, which may withstand cold temperature (e.g., between −50° F. and −32° F., and more particularly as low as −20° F.), and optionally a flavor or creamer additive may be poured into the mold together with the coffee. In this regard, manufacturing the formed soluble coffee product 120 may optionally begin with one or more preliminary steps such as brewing the coffee, dehydrating the coffee to produce a liquid coffee concentrate, grinding roasted coffee beans to produce coffee grounds for brewing, and roasting the coffee beans. The mold may have a desired shape, e.g. a wafer, a ball, or any other shape, including “fun” shapes such as stars, hearts, animals, etc. The coffee and optional additive may then be thermally reduced (e.g. at −20° F. under pressure for 24 hours), solidified and dehydrated while in the mold to produce the formed soluble coffee product 120 . Alternatively, or additionally, ultrasonic energy may be applied to the contents of the mold (e.g. having a frequency between 20 Khz to 35 Khz and more preferably between 27 Khz to 33 Khz). The ultrasonic energy may fuse the contents of the mold to produce the formed soluble coffee product 120 . As another alternative to thermally reducing, solidifying and dehydrating or ultrasonic energy, or in addition, a water-soluble binder (e.g. sodium bicarbonate, stearic acid, and/or magnesium stearate) may be added to the mold together with the coffee and optional additive. A press may compress the contents of the mold including the binder to form the formed soluble coffee product 120 . It is also contemplated that, in some cases, powdered or granulated soluble coffee, e.g. already thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated soluble coffee, rather than brewed coffee or liquid coffee concentrate, may be placed in the mold to be pressed into the formed soluble coffee product 120 . In the above process, the process of thermally reducing, solidifying and dehydrating may be performed in two stages: a pre-freeze stage and a refreeze stage. In the pre-freeze stage, the coffee and optional additive may be frozen in the mold (e.g. at −20° F. In the refreeze stage, the pre-frozen product may be popped out of the mold and allowed to continue the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration outside of the mold (e.g. on a tray). Letting the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration occur outside of the mold allows the product to breathe and helps remove all of the remaining moisture, which might otherwise be trapped in on by the mold. In addition to one or more protrusions 122 as described above (which may be formed by the shape of the mold), the formed soluble coffee product 120 may have a dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 . The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may be an edible liquid cellulose coating that protects the formed soluble coffee product 120 from breaking apart while it is handled. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may dissolve in water. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may also prevent moisture from entering the formed soluble coffee product 120 . The formed soluble coffee product 120 may be packaged in the dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 after the formed soluble coffee product 120 is manufactured. For example, the newly manufactured formed soluble coffee product 120 may be wrapped in or otherwise surrounded by a sheet of the coating/wrapper material on two or more sides, and the ends of the sheet(s) may then be fused together by the application of heat to create a sealed dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 . Alternatively, the dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may be a cellulose spray that is sprayed onto the newly manufactured formed soluble coffee product 120 after the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration described above. In lieu of cellulose, the material may be pullulan, pectin, starch, polyvinyl acetate, sodium alginate or combinations and a combination with cellulose with any one of the listed materials. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may have a thickness of 0.001 inches to 0.010 inches. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may be sufficiently thin to dissolve fast enough so that hot water dissolves through the dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 and the formed soluble coffee product 120 during the first part of the first part of the coffee making process (i.e. prior to the second part in which the food grade paper container 110 is rinsed with the remaining water). It is also contemplated that a user may dip a formed soluble coffee product 120 in a dissolvable coating 124 such as a flavor or creamer additive (e.g. powder, liquid) prior to placing the formed soluble coffee product 120 in the food grade paper container 110 . Such a dissolvable coating 124 may be separately packaged in a container with a suitably sized opening for dipping or with other dispensing means (e.g. a squeeze or pump bottle). The size of the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be predetermined to correspond to a single cup of coffee. Alternatively, the size of the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be predetermined to correspond to less than a single cup of coffee, e.g. a half a cup of coffee or a third of a cup of coffee, in order to encourage mixing and matching of formed soluble coffee products 120 . For example, in some cases, a single cup of coffee of a single type (e.g. flavor, decaf) may be made using three of the same type of formed soluble coffee product 120 , while a single cup of coffee of a mixed type may be made using two formed soluble coffee products 120 of one type and one formed soluble coffee products 120 of another. The size as well as the shape (e.g. surface area) of the formed soluble coffee product 120 may further be predetermined to correspond to an amount of heated water associated with the coffee maker 200 . In this way, it can be ensured that the amount of heated water dispensed by the coffee maker 200 is enough to dissolve the formed soluble coffee product 120 completely, preferably with some additional heated water left over to rinse any remaining residue from the food grade paper container 110 and ensure that no waste is produced. For example, as noted above, a given coffee maker 200 may have multiple size settings for dispensing different amounts of heated water (e.g. small, medium, and large). The formed soluble coffee product 120 may be sized and shaped such that a single formed soluble coffee product 120 is dissolved completely (with some leftover water) by the “small” size setting. FIG. 16 is a side view of a food grade paper container 110 a , which is a variant of the food grade paper container 110 shown in FIGS. 11 A, 11 B, and 11 C. As described above, one or more holes 114 may be provided in a lower portion of the food grade paper container 110 in order to allow the combined soluble coffee and heated water to pass through the food grade paper container 110 and into a user's cup. In this regard, the placement of the holes 114 is not limited to the bottom of the food grade paper container 110 as shown in FIGS. 11 A and 11 C. For example, as shown in FIG. 16 , a food grade paper container 110 a may be provided that is the same as the food grade paper container 110 except that holes 114 a are provided on the side walls of the food grade paper container 110 a instead of holes 114 provided on the bottom (or in addition to holes 114 provided on the bottom). Placing the holes 114 a on the side walls and not on the bottom may help prevent residue from the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 from escaping out the bottom of the food grade paper container 110 a prior to the dissolving process (e.g. as the user handles the food grade paper container 110 a ). In a case where the holes 114 a are provided on the side walls of the food grade paper container 110 a and not on the bottom, it is contemplated that the bottom of the food grade paper container 110 a may be sloped in the direction of the holes to aid in removal of the combined soluble coffee and heated water during use, i.e. to avoid pooling in the bottom of the food grade paper container 110 . FIG. 17 is a cross-sectional view of a food grade paper container 110 b , which is another variant of the food grade paper container 110 shown in FIGS. 11 A, 11 B, and 11 C. The food grade paper container 110 b may be the same as the food grade paper container 110 except that the food grade paper container 110 b may be designed to receive multiple predetermined sizes and/or shapes of formed soluble coffee products 120 (e.g. corresponding to desired strengths and/or coffee maker size settings). To this end, the interior of the food grade paper container 110 b may have two or more nested receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 . In the example of FIG. 17 , the receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 are contoured to fit spherical (or at least partially spherical) formed soluble coffee products 120 (e.g. coffee balls), with the lower receptacle 115 - 1 sized to fit a small coffee ball and the upper receptacle 115 - 2 designed to fit a large coffee ball. It is contemplated that additional nested receptacles 115 - 3 , 115 - 4 , etc. may be provided as well, possibly fitting three, four, five, six, or more such coffee balls (or formed soluble coffee products 120 of other shapes). Each of the nested receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 may include one or more holes 114 b - 1 , 114 b - 2 , which may be the same as the holes 114 , 114 a described above except that they may be arranged in sets corresponding to the receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 as shown. In the example of FIG. 17 , the set of holes 114 b - 2 corresponding to the upper receptacle 115 - 2 (for the large coffee ball) provides passage of the combined heated water and soluble coffee for some distance before reaching the exterior of the body 112 of the food grade paper container 110 b . To this end, the holes 115 b - 2 may have an elongated geometry to serve as tunnels from the interior to the exterior of the food grade paper container 110 b as shown. In some cases, only a single set of holes 114 b - 1 corresponding to the lowest of the nested receptacles 115 - 1 may be exist. The other holes 114 b - 2 , etc. do not exist. In this way, when the lowest receptacle 115 - 1 is used (e.g. for a small coffee ball), it can be ensured that the heated water does not flow out of any holes 114 b - 2 corresponding to upper receptacles 115 - 2 . Meanwhile, when the upper receptacle 115 - 2 is used (e.g. for a large coffee ball), the water must flow beside and under the coffee balls to dissolve the same. Plus, the lower holes 114 b - 1 may still adequately function to allow the heated water and soluble coffee to flow out of the food grade paper container 110 b. In the figures and description, the nested shapes are shaped to match a spherical ball shape for the dissolvable coffee product. However, other shapes are also contemplated such as pyramidal, football, egg shaped for the dissolvable coffee product and the nested shapes. It is noted that a coffee ball shape for the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be advantageous in that, owing to its spherical shape, it may roll against the interior of the food grade paper container 110 b to auto-locate at the correct receptacle 115 without getting stuck in the wrong position or in the wrong orientation (e.g. as a wafer-shaped formed soluble coffee product 120 might get stuck on its end or leaned up against the interior of the food grade paper container 110 ). This may help ensure that the coffee ball covers the holes 114 b , improving the efficiency of the dissolving process as the water must flow against the coffee ball to exit through the holes 114 b. In the above examples, the heated water enters the food grade paper container 110 , 110 a , 110 b through the top of the food grade paper container 110 , 110 a , 110 b . Other points of entry are also contemplated, such as the side. In the above examples, generally cylindrical shapes are depicted for the food grade paper container 110 , 110 a , 110 b . However, other shapes are contemplated as well, such as balls, boxes, etc., and it is contemplated that coffee makers 200 may be designed to accommodate such shapes. It is similarly envisioned that the exterior of the food grade paper container 110 , 110 a , 110 b may be designed to fit inside any single-serve coffee maker, e.g. coffee makers by Keurig®, Nespresso®, Mr. Coffee®, Cuisinart®, Presto® MyJo™, Bunn®, etc., and may be designed to fit universally inside more than one coffee maker. FIG. 18 is a perspective view of a coffee maker 300 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, together with formed soluble coffee products 120 to be used with the coffee maker 300 . FIG. 19 is a schematic view of the coffee maker 300 . Except for differences described below, the coffee maker 300 may be the same as the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a , 110 , 210 (preferably 10 , 10 a ) described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/040,470 (the '470 Application), which is incorporated by reference here in entirety. For example, the coffee maker 300 may include a housing 314 , upper portion 316 , base 320 , serving size selector 326 , froth level control 328 , rotatable knob 332 , horizontal slider 338 , flavor concentrate port 346 , flavor concentrate container 348 , cream concentrate port 350 , cream concentrate container 352 , flavor port valve 354 , cream port valve 355 , tubing or piping 356 , water reservoir 368 with sides 376 and open end 378 , lid 370 with sides 374 , intake 372 , pump 382 , computer 384 , boil chamber 386 , mixing chamber 388 , outlet port valve 392 , and wired 396 or wireless connections that are respectively the same as the housing 14 , upper portion 16 , base 20 , serving size selector 26 , froth level control 28 , rotatable knob 32 , horizontal slider 38 , flavor concentrate port 46 , flavor concentrate container 48 , cream concentrate port 50 , cream concentrate container 52 , flavor port valve 54 , cream port valve 55 , tubing or piping 56 , water reservoir 68 with sides 76 and open end 78 , lid 70 with sides 74 , intake 72 , pump 82 , computer 84 , boil chamber 86 , mixing chamber 88 , outlet port valve 92 , and wired 96 or wireless connections of the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a described in the '470 Application. The coffee maker 300 may further include any of the other features described in relation to the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a of the '470 Application. The coffee maker 300 may differ from the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a in that the coffee concentrate port 42 , coffee concentrate container 44 , and coffee port valve 53 may be replaced with a mouth 317 for receiving one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 (and/or formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products, which may also be referred to as formed soluble coffee products 120 herein) and a lid 315 for covering the mouth 317 . As schematically shown in FIG. 19 , the mouth 317 may provide access to the mixing chamber 388 . The coffee maker 300 may further differ from the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a in the design of the mixing chamber 388 as described in relation to FIGS. 20 and 21 . A person wishing to make a cup of coffee using the coffee maker 300 may simply remove the lid 315 (e.g. the lid 315 may be left covering the mouth 317 to prevent dust from entering the coffee maker 300 while it is not in use), drop one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 into the mixing chamber 388 via the mouth 317 , replace the lid 315 (to prevent splashing and reduce noise during the coffee making process), and initiate the coffee making process using the controls of the coffee maker 300 as described in relation to the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a of the '470 Application. Prior to initiating the coffee making process, the person may optionally add flavor or creamer from the flavor concentrate container 348 and cream concentrate container 352 in the same way as described in the '470 Application in relation to the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a . Water from the water reservoir 368 is heated by the heater 386 and pumped by the pump 382 into the mixing chamber 388 , where it dissolves the formed soluble coffee product 120 and any formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products (the soluble contents of the mixing chamber 388 ) and mixes with any flavor or creamer concentrates dispensed from the flavor concentrate container 348 or cream concentrate container 352 . The fully dissolved contents then fall into the user's cup 312 . As in the case of the coffee maker 200 described above, the coffee making process may have a first part where the heated water dissolves all of the soluble coffee (along with any soluble additives) and a second part where the heated water continues to flow through the mixing chamber 388 to rinse out and disinfect the mixing chamber 388 . During the second part of the coffee making process, any remaining coffee that remains in the mixing chamber 388 may be forced out of the mixing chamber 388 by the flow of water. FIG. 20 is a cross-sectional view of a container 410 a , which may be integrally disposed within the coffee maker 300 to serve as the mixing chamber 388 . The container 410 a may be the same as the food grade paper container 110 of FIGS. 11 A, 11 B, and 11 C, including having an internal shape that is the same as that of the body 112 of the food grade paper container 110 and having one or more holes 414 that are the same as the one or more holes 114 of the food grade paper container 110 , with the following differences related to its integration in the coffee maker 300 . In particular, the container 410 a may or may not have the same external shape as the food grade paper container 110 , since the container 410 a may be fixed within the coffee maker 300 and need not be handled by the user. The container 410 a may, for example, be formed as a passageway through the coffee maker 300 from the mouth 317 of the coffee maker 300 to the holes 414 . Another difference from the food grade paper container 110 is that the container 410 a may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 of the coffee maker 300 by a water input line 422 , a cream concentrate input line 424 , and a flavor concentrate input line 426 . As shown in FIG. 20 , the water input line 422 , which may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 leading to the water reservoir 368 , pump 382 , and heater 386 , may be disposed in an upper portion (e.g. top half or top quarter) of the container 410 a , while the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 , which may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 leading to the cream port valve 355 and flavor port valve 354 respectively, may be disposed in a lower portion (e.g. bottom half or bottom quarter) of the container 410 a . By entering the container 410 a in an upper portion, the heated water for dissolving the soluble contents of the container 410 a may have the most opportunity to dissolve the soluble contents of the container 410 a (i.e. the formed soluble coffee product 120 and any formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products) as it passes through gaps 123 a , 123 b around and between the soluble contents as described above in relation to the food grade paper container 110 . As a result, even in the case of a high stack of soluble contents, the heated water will not pass through the holes 414 and out of the container 410 a without first flowing along the soluble contents to further the dissolving process. In some cases, the water may be pumped by the pump 382 at a high enough pressure to cause the water to shoot out from the water input line 422 and land on the soluble contents at or near the middle of the container 410 a . In this way, the container 410 a can be arranged so that water flows against the soluble contents once as it flows from the middle of the container 410 a to the periphery of the container 410 a , along the side of the soluble contents as it flows down, and then again as it flows from the periphery of the container 410 a inward toward the holes 414 at the bottom of the container before exiting the container 410 a , further improving the efficiency of dissolving as described above in relation to the food grade paper container 110 . Meanwhile, since the cream concentrate and flavor concentrate need not be dissolved and need only be mixed, the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 may be disposed in the lower portion of the container 410 a . If the cream/flavor concentrate quickly arrives at the holes 414 , that is not a problem as the mixing of the concentrates with the heated water (with dissolved coffee) can still occur in the user's cup 312 . By disposing the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 in the lower portion of the container 410 a , the room temperature concentrates can be prevented from prematurely cooling the heated water while the heated water is dissolving the soluble contents of the container 410 a . In particular, the cream and flavor liquid which are not heated may have a shorter distance out of the container so that the heated water can be as hot as possible. FIG. 21 is a cross-sectional view of a container 410 b , which may be integrally disposed within the coffee maker 300 to serve as the mixing chamber 388 . The container 410 b may be the same as the food grade paper container 110 b of FIG. 17 , including having an internal shape that is the same as that of the body 112 of the food grade paper container 110 b (including two or more nested receptacles 115 ) and having one or more holes 414 b that are the same as the one or more holes 114 b of the food grade paper container 110 (and may similarly be arranged in sets corresponding to the nested receptacles 115 ), with the following differences related to its integration in the coffee maker 300 . In particular, the container 410 b may or may not have the same external shape as the food grade paper container 110 b , since the container 410 b may be fixed within the coffee maker 300 and need not be handled by the user. The container 410 b may, for example, be formed as a passageway through the coffee maker 300 from the mouth 317 of the coffee maker 300 to the holes 414 b. Another difference from the food grade paper container 110 b , is that, just like the container 410 a , the container 410 b may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 of the coffee maker 300 by a water input line 422 , a cream concentrate input line 424 , and a flavor concentrate input line 426 . The water input line 422 , cream concentrate input line 424 , and flavor concentrate input line 426 may be structured and function in relation to the container 410 b in the same way as described above in relation to the container 410 a . For example, the water input line 422 may be disposed in an upper portion (e.g. top half or top quarter) of the container 410 a to improve the efficiency of dissolving as described above, while the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 may be disposed in a lower portion (e.g. bottom half or bottom quarter) of the container 410 a to prevent premature cooling of the heated water as described above. In the above examples of FIGS. 20 and 21 , it is described that the container 410 a and container 410 b may be integrally formed with the coffee maker 300 to function as the mixing chamber 388 thereof. However, the disclosed embodiments are not intended to be so limited. It is also contemplated, for example, that the container 410 a and container 410 b may be insertable and removable from the coffee maker 300 , or that the food grade paper container 110 , 110 b may be insertable and removable from the coffee maker 300 . In this case, a user may, for example, freely insert the food grade paper container 110 , 410 a for use with wafer-shaped formed soluble coffee products and insert the food grade paper container 110 b , 410 b for use with spherical formed soluble coffee products (e.g. coffee balls). The mixing chamber 388 of the coffee maker 300 may, for example, be a cavity connected to the tubing or piping 356 that leads to the water reservoir 368 , pump 382 , and heater 386 , the tubing or piping 356 that leads to the cream port valve 355 , and the tubing or piping 356 that leads to the flavor port valve 354 . The cavity of the mixing chamber 388 may also include means of locating the food grade paper container 110 , 110 b , 410 a , 410 b within the mixing chamber 388 , such as an annular ledge around the periphery of the mixing chamber 388 on which the one or more stoppers 116 of the food grade paper container 110 , 110 b may rest. When the coffee maker 300 is operated, the heated water, cream concentrate, and/or flavor concentrate may flow into the mixing chamber 388 at a position higher than the food grade paper container 110 , 110 b , 410 a , 410 b via the tubing or piping 356 . The heated water, cream concentrate, and/or flavor concentrate may thus flow into the food grade paper container 110 , 110 b , 410 a , 410 b to prepare a cup of coffee as described above. Referring now to FIGS. 22 - 34 , a method of making a formed soluble coffee product 120 is shown. The formed soluble coffee product described in FIGS. 22 - 34 will be referred to as reference numeral 420 . The method used to make the formed soluble coffee product 420 may be used to make the formed soluble coffee product 120 . The formed soluble coffee product 120 , 420 fabricated from this method may quickly dissolve in water having a temperature between slightly above freezing and 200 degrees F. Preferably, the formed soluble coffee product 120 , 420 quickly dissolves (i.e., 1-15 seconds, under 10 seconds, or under 5 seconds) in hot water above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The formed soluble coffee product 120 , 320 has minimal or no waste. As such, it does not pollute the environment similar to a coffee pod sold by Keurig. Rather, there may be only a thin wrapper to help protect the formed soluble coffee product 120 , 420 from contamination. The formed soluble coffee product 120 , 420 may also be used in conjunction with a single serve coffee making machine. If so, then the formed soluble coffee product completely dissolves in the holder (e.g., traditional coffee pod holder) of the formed soluble coffee product before the serving of hot water finishes dispensing from the single serve coffee machine so that the remainder of the serving of hot water can clean and sanitize the holder. As shown in FIG. 22 , the method may comprise a step of inserting 422 a liquid coffee concentrate into a cavity 422 of a mold 424 , 424 A. The liquid coffee concentrate discussed herein may have a water content of about 1% to 10% by weight but preferably has a water content of about 2-5% by weight. Next, the liquid coffee concentrate may be transitioned into a solid form, or simply put, frozen. This is accomplished by reducing 426 the temperature of the liquid coffee concentrate. The temperature of the liquid coffee concentrate can be reduced by placing the mold 424 , 424 a into a refrigeration unit or a refrigerator. The refrigeration unit may be set to about 6 degree Fahrenheit. From room temperature (e.g., 80 degrees Fahrenheit) to freezing temperature (e.g., 32 degree Fahrenheit), the length of time that it takes for the liquid coffee concentrate to freeze may be about four hours. At the time the molds are placed in the refrigeration unit, a machine 426 for thermally reducing, solidifying and dehydrating may be turned on in order to prepare the machine to receive the frozen liquid coffee concentrate after it has been frozen. The refrigeration unit brings the temperature of the liquid coffee product at least below a temperature (e.g., 40 degrees Fahrenheit) of the machine 426 at a start of the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration. After the liquid coffee concentrate freezes, the mold may be removed 428 from the refrigeration unit. The frozen liquid coffee concentrate may also be removed from the cavity 422 of the mold 424 , 424 a . Freezing the liquid coffee concentrate to a shape and placing the frozen liquid coffee concentrate in a corresponding shaped cavity of a tray 432 helps to maintain the shape of the formed liquid coffee product 420 when the product is processed in the machine 426 . When the liquid coffee concentrate was being frozen in the refrigeration unit, the mold 424 , 424 a encapsulated the entire frozen liquid coffee concentrate. However, in order to prepare the frozen liquid coffee concentrate for the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration in the machine 426 , the frozen coffee may now be placed 430 on a tray 432 so that entire frozen coffee is not entirely covered by the mold 424 , 424 a but exposed to air. The tray 432 is now placed 431 in the machine 426 . At the start of the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration by the machine 426 , the machine 426 may receive the frozen liquid coffee concentrate in a cavity which has been brought down to about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. The process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration may heat and freeze the frozen liquid coffee concentrate. The length of time for completing the process on the frozen coffee may be adjusted so that the formed soluble coffee product forms an outer crust which is harder than an interior of the formed soluble coffee product. For example, the process performed by the machine 426 may be set to nine (9) hours to form the harden outer crust which is harder than the interior portion. This is for a 1-inch spherical ball of liquid coffee concentrate. The hard-outer crust makes the formed soluble coffee more durable for transportation and handling by the end user. After performing the process of thermal reduction and solidification on the frozen coffee, the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated formed coffee is now removed 434 from the machine 426 . After the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated formed coffee is removed 434 from the machine 426 , an exterior surface of the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee may be coated 436 with a thin layer of dissolvable, edible layer. Referring now to FIG. 23 , the mold 424 is shown. The mold 424 may be fabricated from a silicone material so that it is bendable and flexible, as shown in FIG. 24 . The silicone mold 424 may have a plurality of cavities 422 . The mold 424 may have a first and second halves 438 , 440 . Each of the first and second halves may have the plurality of cavities 422 . The plurality of cavities 422 in the first half 438 may match up with the plurality of cavities 422 in the second half 440 to form a solid. The cavities 422 of the first and second halves 438 , 440 may be any shape such as hexagonal, polygonal, cylindrical, spherical, cube, pyramid, heart, bunny shape, smiley face, etc. More particularly, when the first and second halves 438 , 440 are attached to each other as shown in FIG. 23 , the cavities 422 in the first and second halves 438 , 440 matches up with each other and form a solid object. The cavities 422 may have any shape desired by the manufacturer. For example, the cavities 422 in the first and second halves are semi-spherical so as to form a spherical frozen coffee product. However, other shapes are also contemplated such as cube, pyramidal, hexagonal, polygonal, cylindrical, egg shaped, heart shaped, etc. The cavities 422 may have any shape in order to form any shape of solidified coffee. The formed soluble coffee product 420 may be solid and formed in the shape of the cavities 422 . In the example shown in FIGS. 22 - 32 and 39 , the shape is spherical. The mold 424 may have a different configuration. By way of example and not limitation, referring now to FIG. 27 , the mold 424 a is shown. The mold 424 a may have first and second halves 438 a , 440 a . The first and second halves 438 A, 440 A may have or may each have a plurality of cavities 422 A, which made up to form the shape of the frozen coffee or thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product. The mold 424 A may be fabricated from a rigid material such as a plastic material that could withstand low temperatures. Referring back to FIGS. 23 - 25 , the first and second halves 438 , 440 may be attached to each other as shown in FIG. 23 . In order to attach the first and second halves 438 , 440 to each other, each of the halves 438 , 440 may have a mating knobs 442 and holes 444 . The plurality of knobs 442 may mate with and engage the receiving holes 444 in the first half 438 . Preferably, when the knobs 442 are engaged to the cavities 444 , the first and second halves mate with each other and form a generally water tight enclosure, so that when liquid coffee concentrate is placed inside of the mated cavities 422 , the liquid coffee concentrate does not spill out and through between the mating surfaces of the first and second halves 438 , 440 . Moreover, if a better seal between the mating surfaces of the first and second halves 438 , 440 is required, the first and second halves 438 , 440 may be coated with a temporary adhesive or sealant so that when the first and second halves 438 , 440 are pushed together the adhesive or sealant forms a generally water tight barrier therebetween. Moreover, because the liquid coffee concentrate may have a consistency or viscosity similar to that of molasses, the liquid coffee concentrate may not seep between the surfaces of the first and second halves 438 , 440 as easily as water. Also, the liquid coffee concentrate may be flash frozen so that the liquid coffee concentrate hardens or freezes in the refrigeration unit before the liquid coffee concentrate can seep through between the mating surfaces of the first and second halves 438 , 440 . It is also contemplated that in lieu of or in addition to the temporary adhesive or on the mating surfaces, the sealant or adhesive may be placed at the outer periphery of the mold at the joint of the mating surfaces so that the liquid coffee concentrate does not seep out of the mold 424 , 424 a. Once the first and second halves 438 , 440 are engaged to each other as shown in FIG. 23 , the mold 424 is positioned so that an aperture 446 formed by the first and second halves 438 , 440 is disposed on the top side of the mated first and second halves 438 , 400 . The aperture 446 may be utilized to pour the liquid coffee concentrate 448 into the mating cavities 422 in the first and second halves 438 , 440 . By way of examples and not limitation, the liquid coffee concentrate may be disposed within a squeeze bottle 450 (see FIG. 25 ). A nozzle 452 may be placed adjacent to the aperture 446 , and the liquid coffee concentrate may be squeezed into the aperture 446 to fill the mating cavities 422 . Once the mating cavities 422 is filled, the user then fills the next mating cavities 422 until the entire mold 424 is filled with the liquid coffee concentrate. The same process may also be used in relation to the mold 424 A shown in FIG. 27 . Referring now to FIG. 26 , an optional stick 454 may be placed into the aperture 446 , 446 a with a distill end portion of the stick 454 being inserted into the liquid coffee concentrate disposed within the mating cavities 422 . The stick 454 may be between about one inch and 10 inches, and if preferably about four inches. The distill end portion of the stick 454 may also have a roughened exterior surface 456 so that the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product does not slip off of the stick 454 after the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration, and while the user manipulates the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product during use. The distill end portion 458 of the stick 454 may be roughened as shown in FIG. 32 , but it is also contemplated that the distill end portion 458 may be cavitated so that the liquid coffee concentrate is locked inside of the cavitation to prevent the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product from falling off of the stick 454 during use and before the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product is being dissolved in hot water. Other configurations are also contemplated for the distal end portion 458 of the stick 454 such as an enlarged distill end portion (e.g., bulbous configuration, ball). These other configurations would also mitigate the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product from falling off of the stick 454 . The stick 454 may be placed in each of the apertures 446 in the mold 424 . Optionally, it is not necessary for the stick 454 to be used. If it is not used, then the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product would be handled by hand, spoon or dropped in hot water then stirred with a spoon or fork in lieu of the stick 454 . At this point, the mold 424 , 424 a , liquid coffee concentrate and the stick 454 are set up to be placed within the refrigeration unit to freeze the liquid coffee concentrate. The mold, 424 , liquid coffee concentrate disposed within the cavities 422 of the mold 424 and the stick 454 are placed in the refrigeration unit to begin the freezing process of the liquid coffee concentrate. Preferably, the liquid coffee concentrate is brought to a freezing temperate as fast as possible. Typically, if the refrigeration is set to between zero degrees Fahrenheit and 32 degrees Fahrenheit (preferably 6 degrees Fahrenheit), it may take the liquid coffee concentrate about four hours to go from a liquid state at room temperature (e.g., 80 F) to a frozen state. The mold 424 , 424 a with the liquid coffee concentrate may be left in the freezer for about four hours. Thereafter, the mold 424 , 424 a is removed from the refrigeration unit. The second half 440 of the mold 424 , 424 a is removed from the first half 438 of the mold 424 , 424 a . The frozen liquid coffee concentrate may be slightly stuck to the inner surfaces of the cavities 422 of the mold 438 , 440 . Removing the first half 438 from the second half 440 will detach the frozen liquid coffee concentrate from one of the halves 438 , 440 . At this point, the user may grab the stick 454 and twist the stick 454 in the direction of the arrow 458 . By twisting the stick 458 , the frozen liquid coffee concentrate is detached from the inner surface of the cavity 422 of the other half 438 , 440 of the mold 424 . The same is true with the mold 424 a is used. Referring to FIG. 29 , when the second half 440 a is removed from the first half 438 a , the sticks 454 are pointing straight up. The user grips the stick 454 and rotates the stick 454 to detach the liquid coffee product from the surface of the first half 438 a of the tray to the tray mold of 424 a. Referring now to FIG. 30 , a low temperature silicone tray 432 is shown. The low temperate silicone mold or tray 432 may be able to withstand the low temperatures experienced or imposed upon it by the machine 426 . The tray 432 may have a plurality of cavities 458 . These cavities 458 may correspond to an outer configuration of the frozen coffee product so that as the frozen coffee product goes through the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration, the shape of the frozen coffee product is retained. By way of example and not limitation, the frozen coffee product shown in FIG. 30 has a spherical configuration of a certain diameter. The cavities 458 may have a semi-spherical configuration having a diameter equal to the certain diameter of the frozen coffee product. Beneficially, because the frozen coffee product has been removed from its original mold 424 , 424 A, the surface of the frozen coffee product can now out-gas the liquid within the frozen coffee product during the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration in the machine 426 . Moreover, the tray 432 is not covered so that at least half of the frozen coffee product may be exposed to the air within the machine 426 during the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration to help with the out gassing of the liquid in the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration. The process of removing the frozen liquid coffee concentrate from the mold 424 , 424 a and placing them onto the tray 32 and placing the tray with the frozen liquid coffee concentrate into the machine 426 is time sensitive because when the mold 424 , 424 a is removed from the refrigeration unit, the frozen liquid coffee concentrate will heat up and tend to melt. As such, the entire process after removable of the mold to inserting the frozen liquid coffee concentrate into the machine 426 must be accomplished before the frozen liquid coffee concentrate melts too much so that the shape has excessively degraded. The tray 432 may be placed on a metallic or rigid member 460 , which is used to support the flexible silicone tray 432 during transport from outside of the machine 426 to one of the levels or supports in the machine 426 . The frozen liquid coffee concentrate and the tray 432 are now placed 431 into the machine 426 . The door of the machine is opened. The rigid member 460 holding the tray 432 is now placed onto the support 462 of the machine 426 . The machine is now placed into its cycle and allowed to run through its process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration until the frozen coffee product is now solidified. Preferably, the process is allowed to run until the frozen liquid coffee concentrate has the structure shown in FIG. 32 . In particular, the liquid coffee or thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product may have an overall outer diameter 464 of about one inch. The process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration may form a crust at the outer peripheral portion 466 . The thickness of the crust portion 466 may be about 0.005 of an inch thick to about 3/16ths of an inch. For example, the length of time is preferably about 9 hours. The machine 426 removes the moisture but preferably leaves the coffee oil in the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product 420 . More preferably, the time for the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration is set so that the oil of the liquid coffee concentrate is disposed or trapped in the outer peripheral portion or crust of the formed soluble coffee product. By way of example and not limitation, after the process of thermal reduction, solidification and dehydration has run its full nine (9) hour course, the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated soluble coffee product 420 may optionally be left in the machine 426 about one hour to six hours more so that moisture in the machine 426 may be reabsorbed into the outer peripheral portion or crust of the formed soluble coffee product 420 to help form the crust and also to help retain the oil of the coffee in the outer peripheral portion of the formed soluble coffee product. This step of leaving the soluble coffee product in the machine about 1 to six hours more is optional. Other ways of increasing the hardness of the outer surface portion are also contemplated in addition to or in the alternative to this step. The hardness of the outer peripheral portion or crust may be greater than the hardness of its interior portion 468 . Preferably, the outer peripheral portion can withstand a pressure of about 1/16th of a pound to one pound. For example, if a thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product (as shown in FIG. 32 ) is placed on the table, a bar weighing 1/16th of a pound weight can be placed on the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product without crushing the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product. The transition between the outer peripheral portion having a greater hardness than that of the interior portion 468 may not be a specific defined line but may be a gradation. In this instance, the outer peripheral portion 466 is measured by the outer surface 470 of the outer peripheral portion to one half way between the gradation of the hardness levels between the outer peripheral portion 466 and the interior portion 468 . For example, if the crust had a hardness level of 9 and the interior portion 468 has a hardness level of 5, then the thickness of the outer peripheral portion 466 is defined as the thickness from the outer surface 470 to a place in the thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated coffee product having a hardness of 7. The size of the coffee ball (i.e., formed soluble coffee product) shown in the figures is about 1 inch in diameter. However, the size of the coffee ball may be between about 0.5 inch to 2 inches and preferably about 0.75 inch to 1.5 inch. After thermally reducing, solidifying and dehydrating the formed soluble coffee product 420 , optionally, the exterior surface of the formed soluble coffee product 420 may be coated with a layer or coating of cellulose gum that when dry or cured is anti-hygroscopic to water moisture in air but is hydrophilic when it is submersed in water. The cellulose gum may have a consistency of that of molasses and in order to reduce the viscosity to the appropriate level, an edible alcohol may be added to the cellulose gum. The cellulose gum maybe atomized into the air (i.e., sprayed as a mist) and the formed soluble coffee products 420 which has been thermally reduced, solidified and dehydrated may be hung on a conveyor chain and passed through the atomized cellulose gum in order to coat or form a layer over the exterior of the formed soluble coffee product 420 . Although the coating may be cellulose gum, it is also contemplated that the coating may be pullulan, pectin, starch, polyvinyl acetate, sodium alginate or combinations thereof including a combination of cellulose and anyone of the other listed materials. Other methods of forming the thin layer of cellulose gum on the exterior surface of the formed soluble coffee product 420 are also contemplated. By way of example not limitation, the formed soluble coffee product 420 may be dipped in a container of liquid cellulose gum that has been mixed with an edible alcohol to bring down the viscosity of the cellulose gum to a proper level, in order to form a thin layer of cellulose gum. The layer of cellulose gum being coated or formed over the formed soluble coffee product 420 may have a thickness of 0.001 inch to 0.010 inch. Although the material in which the product 420 is dipped in is described as a cellulose gum, the material in which the product 420 is dipped in may be pullulan, pectin, starch, polyvinyl acetate, sodium alginate or combinations thereof including a combination of cellulose and anyone of the other listed materials. Referring to FIG. 33 , the hygroscopic coffee core 500 may be hardened so that an outer peripheral portion 502 of the coffee product 504 may have a hard hydrophobic outer shell 502 . The hard hydrophobic outer shell 502 can be formed or added on to the hydrophilic and hygroscopic coffee core 500 . The hard hydrophobic outer shell 502 may be added to the hygroscopic coffee core 500 in the following manner. Roasted coffee beans may be ground 506 to a particular size, namely, course, medium or fine, as shown in FIG. 34 . The ground down coffee beans may be sorted by a screen size of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 or 20. Coffee is then extracted from the ground coffee. The coffee may be extracted by way of a drip coffee process, expresso process, pour over process, cold brew process or French press process. FIG. 35 shows a liquid coffee 508 in which the coffee has been extracted from the coffee beans. Regardless of the method of extracting coffee, water may be utilized to extract the coffee. The resultant liquid coffee 508 may comprise coffee oil, water and coffee fines. The coffee fines may be dissolved or dispersed. Coffee fines may have a size between one (1) to twenty five (25) microns. Preferably, the coffee fines may have a size between one to five microns. More coffee oil may be added to the liquid coffee to alter the composition of the liquid coffee. More coffee fines may be added to the liquid coffee to alter the composition of the liquid coffee. Other particulates (e.g., flavors) having a size between one to twenty-five microns, and more preferably between one to five microns may be added to the liquid coffee. The liquid coffee 508 may now be agitated in order to create a tight emulsion of oil, water and coffee fines. The colloidal emulsion may be created by agitating the water such as through shaking or blending the same. The liquid coffee may be agitated with a blender, a stirring tank, and/or a shaking tank. When the emulsion is created, the coffee oil molecules bind to the coffee fines electrostatically to a greater extent than the water molecules electrostatically bind to the coffee fines. After the colloidal emulsion is formed, the emulsified liquid coffee may be reduced to remove the water from the emulsified liquid coffee. FIG. 36 shows the liquid coffee 508 after it has been reduced 510 . The reduced liquid coffee shown in FIG. 36 has a lower percentage of water. More particularly, the water from the emulsified liquid coffee may be removed by heating the emulsified liquid coffee which breaks the electrostatic charges at different rates. The increased temperature evaporates out the water from the liquid coffee 508 at a higher rate because the electrostatic bond between the water and the coffee fines is lower compared to the electrostatic bond between the oil and the coffee fines. It is easier to break the electrostatic charge between the water and the coffee fines than the oil and coffee fines. The liquid coffee may be reduced to a viscosity between 500 and 70,000 centipoises, and more preferably between 5,000 to 10,000 centipoises. At the liquid coffee is reduced to a particular viscosity within the stated ranges above, the reduced liquid coffee may have a water content between 1% to 20% by volume. The reduced liquid coffee maybe applied to the entire exterior surface of the hygroscopic coffee core. By way of example and not limitation, the hygroscopic coffee core may be submersed (see FIG. 36 ) in a container 512 of reduced liquid coffee 510 then removed. Another way to form a layer of the reduced liquid coffee around the entire hygroscopic coffee core 500 is to pour the reduced liquid coffee over the hygroscopic coffee core 500 or to spray the reduced liquid coffee on the hygroscopic coffee core 500 . These processes form a layer of the reduced liquid coffee around the entire hygroscopic coffee core 500 . The layer of reduced liquid coffee may go through a drying process to dry the layer of reduced liquid coffee. By way of example and not limitation, the coffee core with the reduced liquid coffee can be sent through a dryer or it may be air dried. After drying, the reduced liquid coffee forms a hard outer shell 502 around the coffee core 500 . The hard outer shell 502 formed by the dried reduced liquid coffee may be hydrophobic in nature. In this manner, the hard hydrophobic outer shell 502 is added to the exterior surface of the hygroscopic coffee core 500 . Another method of covering the entire exterior surface of the coffee core may be by atomizing the reduced liquid coffee, as shown in FIG. 37 . This method shows how to add the hard hydrophobic outer shell 502 to the hygroscopic coffee core 500 . The atomized liquid coffee 514 may be sprayed into a path 516 that the hygroscopic coffee core 500 travels. The hygroscopic coffee core 500 may be passed through the space where the reduced liquid coffee has been atomized. The hygroscopic coffee core may be rotated 518 as it passes through the atomized reduced liquid coffee 514 . By way of example and not limitation, the hygroscopic coffee core 500 may be formed on a stick 520 which is rotated 518 (see FIG. 37 ). Other ways of rotating the hygroscopic coffee core 500 in the midst of the atomized and reduced liquid coffee are also contemplated. The atomized liquid coffee 514 may form a layer around the entire exterior surface of the coffee core 500 . The layer and the coffee core 500 may go through a drying process. By way of example and not limitation, coated coffee core may be passed through a dryer or the layer of atomized liquid coffee may be air dried. After the layer is dried, this layer may provide a hydrophobic hard exterior shell 502 to provide protection to the hygroscopic coffee core from water moisture in the air and physical impact during transport (e.g., train, vehicle, shipping) of the product from the manufacturer to the retailers. In another method, it is contemplated that the hygroscopic coffee core may be subjected to steam 522 , as shown in FIG. 38 . This method forms the outer peripheral portion of the hygroscopic coffee core 500 into a hard hydrophobic outer shell 502 . The coffee core 500 may be rotated 518 . In this way, the hard hydrophobic outer shell 502 may be formed as a part of the hygroscopic coffee core instead of added onto the hygroscopic coffee core 500 as in the methods described above relating to the reduced liquid coffee. When the hygroscopic coffee core 500 is exposed to steam, the water in the steam is attracted to the exterior surface of the hygroscopic coffee core 500 . The enter exterior surface of the hygroscopic coffee core 500 may be exposed to the steam (i.e., hot evaporated water). The exterior portion of the hygroscopic coffee core 500 may begin to form as a liquid. The liquid may fill any hole in the exterior surface of the hygroscopic coffee core 500 . The hygroscopic coffee core 500 is then removed from the hot steam and the exterior layer is allowed to re-solidify. When the exterior layer is re-solidified, it forms a hydrophobic layer 502 , which mitigates absorption of water from moisture in the air. The moisture in the air cannot penetrate through the holes because they were filled as stated above. The outer shell 502 is not purely hydrophobic, but may be resistant to absorption of water moisture in the air so that the product has an extended shelf life of greater than one month, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 4 years or more. Moreover, the hydrophobic layer 502 may also be harder than the inner hygroscopic coffee core 500 . In FIGS. 36 - 38 , the hygroscopic coffee core 500 is shown with a stick which may be used to manipulate the hygroscopic coffee core 500 as the same 500 is submersed in the reduced liquid coffee, rotated or exposed to steam or atomized reduced liquid coffee. However, other means of supporting the hygroscopic coffee core 500 is also contemplated such as by using a string tied to the hygroscopic coffee core 500 . The hardness of the outer shell may be sufficient to resist cracking when the dissolvable coffee is transported in a shipping container via train, bus, truck, or shipping. Referring now to FIGS. 39 and 40 , FIG. 39 illustrates the formed soluble coffee product 420 which has a stick 544 placed in a post 474 having a plurality of holes 472 . The sticks 454 of the formed soluble coffee product 420 may be placed in the holes 472 so that the formed soluble coffee products 420 extend outwardly from the post 474 . Each of the formed soluble coffee products may be wrapped with a wrapper 476 . The wrapper 476 may protect the formed soluble coffee product 420 from contamination. The post 474 maybe held upright by way of a base 478 . In contrast, a prior art container 480 may have a plurality of prior art coffee pods similar to ones that are used in a traditional single serve coffee machine such as KEURIG machine. Even though the formed soluble product 420 is placed on a post 472 , more formed soluble coffee products 420 may be stored in the same volume as that of the container 480 . There less waste when using the formed soluble coffee product 420 on a mass market scale when preparing a cup of coffee. The only waste would be the wrapper 476 , and the stick 474 , which in contrast to the coffee pod, would be significantly less in volume compared to the coffee pod of the prior art single serve coffee machine using a Keurig coffee pod shown in FIG. 39 . Referring now to FIG. 40 , a plurality of formed soluble coffee products 420 may be placed in a container 482 . The container 482 may be substantially smaller in volume compared to the container 480 , but nonetheless may hold an equal number of formed soluble coffee products 420 as the container 480 holds coffee pods for a single serve coffee machine (e.g. Keurig). The formed soluble coffee product shown in FIG. 40 does not have a wrapper 476 and does not have a stick 454 . This means that there is even less waste when using the formed soluble coffee products 420 shown in FIG. 40 . The formed soluble coffee product 420 may be provided with a stick 454 and wrapper 476 as shown in FIG. 39 or without as shown in FIG. 40 . The formed soluble coffee product 420 on a stick 454 may be shipped as shown in FIG. 39 or may be boxed up side by side so that formed soluble coffee products 420 are laid adjacent to each other in the box. Fortunately, the hard crust or outer peripheral portion of the formed soluble coffee product 420 mitigates breaking of the formed soluble coffee product 420 during shipping. Moreover, the wrapper 476 that surrounds the formed soluble coffee product 420 also acts as cushion to protect the formed soluble coffee product 420 from rupturing or any damage because of vibration or other hard impact during shipment, storage and handling by the consumer. Additionally, the anti-hygroscopic exterior shell extends a shelf life of the product 420 to at least 1 month because water moisture from the air does not degrade the integrity of the outer peripheral portion. To prepare a cup of coffee, the user may remove the formed soluble coffee product 420 from the post 474 or from the box, unwrap or remove the wrapper 476 , and while gripping the stick 454 submerse the formed soluble coffee product 420 in a cup of water, and more preferably a hot cup of water. The formed soluble coffee product is a quick dissolve so that once the formed soluble coffee product 420 is submersed in hot water, it will dissolve within seconds. Although the outer shell is anti-hygroscopic to air water moisture, when the outer shell is submersed in water, then the thin outer shell rapidly dissolves. The user may then use the stick 454 to mix the coffee completely, and also use the stick 454 to mix any cream or sugar that might be added to the prepared coffee. Referring now to FIG. 40 , to prepare a cup of coffee, the user may unscrew the cap from the container 482 and remove one ball 420 of the formed soluble coffee product from the container 482 . The formed soluble coffee product 420 may be dropped into a cup of water, preferably a hot cup of water. The user may then use a spoon or other stirring instrument to mix the dissolved formed soluble coffee product in the water. The container has been described as a food grade paper container. However, containers fabricated from other types of materials are also contemplated. By way of example and not limitation, the container may be fabricated from a plastic material, synthetic material or combinations thereof. Food grade paper container may include paper used in milk cartons.

In addition a new type of packaging for coffee is disclosed that maintains the freshness of the bean while allowing easy distribution and verification of bean authenticity. BACKGROUND Coffee has traditionally been made using a three step process: roasting of coffee beans, grinding of roasted beans, and brewing of ground beans in hot water to extract the flavor into a beverage. These three steps are traditionally done at different times and locations. Roasting is typically done in large industrial machines in large batches of many pounds to hundreds of pounds at a time. Roasted beans or ground beans are shipped to local retailers and this step can take weeks to months before the package arrives for the consumer to brew, where the consumer may be the retail home consumer or other businesses such as coffee shops that brew and sell coffee. Roasted beans decay in freshness and taste from the moment the roast is completed as chemical compounds formed in the bean during roasting deteriorate. The decay of roasted beans leads to a less desirable taste of coffee. Thus all coffee made today is stale due to the time delay from roasting to brewing. SUMMARY Embodiments of a coffee preparation machine include at least one pod containing coffee beans, a roasting system that accepts the at least one sealed pod, a grinding system, and a brewing system, where the brewing system, the roasting system, and the grinding system are housed within a single self-contained unit.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The taste of coffee is determined by the type of coffee beans used and by numerous process parameters in each step of making the coffee beverage. A key set of parameters influencing coffee taste, happen during roasting. The roast process is typically done in an industrial batch setting as described above and the end consumer has no control over the roast process and, thus, the taste of the coffee beverage as determined by bean roast. Additionally, the degree of roasting for each bean type can transform the taste of the final coffee beverage to an individual consumer's liking, yet this degree of control does not exist in the coffee industry today. A consumer may buy prepackaged beans with different degrees of roast but the user cannot dial-in and control the roast of beans to taste. Coffee has evolved in recent years from a widespread commodity product with ‘generic’ tasting coffee products to specialty coffee where specific beans, origin location, microclimates, growing conditions, year of production, and processing conditions are tracked and marketed. These variations in the source beans affect the taste of the coffee beverage and, thus, are tracked and marketed to the final consumer. Coffee has many aromatic compounds that affect aroma and taste, where coffee contains more aromatic compounds than wine. Just as wine is marketed by region, year, vineyard, etc., with varying prices for each, coffee can be marketed similarly. A key issue with such marketing is assuring the end consumer that the product being purchased is genuine and not counterfeit. This allows the consumer to know the value of his purchase and to possibly sell that product in the future for value that may increase or decrease. To solve these and other problems we describe a series of embodiments that allow the preparation of the freshest and best tasting coffee ever made. The solution to the problems stated above is to change the method of coffee preparation at the consumer side and to change the distribution method of green coffee beans from plantation to consumer. Coffee Bean Verification Coffee plants are grown in approximately fifty countries worldwide, typically in the tropical regions of the world, at high elevations. The coffee cherry is picked from the plant and after several process steps, dried green coffee beans are produced. These beans can vary widely in quality and taste leading to a large difference in price. Commodity green coffee beans are priced at approximately $2/pound and traded on international commodity markets. Specialty green coffee beans with specific taste and terroir have sold for up to $500/lb. However it is difficult for a person to determine the origin of a green bean by physical observation and, thus, expensive beans may be counterfeited. To prevent counterfeiting, several new embodiments are proposed. As shown in FIG. 1, one embodiment includes laser marking each coffee bean 10 with a laser 12 to create a custom code that is difficult or impossible to copy. A key feature here is to mark the surface of bean only without damage to the inside of the bean. An alternate embodiment includes mechanical marking (not shown) of the surface of each bean with a specific code without damaging the inside of the bean. Embodiments include the application of visual marking material (not shown) to a coffee bean in a custom pattern that cannot be copied. This may include fluorescent materials that emit only when stimulated with the proper external optical stimulus. These materials may be organic (e.g., a green fluorescent protein or other materials) or inorganic. Of key importance is to use only biologically safe materials and materials that burn off during coffee roasting leaving no trace in appearance or taste. In one embodiment, DNA sequencing of beans can be performed on reference bean samples from desired locations. This sequence data can be stored and compared to DNA sequence data of the green coffee beans at a later date to verify location of the bean. DNA can survive in the green coffee bean state, but degrades rapidly with increasing temperature (DNA denatures at just below 100 C). Thus, keeping beans in the green state until final consumption aids verification. Once the beans are roasted, extracting DNA sequence information from the bean becomes difficult or impossible. Such embodiments may provide a novel approach to provenancing. A unique feature of the coffee preparation method embodiments described below is that the roasting is performed at the time of final beverage preparation by the consumer and thus these anti-counterfeiting methods will maintain their integrity through the distribution chain of coffee until the final preparation when verification testing can be performed, if desired. Traditional coffee preparation involves roasting at an earlier stage, as described above, and all marking methods would be destroyed during roasting. A key parameter in specialty coffee is to validate the origin and terroir (special characteristics of the geography, geology and climate of a certain place) that affect coffee taste. This comes under the terminology of food provenancing (chronology of the ownership or location of a historical object). Embodiments include using spectroscopic methods to verify provenance of coffee beans by measuring spectroscopic data (e.g., molecular compounds, ratios of different elements, etc.) as close to the source location as possible and creating a library of coffee bean spectroscopic data. This library of data is used to compare with later spectroscopic measurements for verification when the provenance of any bean is called into question. Spectroscopic techniques to be used may include mass spectrometry, laser spectroscopy, LIBS (laser induced breakdown spectroscopy), ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), or any other methods. A key feature of this invention is the use of spectroscopic signature to verify provenance to the location of coffee bean growth and the subsequent ability to verify beans after packaging into coffee pods. By keeping the beans in the green state, this spectroscopic information can be extracted, whereas this information may be destroyed at the temperatures of coffee roasting. Coffee Pod Embodiments A growth area in the coffee market is the use of single-serve coffee pods for consumer preparation of coffee in one cup portions. Advantages of coffee pods include convenience, single serve preparation so that coffee does not sit aging in pots, and ability for consumer to choose amongst pod types. For these reasons, coffee brewing machines using pods have exploded in sales growth in the last decade (e.g., SENSEO, NESPRESSO, KEURIG, etc.). These coffee pods typically are small plastic or metal containers with ground coffee and filter paper inside. These coffee machines and pods all use ground coffee and the machines only brew the coffee. As noted above, coffee degrades in freshness from the moment it is roasted, and degrades even more rapidly once it is ground, since increased surface area interacts with atmosphere. Embodiments include a new type of coffee pod in which green coffee beans are packaged into small enclosed containers or pods, where each pod (e.g., pod 14 shown in FIG. 13) contains enough green coffee beans to ultimately produce one serving of coffee. The pod 14 may be hermetically sealed with a seal 37 . These pods can be used with a specially designed coffee preparation machine that is described herein. The novelty here is to use green coffee beans that have a long shelf life and do not degrade rapidly (shelf life of green coffee beans is years or more if stored properly). The coffee pod 14 is filled with a gas to preserve the enclosed beans without degradation to long periods (years to many years). This fill gas may be atmospheric air, nitrogen, inert gas, noble gas, or the pod 14 may be vacuum packed. In some cases the pod 14 may be filled with positive pressure gas (e.g., nitrogen, noble gas, or others). Each pod 14 would contain approximately 10-50 grams of green coffee beans. In certain cases, certain beans are known to improve with age and exposure to air, where pods 14 containing such beans may be packaged with a ‘breathable membrane’ (not shown) that allows air to be exchanged with the outside world. A further embodiment is to sort and package the green beans with beans of a similar size and color packaged into a single pod 14 , and likewise do this for all pods 14 . The value of this sorting is that roasting of all beans within a single pod will progress similarly when exposed to heat and thus produce a uniform roast. This sorting system may also sort out bad beans that may have phenol content or other impurities that impair taste of the final beverage. Further value of this sorting will become apparent in the discussion of the machine below. The pod 14 can be marked with an information code 38 or bar code (not shown) that contains information about the beans in the pod 14 . This information can be used by the machine described below and will: allow the machine to verify the authenticity of the coffee pod and prevent fake pods from working in the machine, and encode bean information and optimum preparation recipe instructions that the machine can read. The information code may be printed in some form not visible to naked eye to preserve the aesthetic appeal of the pod 14 . The pod 14 may have features built into the design that either prevent tampering with the pod or indicate if tampering has occurred. Other features in the pod package may be deliberately designed to be hard to reproduce to act as anti-counterfeit measures. The pod 14 may be made of recyclable materials. The pod 14 may have features in the physical design to allow non-invasive measurement of the spectral features of the beans to verify provenance of the bean as described above. The pod 14 would be designed in conjunction with the machine described below so that the pod 14 fits into the machine and the machine automatically opens the pod 14 so the green coffee beans can be accessed for processing without contaminating the machine or green beans with remnants of the packaging material. A key goal of the pod 14 and packaging methods mentioned above is to create a pod 14 that is designed for long life of the enclosed beans without bean degradation. In particular, the goal is to create the ecosystem for storing, collecting, trading, and consuming specialty green coffee beans that can be turned into a coffee beverage in an analogous manner to how fine wine is collected, stored, traded, and ultimately consumed. Fine wine may go up or down in value as the provenance of the specific wine gains or loses reputation amongst collectors of wine, and due to supply and demand constraints. Similarly, fine green coffee beans have analogous taste and aroma characteristics that cannot be artificially duplicated, so a limited supply of specialty beans can create a tradable value amongst connoisseurs. The purpose of high quality pod packaging described is to create a long lasting product (lasting years, decades, or longer) that enables a green coffee bean ecosystem to evolve just like the fine wine ecosystem. The coffee pods may be purchased for near term consumption or may be purchased for long term collectible value. The pod 14 may contain green unroasted coffee beans where some processing step has been performed on the beans. One method may be to grind the beans in a factory setting and package the ground green beans into the pod 14 . Grinding the beans first may help in faster roasting of beans (described below in the machine section). Another option may be to partially roast green coffee beans and package into the pod 14 , which may save roasting time for the final consumer. However this partial roasting should be done in a way that preserves the freshness of the bean and prevents the decaying/staleness of the bean as in conventional roasting. E-Commerce Embodiments The coffee machine 16 (FIG. 8) described herein will have an internet connection and can upload and download information to or from computer servers attached to the internet. These servers may be owned and maintained by the company selling the coffee making machine and would provide numerous functions. The company would also maintain a website that would allow the sale of coffee preparation machines and coffee pods 14 . The website would also have information to educate the consumer about the coffee pods and the provenance/terroir of the coffee pods. This information can include professional tasting ratings, user generated feedback forums on taste, and information about the source of each pod 14 . A novel function of the website is allowing the auctioning or trading of coffee pods since the pods are designed to be collectible and may go up or down in value based on supply and demand. This portion of the website may function something like an EBAY for coffee pods, though a number of different auction methods may be used. This auction website may offer an additional service to buyer and seller to verify the pods for authenticity, non-tampering of pod, no air leak of the pod; etc. The pods 14 will be sold with optimized preparation recipes encoded (explained more below in the machine section). However, the consumer may choose to experiment with process parameters to suite individual taste. The user may decide to upload their personal recipe for a specific pod type to the website for free access by all, or may choose to upload the recipe and charge others for access. The website would handle the transaction and take a percentage of sale price for facilitating transaction. Along similar lines, there may be chefs, celebrities, or others who may wish to create branded recipes specific to each type of pod 14 . The website would facilitate the exchange and/or sale of these recipes (e.g., a Wolfgang Puck recipe for Guatemalan Finca bean, an Usain Bolt recipe for Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, etc.). This could be considered an analogy to how app stores have evolved for software on mobile phones except in this case it is an ‘app store’ for recipes for coffee preparation. Coffee Preparation Machine Embodiments The coffee preparation machine 16 is a key to the inventions described above and all the pieces described work together. Here we describe the inventions in coffee preparation enabled by the new coffee machine 16 . Coffee preparation involves three keys steps: 1) roast green beans, 2) grind beans, 3) brew coffee. In all previous cases, roasting is done separately from grinding and brewing. Coffee machines exist on the market that brew coffee from ground coffee, coffee machines exist that grind roasted beans and brew coffee, and coffee machines exist that brew single serve coffee from coffee grounds packaged in pods, however, all of these machines require roasted coffee beans that have been roasted separately as mentioned previously. Here we describe for the first time a coffee machine 16 that encompasses roasting, grinding, and brewing in a single machine. The green coffee beans for this machine 16 are provided to the machine 16 in a standardized single serve pod 14 described above. Thus this machine 16 is a single serve roast/grind/brew machine that provides the user control over every step of the coffee preparation process and the freshest coffee ever made. Typically roasting of coffee beans is performed on large scale machines and can take up to 10-20 minutes per batch. Here, we describe technology to enable fast roasting of green beans in small quantity in less than three minutes so that the user does not have to wait a long time for coffee. We believe that delivering the ultimate cup of coffee to the consumer in a few minutes is key to enabling a viable machine since the user would not wait the 10-20 minute roast time of traditional roasting to get a cup of coffee. The features of this machine are novel and describe a new invention in the coffee industry. This machine 16 may be used in any number of professional/restaurant settings or may be used in the home. Roasting Process The traditional sequence of coffee making is to roast green beans, grind beans, and brew coffee. An alternative approach is to grind the green beans, roast the ground beans, and brew coffee. This alternative sequence is not done in any coffee making machine and thus is novel. The purpose of the alternative approach is that the green beans are ground to a small size, which results in more surface area exposed to heat during roasting and enabling faster, more uniform, heat transfer throughout the green bean particles. This allows more uniform roasting and faster roasting, both of which are desirable. Variations on this concept can include 1) coarse grind green coffee beans, 2) roast coarse grind beans, 3) fine grind the roasted particles, 4) brew coffee. Other slight variations in this sequence should be considered part of the novelty we suggest. Typically the three steps in making coffee mentioned above (roast, grind, brew) are done as three separate discrete steps. However, we propose a novel concept of partial or complete overlapping of these steps in time or space to reduce the total time required to make coffee. For example, the roasting and grinding may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may begin as some beans are roasted. Another example is that grinding and brewing may occur in the same vessel and the grinding may occur in a wet grind process which initiates the brewing process. Other variations of combining process steps can occur and we consider the concept of combining process steps in a single coffee making machine to be novel. The machine, such as machine 16 shown in FIG. 10, may have an array of sensors 18 built in to measure process parameters along with feedback control systems to optimize the performance of each step the machine 16 performs (i.e., roast, grind, brew). For roasting such sensors may include a camera/color sensor to determine color change of beans during roasting, a humidity/water sensor to measure the water content in a roasting chamber 30 , a humidity sensor for ambient local air, a carbon dioxide sensor to measure CO2 emission during roasting, an optical spectroscopy system to measure chemical emissions during roasting, a temperature and time measurement along with roast profile control, and a microphone sensor to listen for first crack of the beans, second crack of the beans, and other noise emissions during roasting. For grinding, sensors 218 may include optical sensors to visually monitor grind size, use of a vibration sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) to monitor progress of grinding, a microphone to measure noise from grinder to determine grind size, etc. Since the grind process makes audible noise, it may be possible to use active noise canceling techniques along with an embedded audio speaker to mute or minimize the noise generated by the grinder 40 . For the brewing system 50 , sensors may include, a water temperature sensor, a water pressure sensor, a water pH sensor, an optical absorption sensor, an optical light scattering sensor, an optical polarization sensor to measure coffee extraction from the grind, a refractometer to measure coffee extraction, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors to measure other chemical parameters of brewing, and other chemical sensors. The use of such sensors integrated into a coffee making machine for monitoring and feedback control is novel. One of the key functions of the machine is the roasting of coffee beans in single serve portions with the green coffee beans provided in small pods. The roasting must happen quickly in order for the consumer to enjoy a cup of coffee within a few minutes. Traditional coffee bean roasting has been performed in large batches on industrial scale machines where roasting can take 10-20 minutes per batch, or in large industrial machines where the machine is continuously in operation and pre-heated to a high temperature such that roasting can be performed in a shorter time period. In both of these cases, these are large industrial machines that roast quantities from many pounds to thousands of pounds of green beans. The key difference here is that we need to rapidly roast a small quantity of green coffee beans (up to a 50 grams in weight) within a few minutes. This type of roasting machine is not currently made since we need very fast heat up time from the moment the user initiates the machine to make coffee. Roasting of coffee beans is typically done between 200 C to 300 C (and up to 500 C in some cases). Thus the roaster (e.g., roasting system 30 shown in FIG. 10) must rapidly rise in temperature from ambient temperature of approximately 20 C to several hundred degrees Celsius in a precisely controlled manner. Here we suggest ultrafast heater temperature increase ramp rate that can be in the range 1 to 10 C/second, 11 to 50 C/sec, 51 to 100 C/sec, 101 to 200 C/sec, or 201 C/sec and higher. Likewise at the end of roasting, the temperature must be rapidly cooled and thus the temperature decrease ramp rate can be in the range 1 to 10 C/second, 11 to 50 C/sec, 51 to 100 C/sec, 101 to 200 C/sec, etc. The overall time for roasting may be in the range of 1 to 30 seconds, 31 to 60 seconds, 61 to 90 seconds, 91 to 120 seconds, 121 to 300 seconds, etc. As described below, a rapid heating method is needed to roast the beans and this heat can be applied by convective, conductive, or radiation means. Thus the roasting portion of the entire machine is novel in that the quantity of beans and the speed of roasting is different from what is done currently. In order to roast beans quickly, we need a fast heating method that enables rapid temperature rise of the bean. Conventional ovens use electrical resistor heating elements that heat the air in the chamber, and this air then heats the sample in question through convective heating. A direct approach to heating is to use laser 12 (FIG. 1) heating. In laser heating of green coffee beans, a laser of specific wavelength, spot size, and power level is directed via an optical system to the green coffee beans 10 , which absorb the radiation and heat up. We have demonstrated that laser heating of green coffee beans can be used to rapidly roast green coffee beans. The use of a laser 12 allows direct heating of the bean 10 without heating up the air or other space around the bean 10 . Also, this approach allows very precise delivery of heat to the bean 10 since the heat source can be removed when the laser 12 is turned off or blocked. The laser 12 can be operated in continuous mode, pulsed mode or some sequential combination of these modes to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize bean 10 roasting (FIG. 2). This is a novel invention in that using lasers to rapidly roast green coffee beans has not been done before. The beans 10 may be agitated mechanically or with air to move them into the path of the laser beam. The laser beam delivery system may be mounted on a mechanical system 22 to move the beam across the array of coffee beans 10 that need to be roasted. Optical systems may be used to distribute the laser light uniformly upon the beans, or may be used to create a desired illumination profile across the coffee beans. The laser 12 used for illumination may be a diode laser, a diode laser single emitter, an array of diode laser single emitters, a diode laser bar, or diode laser stack of bars as desired. The laser diodes may operate in the visible wavelength range, the near infrared wavelength range, or other infrared wavelength range. The wavelength of operation may be chosen to correspond with specific spectral absorption features of the coffee bean 10 . A benefit of operating in the near infrared wavelength range is the commercial availability of high power laser diodes that have been developed for solid state laser pumping. The roasting may also be done using a combination of heating methods including laser radiation method along with convective resistive heating. In another embodiment of optical heating methods, a light emitting diode (LED) may be used instead of the laser light source with an appropriate optical system to direct the light from LED to the coffee beans. In another embodiment, microwave energy may be used to rapidly heat and roast the beans (e.g., a microwave oven). As shown in FIGS. 3-7, another approach to roasting green coffee beans is again to use radiation heating. In this case, we can use infrared or visible wavelength emission lamps 24 as the heating element. The green coffee beans absorb the radiated light from the bulb and heat up until roasted (the bulb may emit in the visible wavelength range, infrared wavelength range or some bands of wavelengths deemed desirable such as MIR, FIR, etc.). The use of a lamp 24 allows fast roasting and direct heating of the green coffee bean 10 within a transparent tube 11 and is a novel invention. The lamp 24 can be operated in continuous, pulsed, or some combination of these modes, to provide the exact dose of thermal energy to optimize bean roasting. Lamps 24 emit light in multiple directions and some emitted light may not hit the beans. Thus to efficiently use the optical energy, it may be preferable to use optical cavity designs 26 to collect and direct the emitted light to the target coffee beans. Such optical cavity designs may include elliptical reflective cavities, multi-ellipse cavities, circular reflective cavities, etc. A number of cavity designs have been proposed in the lamp pumped laser industry that direct pump laser light to the absorbing laser rod. These cavity designs can be applied to roasting coffee whereby the laser rod is replaced with a glass tube containing coffee beans. Cross section diagrams of these geometries are shown in FIG. 3-7. It is a novel invention to use optical cavities 26 to capture and direct light to coffee beans for rapid roasting. The optical cavity 26 may also be designed to illuminate the beans 10 with a desired intensity profile for specific roasting as desired. The roasting may also be done using a combination of heating methods including lamp radiation method along with convective resistive heating. Though we have shown several cavity designs 26 , there are other cavity designs that may be used that capture and direct light to a focal spot while also homogenizing the focal spot light intensity. After roasting of coffee beans, it may be desirable to rapidly quench the beans 10 (i.e., rapidly cool down the beans) to stop the ongoing processes in the bean due to latent heat inside the bean. This may be done in one of several ways including water immersion quenching or forced air quenching. In particular, grinding the beans into small particles immediately after roasting increases surface area. Thus quickly grinding the beans and flowing air or water through the grinds quenches the bean from continuing to roast. In addition, the water used to brew the coffee serves also to quench the heat of the beans since the water used for brewing will be just under 100 Celsius in contrast to the several hundred degree Celsius roast temperature. During roasting of green coffee beans, the color of the beans changes from green to dark brown/black depending on the length of time roasted (a longer time gives a darker color). Traditionally, these roast types and colors are denoted coarsely as cinnamon/New England; city/full city; Vienna; espresso; Italian; French. In our approach to roasting, the use of quantitative measurements and methods such as precision imaging and signal processing will allow us to denote a much finer gradation in roast progress and thus much finer taste control. As the beans are roasted, some smoke may be emitted and chaff is released from the outside skin of the bean. The machine 16 may capture the smoke and may capture the chaff. During the roasting process the beans emit a defined popping sound at different times during roasting known as first crack and second crack. These sounds are indicative of roasting process and audio monitoring of this sound with feedback control may be used to optimize roasting. During roasting, the beans emit an aroma that is pleasant to many people and a desirable trait to smell. The machine may have features to capture and disperse this aroma outside of the machine into the local environment for the pleasure of the consumer. In another variation, the machine may capture the aroma scent into a small container or other device that can be opened later to release the aroma as desired by the user (or the aroma containment system could be attached to a coffee cup with aroma released in a time release manner). The machine 16 would be able to roast, grind, and brew, as mentioned above. Since the roasting process requires heat, it may be possible to recover extra waste heat from this process to heat or pre-heat the water needed for the brewing process. As one example, water may passed over the hot beans after roasting which serves to quench the beans and heat the water (but not limited to this method only). This is a novel approach to energy efficiency within the coffee machine and a new invention. Roasting of beans 10 may also be done on an individual basis to optimize taste. This is a novel concept that has never been done before in coffee making since roasting has traditionally been a large industrial process. The quantity of green beans needed for a single cup of coffee may range from 50 to 500 beans. For this discussion we use 100 beans to simplify the discussion, but the concepts apply to any number of beans. When using a radiative light based heating system (e.g., laser, LEDs, lamp, etc.), the beans may be aligned in a pattern with a corresponding pattern of illumination sources (this may be a 1:1 mapping, or N:M mapping of sources to beans). An optical system may be used between the sources and beans such that each bean is illuminated by one light source with the desired illumination pattern. Each light source may have individual power control or sub-arrays of the light source may have a single power control. By using a 1:1 mapping of light sources to beans, each bean may now be illuminated and heated with individual control. A camera may be used to image the color of the beans and along with image processing algorithms used to feedback individual power adjustment control to the individual light sources to optimize roasting (a wavelength selective filter may be placed in front of the camera to filter out the light used to roast the beans). This may mean roasting all beans to exactly the same degree of roast (e.g., color of roast) or it may mean creating a ‘roast blend’ where some beans are roasted to a different degree purposefully to get a desired taste profile in the final beverage (as an alternative, for the lamp based system, several separate cavities may be created with each cavity containing a subset of beans and each lamp can be controlled separately based on feedback sensors to optimize roast within that cavity). The beans from the several cavities are mixed before grinding. It may be possible to use an array of small resistive heating elements with each element in contact with one bean as an alternative to a light based heating system. In any of these cases, this is a completely novel invention to individually control roasting of coffee beans. The machine 16 would automate handling of the beans to move them from stage to stage of processing as needed. For example, moving between roasting and grinding, or moving between grinding and brewing. This may be considered as a robotic handling method that is new in a coffee machine. The machine 16 would have a receptacle for accepting the coffee pod 14 . The pod would be sealed but the machine 16 would have a method for automatically opening the pod 14 and dispensing the contents as needed to the first stage of processing. Grind Embodiments The machine 16 would have a grinding stage 40 where the roasted beans are ground into fine particles. The average particle size may vary between 50 microns to 2000 microns. The electrically powered grinder would be adjustable to a desired particle size. The grinder may be a blade grinder 29 , burr grinder 28 (e.g., a disc burr grinder, conical burr grinder, etc.), or any other grinder. A grinder that produces a uniform particle size is desirable. The time taken for grinding may be 1 to 10 seconds, 11 to 30 seconds, 31 to 60 seconds, 61 to 120 seconds, or 121 seconds and greater. After the roasting stage, the machine automatically moves the beans from the roasting stage to the proper location for grinding. After grinding, the machine automatically moves the beans to the proper location for brewing. The time taken to move between stages may be less than or equal to 1 second, 1.01 to 10 seconds, 10.01 to 45 seconds, etc. Brewing Embodiments After grinding, the ground particles are moved into the brewing stage 50 . Coffee brewing is performed by passing heated water through the grounds which extracts the coffee into the liquid. The machine would have a rapid water heating system 32 to quickly bring water to the proper temperature. The water temperature may be brought to boiling (212 F), or some other temperature range such as 150 to 160 F, 161 to 175 F, 176 to 195 F, 196 to 211 F, etc. A water temperature in the range of 195 to 205 F is considered to be desirable for brewing coffee. The coffee grounds may be placed in a chamber with a filter at the bottom of the chamber and the filter may be paper or metallic. The coffee grounds may be tamped or compressed by the machine 16 as desired. The pressure of compression may be varied by the machine 16 as desired. The water may be injected into this chamber at high pressure. The water pressure may range from 0.1 bar to 18 bar depending on the coffee type (e.g., coffee, espresso, etc.) desired and the desired taste of coffee. A refractometer or other sensors may built into the coffee machine to provide real time measurement and feedback control of various brew parameters to optimize coffee taste. The time required to brew coffee would ideally be <1 minute. The amount of water used in making the cup of coffee may be any amount from 0.1 ounces to 20 ounces. The brewing time may be <1 second, 1.01 to 30 seconds, 30.01 to 60 seconds, or 60.01 seconds or longer. In an alternative brewing method, the water may be poured on top of the coffee grounds and mixed with the grounds. The coffee liquid may then be ‘sucked’ out of the chamber with a vacuum system 34 . The coffee grounds would remain in the chamber separate from the coffee liquid due to a filter that does not allow the coffee grounds to pass. The total time for making a cup of coffee with this machine from the time the user initiates operation may be <30 seconds (e.g. method 100 as shown in FIG. 11), 30.01 to 60 seconds, 60.01 to 120 seconds, 120.01 to 180 seconds, 180.01 to 300 seconds (e.g., method 200 shown in FIG. 12), or 300.01 seconds or greater. As mentioned earlier, it is desirable that the coffee making machine make the cup of coffee as fast as possible while maintaining highest quality. The machine would dispense the coffee into a coffee cup. Additional Embodiments The machine 16 may have the capability to infuse 36 flavors and/or nutrients/vitamins into the final beverage. At stages after roasting, the machine may inject flavors (e.g., chocolate, hazelnut, etc.) or nutrients (e.g., vitamins, antioxidants, etc.) into the mixture such that this material is retained in subsequent steps and remains in the final beverage. The machine 16 may have an internet connection either through wired or wireless means. This internet connection would enable the features described above. In particular, the machine 16 would be able to interact with central servers to upload and download information about beans, optimized recipes for preparation, initiating coffee preparation from remote or local mobile devices, mobile apps, etc. One purpose of the many controls used in this machine 16 is to optimize the taste of the beverage for the final consumer to their specific desires. The taste sensors (taste buds) on each person's tongue are unique and different and cause individuals to respond differently to the same preparation. Thus, we envision the possibility of a method to determine the variation in taste sensors on a person's tongue and using that information to optimize the coffee making process to that individual. This effectively requires a sensor system that can map and ‘taste’ the corresponding taste sensors on the tongue, which can be done optically, spectroscopically, or through chemical sensors that map the tongue. This information could then be transmitted to the coffee machine 16 and algorithms optimize coffee preparation for that person's tongue. In another application of using lasers to assist in the coffee making process, the coffee beans could have small holes drilled through the bean using a laser. High pressure water could be injected through these holes to fracture the bean (e.g. bean fracking) into small particles and thus replace traditional grinding. Additionally it may be possible to inject hot water or steam into the small holes and use this to brew or extract the coffee from the bean in a new way (e.g. ‘in bean brewing’). The steam passes thru the beans and is condensed to form the beverage. Another way to make coffee using a coffee pod system is to perform all functions of roast, grind brew within the pod itself. The pod with green coffee beans may contain resistive heater elements that mate to current sources in the machine to roast coffee. Or the pod may be transparent to allow optical energy provided by the machine to impinge upon the beans and roast the beans. The machine may break the seal of the pod or puncture the pod as needed during these steps. Another approach to grinding is to apply sonic energy to the roasted beans to cause the beans to fracture into small particles; and/or high pressure water may be applied to the beans to cause them to fracture. Water may be injected into the pod in order to brew the coffee.","10213047"

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates generally to processes for isolating and extracting antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from coffee cherries and antioxidant-rich products and compositions made from coffee cherries. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The fruit of the coffee plant (e.g., Coffea arabica ) is often called the “coffee cherry.” The coffee cherry is made up of the following layers (from the outside in): skin, pulp, mucilage, parchment, and bean. The skin, also referred to as the epicarp or exocarp, is a monocellular layer covered with a waxy substance ensuring protection of the fruit. The mesocarp includes the pulp and the mucilage. The pulp is the fleshy outer layer of the mesocarp, directly beneath the skin, which during processing can be removed with a pulping machine. The mucilage is the slimy layer found between the pulp and parchment, adhering to the parchment inside a coffee cherry. It is generally not removed by pulping. Mucilage is not present in unripe coffee fruit, and disappears in overripe coffee. The endocarp, or “parchment,” is the tough integument tightly pressed to the bean when fresh but from which the bean shrinks during drying. It lies between the fleshy part (or pulp) of the cherry and the silver skin. The endocarp also includes the thin, crumbly paper-like covering that is left on wet-processed coffee beans after pulping and fermentation, and which is subsequently removed during hulling. The bean includes the endosperm and the embryo. The endosperm includes the tissues that feed the embryo during germination. The embryo ultimately forms the coffee beans. The silver skin is the seminal integument covering the endosperm, i.e., the thin, papery, shiny layer immediately surrounding the coffee bean, being the remnant of the integument. During processing, milling before export removes most silver skin, and the remainder is removed during roasting in the form of chaff. The endosperm fills the integument as the coffee cherry ripens. The coffee cherry is harvested and processed to make coffee. During processing, the bean portion of the cherry is removed and further processed using various techniques. This processing generally removes the bean, silver skin and parchment. Thus, after the bean is removed, a significant amount of the coffee cherry fruit remains. Traditionally, the portion of the cherry remaining after the bean is removed is viewed as waste, although it is sometimes processed into compost or animal feed. However, this remaining portion has significant nutritive value. In particular, it is high in antioxidants and polyphenols, including chlorogenic acids of various types, caffeic acid, quinic acid, ferulic acid, proanthocyanidins, and others. These compounds have antioxidant activity, which can contribute to good heath by reducing oxidative injury and thus ameliorating associated disease states such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of cardiovascular and neurological conditions. The beneficial anti-oxidative and other properties of such compounds, as well as other beneficial components of the extracts, can also be used to treat other conditions such as skin disorders and the like. Isolating these antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from the de-beaned coffee cherry can be difficult, however. For example, coffee pulp contains high levels of tannins, which bind the protein and make it difficult to extract and precipitate. An additional problem is that the free phenols in coffee pulp become oxidized to quinones. Quinones are oxidizing agents that may oxidize amino acids in coffee cherry proteins. Also, ripe coffee fruit is used during husking, and exposure to oxygen, and also the activity of enzymes, sugars, and other components of the coffee cherries, can cause rapid degradation and/or oxidation of these compounds and rapid bacterial growth either prior to or during processing. These degradative processes can begin almost immediately following removal of the bean. As a result, currently available methods of isolating the beneficial components from coffee cherries have frequently resulted in poor yields and the presence of undesirable side-products. As such, there remains a need in the art for improved methods of isolating antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from coffee cherries and antioxidant-rich products and compositions made from coffee cherries. The present invention satisfies these needs and provides related advantages as well.

Introduction Human cells create “life energy” through oxidation processes; however, excessive oxidation can also cause cell damage. The human body has various systems of controlling oxidation in our cells by using antioxidants. However, because of factors resulting from our highly industrialized society-including pollution, radiation, stress, and our busy lifestyles-our bodies cannot eliminate oxidation as fast as it accumulates, causing a vast range of health issues. Reducing oxidation and the oxidation damage from the human body is one of the most important issues for human health. Creating a supply of antioxidant large enough to supply humans on a global scale has been the greatest issue as antioxidant-rich materials are difficult to source and expensive to process. Coffee is the world's second largest agricultural crop, but only a small percentage of its fruit, the bean, is used. Using the present invention, the “by-product” of coffee production, which has previously been viewed as waste, can provide a valuable source of the powerful antioxidants and other beneficial compounds contained in the fruit to make them more readily and abundantly available to the general public. In certain aspects, the present invention provides methods for preparing a liquid coffee fruit extract where de-beaned coffee cherries containing skin, pulp, and mucilage are frozen under substantially oxygen-free conditions at a temperature of less than about −30° F. and then thawed prior to and during the extraction step in a heated aqueous solvent such as hot water. Without being bound by any particular theory, the large change in temperature when the de-beaned coffee cherries are added to the heated aqueous solvent causes the cells of the coffee fruit to “burst,” releasing antioxidants, nutrients, and other compounds from inside the cells. The resulting liquid coffee fruit extract is advantageously highly concentrated with antioxidants including polyphenols as well as nutrients and other compounds (e.g., has a Brix value of about 40), and typically has a minimum of about 5% (w/w) (e.g., at least about 20% (w/w)) total phenolic acids including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid, and quinic acid. The liquid coffee fruit extract has beneficial anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. In certain other aspects, the present invention provides methods for preparing a dried coffee fruit product where de-beaned coffee cherries containing skin, pulp, and mucilage are dehydrated in two steps that initially brings the moisture level of the de-beaned coffee cherries to about 10% to about 15% and then brings the moisture level down to about 2% to about 4%. In certain embodiments, the dried coffee fruit product can be sprayed with a liquid coffee fruit extract described herein to fortify the dried coffee fruit product by enriching it antioxidants including polyphenols as well as nutrients and other compounds present in the concentrated liquid extract. The unfortified or fortified dried coffee fruit product can be ground into a coffee fruit powder. The resulting coffee fruit powder is advantageously highly concentrated with antioxidants including polyphenols as well as nutrients and other compounds, and typically has from about 7% and about 12% (w/w) total phenolic acids including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid, and quinic acid. The dried coffee fruit and powder products have beneficial anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. II.

III. Selection of Coffee Cherries and Preparation for Further Processing The coffee cherries can be at any stage of ripeness that is consistent with the presence of antioxidants, nutrients, and other beneficial compounds from the coffee cherries. The stage of ripeness is generally reflected by the amount of green coloring that remains on the surface of the coffee cherries, with more green coloring indicating increasingly less ripeness. The coffee cherries for use in the methods described herein can be green over, for example, about 50%, about 40%, about 30%, about 20%, about 10%, about 5%, or about 1% of their surface, or the coffee cherries can be ripe, that is, red in color. In exemplary embodiments, the coffee cherries are ripe or nearly ripe (e.g., less than about 10% or less than about 5% green on their surface). The coffee cherries can, for example, be de-beaned prior to further processing, or the entire (whole) coffee cherry can be employed. In exemplary embodiments, the coffee cherries are de-beaned. However, wherever “de-beaned coffee cherries” is used herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that entire coffee cherries can be substituted. Thus, the present invention is particularly applicable to the use of ripe cherries used in a coffee production process after the de-beaning. These cherries are generally viewed as waste from the production process owing to their rapid degradation. The de-beaned coffee cherries used in the methods described herein typically contain skin, pulp, and mucilage. As used herein, unless the context indicates otherwise, “skins,” when used in reference to coffee fruit, can be understood as equivalent to “de-beaned coffee cherries.” Providing De-Beaned Coffee Cherries De-beaned coffee cherries for use in the methods of the present invention can be provided using any method known in the art, such as the methods described herein. In exemplary embodiments, whole coffee cherries are received, washed, and floated in water to eliminate “floaters.” Undesirable cherries, including overripe or underdeveloped cherries float. Selected cherries are then “de-beaned” (pulped) using a coffee pulping machine which separates the coffee bean and coffee fruit. De-beaned coffee cherries, which can also be referred to herein as coffee fruit or skins containing pulp and mucilage, can optionally be sprayed with a preservative coating via an electric or hand operated sprayer attached to the pulping machine. The de-beaned coffee cherries can travel through a liquid medium (water) to the coffee fruit collection point, at which point the coffee fruit can be put into a press/extruder to remove the excess water on the skins that accumulated from transport. Alternatively, a vibrational screen or centrifuge can also be used to remove the water. Optional Preservative Coating The optional preservative coating can be applied to the de-beaned coffee cherries promptly after de-beaning. The optional preservative coating can have the effect of inhibiting the degradation of the antioxidants and other beneficial compounds in the coffee fruit, for example, by preventing oxidation or enzymatic degradation. For example, phenolic compounds in the coffee fruit can be oxidized by an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase (PPO). This process is evidenced by the browning of the coffee fruit. Also, coffee fruit enzymes can convert free phenols and amino acids to quinic acid. The coating retards these degradative processes and denatures the enzymes that promote oxidation, thus preserving higher amounts of antioxidants, amino acids, and free phenols. As used herein, “promptly” means within a period of time that is consistent with preservation of all or a substantial portion of the antioxidants and other beneficial compounds in the coffee cherry. “Promptly” can mean, for example, within about 24 hours, within about 12 hours, within about 6 hours, within about 4 hours, within about 3 hours, within about 2 hours, within about 1 hour, within about 45 minutes, within about 30 minutes, within about 15 minutes, within about 5 minutes, within about 1 minute, within about 30 seconds, within about 15 seconds, within about 10 seconds, or within about 5 seconds or less after the previous step in the process, or after the event referenced, as applicable. For example, the coating can be applied within about 5 minutes, or within about 1 minute, or within about 30 seconds after de-beaning. The optional coating can include, for example, one or more of ascorbic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, sulfur dioxide, sulfites such as potassium sulfite or combinations of two or more of these compounds. For example, the coating can include a combination of ascorbic acid and citric acid in water or another suitable solvent. The ascorbic acid can be used in an amount of up to or about 1 gram per gallon, 2 grams per gallon, 3 grams per gallon, 4 grams per gallon, 5 grams per gallon, 6 grams per gallon, 7 grams per gallon, 8 grams per gallon, 9 grams per gallon, 10 grams per gallon, 11 grams per gallon, 12 grams per gallon, 13 grams per gallon; 14 grams per gallon, 15 grams per gallon, 20 grams per gallon of water or suitable solvent or more, or about 10-30, about 10-20, or about 12-16 grams per gallon. In some embodiments, powder such as a food-grade powder of ascorbic acid can be used. For example, the ascorbic acid can be present in about 15 grams food grade powder per gallon of water or other suitable solvent. The citric acid can be used in an amount of up to or about 0.5 grams per gallon, 1 gram per gallon, 2 grams per gallon, 3 grams per gallon, 4 grams per gallon, 5 grams per gallon, 6 grams per gallon, 7 grams per gallon, 8 grams per gallon, 9 grams per gallon, 10 grams per gallon, 11 grams per gallon, 12 grams per gallon, 13 grams per gallon, 14 grams per gallon, 15 grams per gallon, 20 grams per gallon or more, or about 1-15, 2-10, or 5-10 grams per gallon. In some embodiments, powder such as a food-grade powder of citric acid can be used. The ratio of ascorbic acid to citric acid can be from about 4:1 to about 1:4. In exemplary embodiments, the ratio of ascorbic acid to citric acid can be about 4:1 to about 1:2, about 3:1 to about 1:1 or about 2:1. For example, the coating can be made up of about 15 grams of ascorbic acid and 7 grams of citric acid per gallon of water. One gallon of the coating can be used to treat about 100-200, about 125-175, or about 150 pounds of de-beaned coffee cherries. Optional Storage of Coffee Cherries Before Processing Depending on the circumstances under which the process is being performed, it may be desirable to store the de-beaned coffee cherries before they are further processed. In such circumstances, the storage can be done under substantially oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions. As used herein, “substantially oxygen-free conditions” and “oxygen-free conditions” are used interchangeably and mean conditions under which the de-beaned coffee cherries or processed components thereof are protected against exposure to oxygen in such quantities or activities as to favor the oxidative and/or enzymatic degradation of the antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds in the de-beaned coffee cherries. Any level of oxygen that fails to produce substantial oxidative and/or enzymatic degradation of antioxidants and/or beneficial compounds is encompassed within “oxygen-free conditions.” Oxygen-free conditions can be achieved, for example, by removing most or all oxygen from the environment around the coffee cherries, for example by evacuating and sealing a container holding the coffee cherries, or by replacing oxygen with a different gas, including an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, or combinations thereof. Other means of achieving oxygen-free conditions can also be utilized, for example by immersing the coffee cherries in a fluid with little or no oxygen or oxidative activity, such as a citric acid/ascorbic acid mixture disclosed herein, or lemon juice, sodium metabisulfate solution or sulfur dioxide, or by rendering ineffective or inactive the oxygen that is present in the environment. For example, oxygen-free conditions can be achieved by placing the coffee cherries in one or more containers and evacuating the containers. The containers can be any suitable airtight unit designed for storage, including food-grade poly bags, containment drums with or without liners, trash cans with or without liners, and/or trash/lawn/freezer bags, and can be of any capacity, for example, of about 50 lb. capacity. Any step in the methods described herein can be suitable for performing under oxygen-free conditions. If the de-beaned coffee cherries are to be stored under oxygen-free conditions, the coffee cherries are generally subjected to such conditions promptly after the cherries are de-beaned, for example, within about one minute after de-beaning. For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be transported for about 1 minute before being bagged, vacuumed, and sealed. In other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are stored under oxygen-free conditions after about 2, 3, 4, 5, or more minutes. Whether or not stored under oxygen-free conditions, the de-beaned coffee cherries can also be stored under refrigerated conditions. As used herein, the term “refrigerated conditions” means any conditions of temperature that are effective to inhibit oxidative and/or enzymatic degradation of the antioxidants and other beneficial compounds in coffee cherries. Thus, refrigeration represents one readily and economically achievable method of reducing or eliminating the activity and detrimental effect of any oxygen or residual oxygen in the environment. Refrigerated conditions may also serve to promote cell lysis in the coffee cherries, which promote release of beneficial compounds from the cells, facilitating further processing. Such conditions may also serve to denature enzymes that contribute to degradation of the coffee cherries. For example, the term “refrigerated conditions” encompasses temperatures lower than or at about 60° F., about 50° F., about 40° F., about 35° F., about 32° F., about 30° F., about 20° F., about 10° F., about 0° F., about −10° F., about −20° F., about −30° F., about −40° F., about −50° F., about −60° F., about −70° F., about −80° F., about −90° F., about −100° F., or lower. Temperatures below about 32° F. can also be considered freezing conditions. As such, the term “freezing conditions” is encompassed within the term “refrigerated conditions.” For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be stored under freezing conditions. If the de-beaned coffee cherries are to be stored under refrigerated conditions, they are subjected to such conditions promptly after the cherries are de-beaned, for example within about 15 minutes, about 5 minutes, or about 2 minutes after de-beaning. In exemplary embodiments, removal of oxygen and refrigeration (e.g., freezing) is performed promptly following de-beaning. De-beaned coffee cherries that are subjected to storage under oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions can be stored under such conditions for any length of time that is consistent with preservation of at least a substantial portion of the antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds in the coffee cherries. Such storage can last, for example, up to about 2 hours, about 4 hours, about 6 hours, about 12 hours, about 24 hours, about 3 days, about one week, about 2 weeks, about one month, about 2 months, about 3 months, about 4 months, about 5 months, about 6 months, about 12 months, about 18 months, about 24 months, or longer. For example, such storage can last up to about 6 months, though frozen de-beaned coffee cherries that have reached the time limit can be processed and preserved as dried skins. Should transport be desirable in order to deliver the coffee cherries to a storage facility, such transport can also take place under oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions. IV. Process for Preparing Coffee Fruit Extract In one aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing a liquid extract that is rich in antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from de-beaned coffee cherries. In this process, coffee cherries are selected, de-beaned, optionally sprayed with a preservative coating, and frozen under refrigerated conditions as described herein. In exemplary embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are frozen at a temperature of less than about −30° F. in a container such as a deoxygenated food-safe poly bag. In alternative embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are frozen at a temperature of less than about −30° F. in a container such as a food-safe poly bag without deoxygenating. In particular embodiments, de-beaned coffee cherries are frozen for a suitable period of time (e.g., about 24 hours) before they are partially or completely thawed for the extraction step. In alternative embodiments, frozen coffee cherries are promptly contacted with an aqueous solvent (e.g., at an elevated temperature) for the extraction step. Extracting Coffee Fruit Nutrients Extraction of the coffee fruit nutrients can be achieved by using any means known in the art that is suitable for extracting the antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds in coffee cherries. For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be contacted with an aqueous solvent such as water in an extraction tank. Other suitable solvents include methanol, ethanol, or a combination of either or both of methanol and ethanol with water. For example, the aqueous solvent can be about a 50/50 (measured by volume, by weight, or by w/v or v/w) mixture of water and ethanol, or water and methanol. In particular embodiments, the aqueous solvent is water. The water can be purified water, and such purification can be carried out by any known method, including for example reverse osmosis, membrane filtering, charcoal bed filtering, deionization, distillation or a combination of these methods. For example, the aqueous solvent can be lab-quality water, prepared by subjecting it to reverse osmosis and then de-ionizing it. For example, the water can be prepared by subjecting it to reverse osmosis, membrane filtering, and charcoal bed filtering to reach a high level of purity, e.g., <3 ppm, and then de-ionizing. The water or other extraction fluid can optionally contain additional preservatives such as ascorbic acid, citric acid, or others known in the art. The extraction can also be done using ultra-high pressure extraction (known as UPE), which can be useful for extracting phenols or other antioxidants or beneficial compounds in coffee cherries. In UPE, high pressure can be used to “push” the solvent through the material without excessive heat that could cause degradation. The temperature of the aqueous solvent can be an elevated temperature, for example, above room temperature. The temperature of the aqueous solvent can be, for example, at least about 70° F. 80° F. 90° F. 100° F. 110° F. 120° F. 130° F. 140° F. 145° F. 150° F. 155° F. 160° F. 170° F., 180° F., 190° F., 200° F., 210° F., or higher. The amount of the aqueous solvent used in the extraction can be expressed as a ratio versus the amount of de-beaned coffee cherries. For example, the aqueous solvent:coffee fruit ratio (in units of gallons solvent:pounds coffee fruit) can be at least about 0.01:1, 0.1:1, 0.2:1, 0.3:1, 0.4:1, 0.5:1, 0.6:1, 0.7:1, 0.8:1, 0.9:1, 1:1, 1.1:1, 1.2:1, 1.3:1, 1.4:1, 1.5:1, 1.6:1, 1.7:1, 1.8:1, 1.9:1, 2:1, or higher. The extraction can be carried out under oxygen-free conditions. In certain embodiments, extraction is achieved by adding frozen or partially or completely thawed de-beaned coffee cherries to a heated aqueous solvent such as hot filtered water (about 180° F.). Without being bound by any particular theory, the temperature difference between the coffee cherries and the hot water causes the cells to burst or lyse, releasing the nutrients (e.g., antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds) within the cells. In particular embodiments, de-beaned coffee cherries frozen at −30° F. are first slowly warmed from −30° F. to +30° F. in a controlled temperature room in a process that takes from about 8-16 hours (approximately overnight) before adding the (partially) thawed coffee cherries to a heated aqueous solvent such as hot water (about 180° F.) to perform the extraction of antioxidants and/or other beneficial compounds. The extraction steps described herein can be performed once, or they can be performed multiple times, in order to achieve desired purity and yield. In some embodiments, de-beaned coffee cherries to be extracted can optionally be subjected to a maceration step. During the maceration step, the de-beaned coffee cherries are chopped into fragments. The average size of the fragments can be, for example, less than about 5 cm, 4 cm, 3 cm, 2 cm, 1 cm, 9 mm, 8 mm, 7 mm, 6 mm, 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2, mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.1 mm or smaller, where the measurement reflects the largest dimension of length of the fragment. For example, the fragments can be about 0.5-2 mm or 1-2 mm. The maceration step can be performed using any means known in the art for such purpose, e.g., a maceration tank. In some embodiments, the maceration tank contains one or more grinder/maceration pumps at the bottom, and can be airtight and oxygen-free using nitrogen to replace the oxygen. As a non-limiting example, the tank can hold the solvent, including an aqueous solvent such as purified water, at a ratio of approximately 1 gallon to 1 pound (liquid extract to de-beaned coffee cherry). In some embodiments, “grinder pumps” can be used to pump the liquefied material to a sealed extraction vessel for extraction. For example, the maceration step can be carried out in a maceration tank under oxygen-free conditions. In other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries to be extracted can optionally be agitated (e.g., mixed). Agitation can be carried out by any method known in the art, for example by mechanical agitation (e.g., motor and blades), ultrasonic agitation (using, e.g., an ultrasonic transducer), and/or enzymatic agitation (e.g., by using introduced enzymes in accordance with methods known in the art). For example, the de-beaned coffee cherries can be agitated using mechanical agitation. Such mechanical agitation can be accomplished using a Lightnin agitator (Lightnin; Rochester, N.Y.). The de-beaned coffee cherries or fragments thereof if macerated can be agitated for a period of time, so as to facilitate the extraction process. For example, the mixture can be agitated for at least about 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 35 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, 1 hour, 1 hour 30 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours or longer. The mixture can, for example, be agitated for about 30-40 minutes or longer. The resulting extract can be filtered to remove particulate matter, including coffee cherry pulp sediment and/or skin pieces. Filtration methods are known in the art, and a person of ordinary skill can choose the appropriate filtration method from among those known. Non-limiting examples of such filtration methods include: 1) membrane filtration, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis with either spiral-wound, stainless steel, ceramic, tubular, or plate-and-frame configurations; 2) sediment clarifying, whereby a food-grade tank can be employed to hold the extract under oxygen-free conditions to allow sediment to collect at the bottom of the tank due to gravity, e.g., for a period of about 1-24 or more hours, and removing the bottom sediment using, e.g., a separator valve; 3) press and filter methods, whereby a mechanical, pneumatic, or hydraulic press can be employed to squeeze the extract through a sieve or a series of sieves, or screen with less than 5 microns in size to eliminate sediment; 4) centrifugation, whereby a centrifuge can be used to separate the solids by centrifugal force; and 5) vacuum filtration, which can provide another oxygen-free filtration method. For example, the extract can be filtered using a press and filter method through a fine screen to remove any pulp or skin pieces. The filtrate can then be collected in a container such as a food-grade holding tank, in which it can be stored under oxygen-free conditions. The holding tank can also be used for clarifying/filtering by gravity separation (described below), or for overflow management, e.g., if too much liquid is being processed for the evaporators to keep up, or if the evaporators are operating at full capacity. Particulate matter can also or additionally be removed by sedimentation, i.e., by allowing the mixture to stand and the particulate matter to settle to the bottom of the storage vessel, using methods such as those described above. After sedimentation, the supernatant liquid is removed for further processing. The supernatant liquid can optionally be filtered. Sedimentation, if used, can also be conducted under oxygen-free conditions, for example under a blanket of inert gas. The fluids and filtrate at this point can be referred to as a dilute extract. The particulate matter collected during filtration can optionally be processed further in a fruit/herb press, for example, a pneumatic press of 10 tons capacity (Eden Labs; Tacoma, Wash.), a hydraulic press, or similar device to generate additional fluid. The fluid generated by pressing the particular matter can then be added to the filtrate generated during the filtration step and added to the dilute extract. Evaporating and Concentrating Coffee Fruit Extract The dilute extract can be subjected to one or more evaporation steps. The evaporation step removes aqueous liquid content, and results in a more concentrated extract. Extract concentration is monitored using Brix measurements. Brix values are generally used to measure sugar concentration in a liquid, but they can also be used as a proxy for extract concentration, i.e., the higher the Brix value, the more concentrated the extract. The dilute extract can have a low Brix value, for example, less than about 10 Brix, 8 Brix, 6 Brix, 4 Brix, or lower, or between about 0.1 and 10 Brix, about 1 and about 5 Brix, about 1 and about 3 Brix, or about 3.5 and about 5 Brix, or from about 1.5 to about 2.5 Brix. The Brix value of the concentrated extract can be up to or at least about 1.5 Brix, 2.5 Brix, 5 Brix, 10 Brix, 15 Brix, 20 Brix X, 25 Brix, 30 Brix, 35 Brix, 40 Brix, 45 Brix, 50 Brix, 55 Brix, 60 Brix, 65 Brix, 70 Brix, 75 Brix, 80 Brix, 85 Brix, 90 Brix, 95 Brix, 100 Brix, or higher, or between about 30 and about 70 Brix, about 30 and about 60 Brix, about 30 and about 50 Brix, about 40 and about 60 Brix, or about 40 Brix or 50 Brix. The extract can be reduced by a ratio of up to about 5:1, about 10:1, about 15:1, about 20:1, about 25:1, about 35:1, about 40:1, about 45:1, about 50:1, about 60:1, or higher (where the ratio indicates initial versus final volume). Brix measurements can be conducted using a “Brix Meter” or “Refractometer.” The liquid extract can be concentrated to any desired level, from a relatively dilute extract to a very concentrated and viscous extract and even subjected to complete evaporation (e.g., less than about 10% moisture content, or about 4-6% moisture content or below) to provide a dry extract concentrate. The evaporation step can be conducted using any means and methods known in the art, for example, using a tube falling film evaporator, plate evaporator, a spinning band column evaporator, or a spinning cone evaporator. In a tube falling film evaporator, the liquid to be evaporated is distributed onto an upper tube sheet and onto heating tubes by an especially developed distribution system. From this system, the product flows downwards in the heating tubes to a lower tube sheet as a thin film. The evaporated vapor (steam) flows downwards in the same direction and consequently accelerates the flowing of the film. This limits the period of residence, during which the liquid to be evaporated is retained in the heating tube, to a few seconds. In a plate evaporator, the main feature is the compact design. The constructional height ranges from 3 to 5 meters depending on the design. Plate evaporators normally are designed for rising flow in single-pass operation. This keeps the thermal strain on the product as low as possible. Concentration of clear juice, or juice containing little pulp, are examples of application in the fruit juice industry. The spinning cone evaporator is a compact unit well-suited for the concentration of heat-sensitive, valuable and viscous products. It offers a short residence time, less thermal impact and greater processing flexibility than traditional rising or falling film evaporators. For example, the evaporation can be done using a spinning cone evaporator, such as Centritherm® evaporator (FT Technologies; Griffith, Australia). In exemplary embodiments, the evaporation step is conducted under low temperature conditions and/or at reduced pressure. As used herein, low temperature means a temperature less than or about 100° F., 90° F., 80° F., 70° F., 60° F., 50° F., or lower, or from about 50-100° F., 70-100° F., 50-80° F., 50-60° F., 60-70° F., 70-80° F., 80-90° F., or 90-100° F. For example, the evaporation can be done at a temperature of less than about 100° F. In some embodiments, the evaporation is performed under low temperature and oxygen-free conditions. In particular embodiments, evaporation can be carried out using vacuum-based techniques, e.g., using a vacuum concentrator to concentrate the liquid extract under low temperature conditions. The resulting concentrated extract can be stored under oxygen-free and/or refrigerated conditions, and can also be pasteurized if desired. Evaporation can be performed in multiple steps, where after a certain amount of time has passed or a particular Brix concentration measurement has been reached, additional filtration steps described herein can be performed. For example, evaporation can be halted when the liquid extract reaches a Brix concentration of about 20 and filtered using a gravity sediment removal step, whereby a food-grade tank can be employed to hold the extract under oxygen-free conditions to allow sediment to collect at the bottom of the tank due to gravity, e.g., for a period of at least about 12 or more hours, and removing the bottom sediment. Evaporation can then be continued to further concentrate the liquid extract until a Brix concentration of about 40 is reached and filtered again using another gravity sediment removal step. Additional filtration steps ensure minimal particulate matter and high quality of concentrated fruit extract. Once concentrated to the desired Brix level, the resulting extract is stored in a cool and dry place with no refrigeration required. The shelf-life of the liquid extract is about 18 months when stored at ambient room temperature conditions. The liquid extract concentrate has a high amount of antioxidants such as polyphenols and other beneficial compounds and typically contains at least about 5% (w/w) total phenolic acids. For example, the liquid extract can comprise a total phenolic acid concentration of from about 5% to about 50% (w/w), about 10% to about 50% (w/w), about 15% to about 50% (w/w), about 20% to about 50% (w/w), about 5% to about 40% (w/w), about 10% to about 40% (w/w), about 15% to about 40% (w/w), about 20% to about 40% (w/w), about 5% to about 30% (w/w), about 10% to about 30% (w/w), about 15% to about 30% (w/w), about 20% to about 30% (w/w), about 5% to about 25% (w/w), about 10% to about 25% (w/w), about 15% to about 25% (w/w), about 20% to about 25% (w/w), about 5% to about 20% (w/w), about 10% to about 20% (w/w), about 15% to about 20% (w/w), about 5% to about 15% (w/w), about 10% to about 15% (w/w), about 5% to about 10% (w/w), or about or at least about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% (w/w). Non-limiting examples of antioxidants include phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferluic acid, quinic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids of various types, and combinations thereof. The term “chlorogenic acid” includes a family of esters of hydroxycinnamic acids (e.g., caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid) with quinic acid and isomers thereof such as caffeoylquinic acids (CQA), with 3 isomers (3-, 4-, and 5-CQA), dicaffeoylquinic acids (diCQA), with 3 isomers (3,4-diCQA; 3,5-diCQA; 4,5-diCQA), feruloylquinic acids (FQA), with 3 isomers (3-, 4- and 5-FQA); p-coumaroylquinic acids (pCoQA), with 3 isomers (3-, 4-, and 5-pCoQA), six mixed diesters of caffeoyl-feruloyl-quinic acids (CFAQ), diferuloylquinic acids, dimethoxycinamoylquinic acids, caffeoyl-dimethoxycinamoylquinic acids, feruloyl-dimethoxycinamoylquinic acids, and combinations thereof. Other beneficial compounds include, but are not limited to, phytochemicals (e.g., flavonoids), vitamins, and/or other nutrients such as prodelphinidins, procyanidins, trigonelline, lignins, tannins such as condensed tannins, coffee saccharides, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and combinations thereof. V. Process for Preparing Dried Coffee Fruit In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing dried coffee fruit that is rich in antioxidants and other beneficial compounds from de-beaned coffee cherries. In this process, coffee cherries are selected, de-beaned, optionally sprayed with a preservative coating, and dried with a dehydrator as described herein. The de-beaned coffee cherries can immediately begin the dehydration process or can be stored for later processing by refrigeration (e.g., freezing at a temperature of less than about −30° F. in a container such as a deoxygenated food-safe poly bag). In some embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are sprayed with a preservative coating, but are not refrigerated (e.g., frozen at about −30° F.) before dehydrating. In other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are sprayed with a preservative coating and refrigerated (e.g., frozen at about −30° F.) before dehydrating. In yet other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are not sprayed with a preservative coating, but are refrigerated (e.g., frozen at about −30° F.). In still other embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries proceed to dehydration without a preservative coating spray or refrigeration (e.g., freezing at about −30° F.). Drying Coffee Fruit Drying of the coffee fruits, with or without protective spray/refrigeration steps, is achieved using one or more dehydration machines in a single step or multiple steps. In certain embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries are dehydrated to a lower water content, for example, to less than about 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or lower, by weight, in water content. For example, the coffee cherries can have a water content of about 4% (w/w) or less after dehydration (e.g., about 2% by weight for tea products). Any method known in the art for dehydrating food samples, including any suitable conditions of time and temperature, can be used with the processes disclosed herein. For example, the dehydration can be done under low heat, for example, up to or about 100° F., 105° F., 110° F., 115° F., 120° F., 125° F., 130° F., 135° F., 140° F., 145° F., 150° F., 160° F., 180° F., or 200° F., or higher, or between about 100-200° F., about 100-150° F., about 120-170° F., about 130-160° F., or about 130-150° F. In particular embodiments, the dehydration is performed under low heat at a temperature of less than about 125° F. The dehydration can be done for a period of time, for example, at least about 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, or longer. For example, dehydration can be done at a temperature of less than about 125° F. for about 10-12 hours, or until the desired water content is achieved. In some embodiments, the dehydration step can be carried out under oxygen-free conditions, for example, by exposing the de-beaned coffee cherries to an inert gas such as nitrogen during dehydration. In exemplary embodiments, the dehydration is carried out in two dehydration steps. For example, the first dehydration step (e.g., using a refrigerated air/condenser/dryer system under low heat or a stainless steel mesh belt dryer) reduces the water content of the de-beaned coffee cherries from about 85%-90% to about 10%, and the second dehydration step (e.g., using a finish dryer) further reduces the water content from about 10% to about 4% or less. The second dehydrator can optionally pasteurize the dehydrated coffee cherries using microwaves (approximately 1-2 or more hours using the methods disclosed herein). Alternatively, a centrifuge can be used to reduce the water content of the de-beaned coffee cherries. The de-beaned coffee cherries can be conveyed to the (first) dehydrator using a shaker/vibrator conveyor, or loaded directly into the dehydrator. Once dehydrated, the dried coffee fruit product is stored in a cool and dry place with no refrigeration required. The shelf-life of the dried coffee fruit is about 18 months when stored at ambient room temperature conditions. In certain embodiments, the de-beaned coffee cherries, with or without protective spray/refrigeration steps, are shredded to a size of from about 3 mm to about 10 mm using a shredding machine such as a “Toro Brand” leaf shredder or a mechanically similar machine such as a stainless steel “WATERFALL” shredder (COMMERCIAL brand model NS-26). The shredded coffee fruit can travel by air, gravity, and/or conveyors into a heated air cyclone to quickly pre-dry the coffee fruit to a moisture level of about 10% to about 15% from an initial moisture level of about 85% to about 90%. The coffee fruit can then travel to a second dehydrator (e.g., a finish dryer) that uses gas, solar, electricity, and/or microwaves for finish drying and pasteurizing. In some embodiments, the optional shredding step can be enhanced by reducing the surrounding oxygen by tenting the air intakes to the shredder and cyclone and replacing oxygen with nitrogen via a nitrogen generator. After dehydration of the de-beaned coffee cherries (e.g., after either the first or second dehydration step if two dehydration steps are used), the dried coffee fruit can be subjected to an optional enrichment step to fortify the dried fruit product with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds. This enrichment step can involve contacting the dehydrated coffee cherries with an enriching substance, such as a liquid coffee fruit extract prepared using the process disclosed herein. Such contacting can be carried out by, for example, spraying the dehydrated cherries with an aqueous or other extract. For example, when the de-beaned coffee cherries that are dehydrating have reached a moisture content of about 4%, the dehydrated coffee cherries can be sprayed with a liquid coffee fruit extract prepared as described herein or using methods known in the art, to enrich the dehydrated de-beaned coffee cherry product. In certain instances, the spray amount can be about 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more ounces of extract per kilogram of dehydrated coffee fruit. For example, the spray amount can be about 1 ounce of 40 Brix liquid coffee fruit extract for every kilogram of dried coffee fruit (based on about 4% moisture level). In certain embodiments, the dried coffee fruit is further processed to a powdered form after dehydration using any grinding or powder-creating machine known in the art such as a Fitzmill (e.g., Fitzmill DAS-06 available from IDEX MPT Inc.). In some instances, mesh screens of varying sizes (e.g., screen sizes #20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, etc.) are used to grind the dried coffee fruit into a powder and obtain particles of the desired size and uniformity. For example, the #40 screen size creates a powder with a medium particle size. In other instances, micro-grinding machines are used to finely grind the dried coffee fruit to the size of flour particles. The particles present in the coffee fruit powder typically have a median or mean particle size ranging from about 100 μm to about 500 μm, e.g., about 250 μm to about 500 μm, about 200 μm to about 425 μm, about 300 μm to about 500 μm, about 100 μm to about 300 μm, or about 100 μm, 150 μm, 200 μm, 250 μm, 300 μm, 350 μm, 400 μm, 450 μm, or 500 μm. In particular embodiments, the coffee fruit powder prepared from dried coffee fruit as described herein comprises a total phenolic acid concentration of from about 5% to about 25% (w/w), e.g., about 5% to about 20% (w/w), about 5% to about 15% (w/w), about 7% to about 15% (w/w), about 7% to about 12% (w/w), about 10% to about 25% (w/w), about 10% to about 20% (w/w), about 10% to about 15% (w/w), about 15% to about 25% (w/w), about 20% to about 25% (w/w), or about or at least about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, or 25% (w/w). In certain instances, the phenolic acids present in the coffee fruit powder include, but are not limited to, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, isoferulic acid, dihydroferulic acid, quinic acid, and combinations thereof. VI. Process for Preparing Powder from Coffee Fruit Extract In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a process for drying a liquid coffee fruit extract to produce a concentrated powder suitable for human consumption and other uses. In this process, coffee cherries are selected, de-beaned, and the antioxidants and other nutrients of the fruit are extracted according to the method described herein to product a liquid extract. The liquid extract can be concentrated to a Brix value of about 40, and then subjected to a drying process to prepare a concentrated powder. In some embodiments, the drying process is a spray dry process. In particular embodiments, the drying process is a pulse dry process. Other drying processes include, but are not limited to, vacuum microwave, freeze-drying, and air-drying methods. Pulse drying is a process that uses flash atomization to prepare dried powders with a speeding jet of hot gas. For example, the pulse drying process can comprise a rhythmic, pulsing action by a super-heated gas to produce particles with desired properties such as particle size, particle size distribution, and particle shape. When compared to spray dryers, pulse dryers dry the liquid of interest in a fraction of the time with significantly improved thermal efficiencies and with particle characteristics that cannot be achieved with spray dryers. Pulse drying systems generally include a drying chamber, cyclone, and bag housing, and are available from, e.g., Wave Dry (Corte Madera, Calif.). The process of drying the liquid extract described herein into a powder protects heat-sensitive nutrients present in the extract. The resulting powder is particularly advantageous over powders prepared from conventionally dried fruit because it is prepared using a concentrated liquid extract (e.g., about 40 Brix value) containing a higher level of beneficial compounds including antioxidants and polyphenols that are of interest in nutrition and human health. The finished product is stored in a cool and dry place, and requires no refrigeration. The powder form of the liquid extract typically contains at least about 5% (w/w) total phenolic acids. For example, the powder prepared by the process described herein can comprise a total phenolic acid concentration of from about 5% to about 50% (w/w), about 10% to about 50% (w/w), about 15% to about 50% (w/w), about 20% to about 50% (w/w), about 5% to about 40% (w/w), about 10% to about 40% (w/w), about 15% to about 40% (w/w), about 20% to about 40% (w/w), about 5% to about 30% (w/w), about 10% to about 30% (w/w), about 15% to about 30% (w/w), about 20% to about 30% (w/w), about 5% to about 25% (w/w), about 10% to about 25% (w/w), about 15% to about 25% (w/w), about 20% to about 25% (w/w), about 5% to about 20% (w/w), about 10% to about 20% (w/w), about 15% to about 20% (w/w), about 5% to about 15% (w/w), about 10% to about 15% (w/w), about 5% to about 10% (w/w), or about or at least about 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% (w/w). VII. Coffee Fruit Products and Compositions In certain aspects, the present invention provides coffee fruit products including liquid extracts, dried fruit, and powders prepared by the methods described herein. In certain other aspects, the present invention provides compositions including beverages, foods, neutraceuticals, and cosmetics comprising one or more of the coffee fruit products prepared by the methods described herein.

In certain instances, the coffee fruit powder is a super-concentrated dry product containing high levels of antioxidants prepared from the liquid coffee fruit extract described herein. In other instances, the coffee fruit powder is a fortified or enriched coffee fruit powder prepared by contacting (e.g., spraying) dried coffee fruit with the liquid coffee fruit extract prior to grinding dried coffee fruit into a powder. The compositions comprising one or more of the coffee fruit products described herein can be ingested or topically applied by a human and/or animal for nutritional, feed supplement, health-maintenance, health-improvement, and/or recreational purpose. Non-limiting examples of compositions for consumption include solid products (e.g., dietary supplements, snack bars, neutraceuticals, etc.) and liquid products (e.g., juices, sports drinks, carbonated beverages, teas, and other beverages, syrups, elixirs, etc.). Non-limiting examples of compositions for topical use include skin care products, anti-aging products, and other cosmetics. VIII. Examples The following examples are provided in order to better enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the disclosed compositions and methods, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Example 1 Preparation of Coffee Fruit Extract After removal of the coffee bean, the remaining coffee fruit (skin, pulp, and mucilage) retains many nourishing compounds including antioxidants, polyphenols, phytochemicals, vitamins, etc. that are of interest in nutrition and human health. The following example provides a process for extracting and concentrating the nutrients of the coffee fruit to produce a liquid extract suitable for human consumption and other uses. Selection of Desirable Coffee Cherries The process begins with whole coffee cherries that are washed and “floated.” Undesirable cherries, such as overripe and underdeveloped coffee cherries float, whereas ripe and desirable coffee cherries do not. Thus, “floating” plus visual inspection allow for the easy removal of undesirable cherries. Pulping Coffee Cherry and Preparing Fruit for Extraction After selection of ripe coffee cherries, the cherries are then de-seeded (pulped). The remaining coffee fruits (skin, pulp, and mucilage) are transported a short distance (within 100 yards of the pulping area) via a PVC pipe (or similar rapid food-safe transport) using clean filtered water as a transport medium. Optionally, after de-seeding the pulped cherries (coffee fruits) can be sprayed with a mist comprising or consisting of a mixture of ascorbic acid and citric acid in water. For example, the aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and citric acid can be prepared by mixing ½ cup ascorbic acid and ¼ cup citric acid per gallon of water. Generally, the mist is applied to the coffee fruits as they leave the pulping machine. Without being bound by any particular theory, the inclusion of this step slows the oxidation (browning) of the coffee fruits, thereby extending the working time of the coffee fruits before the fruits degrade. Once the cherries are pulped and transferred, a press/extruder is used to remove the excess water on the coffee fruits that was introduced during the transport from the pulper area to the press/extruder area. Optionally, excess water is removed by using a vibration screen or centrifuge. All excess water can be collected and pumped back to the pulping area for reuse. Next, the coffee fruits are immediately bagged into food-safe poly bags and sealed. Oxygen is removed from the bags using a vacuum pump since any remaining oxygen in the bags can react with the coffee fruits to degrade the desirable antioxidants. The sealed vacuumed bags are immediately placed at −30° Fahrenheit (F) for about 24 hours to irreversibly denature enzymes that degrade the coffee fruits. Extracting Coffee Fruit Nutrients Frozen coffee fruits are slowly brought from −30° F. to +30° F. in a controlled temperature room overnight. Coffee fruits at +30° F. are further thawed by adding them to 180° F. filtered hot water. Once added to the hot water, the coffee fruits are mixed, agitated, or macerated (chopped or ground into small pieces) in the hot water. Optionally, the hot water is de-ionized. Without being bound by any particular theory, the large change in temperature when the coffee fruits are added to the hot water causes the cells of the coffee fruit to “burst,” releasing the nutrients from inside the cells. The step of mixing, agitating, or macerating the coffee fruits in the hot water aids in the extraction process, particularly the macerating step, which allows more contact of the coffee fruit surface with the water. Macerating can be achieved by a number of machines including a grinder-pump or a sheer-pump. The coffee fruits are incubated and the nutrients are extracted in the hot water with mixing, agitation, or maceration for about 20-40 minutes. After extraction of the nutrients, the resulting “Tea” and saturated fruit (skins and pulp) are transferred from the extraction tanks to a press/extruder to remove all remaining “Tea” from the saturated skins and pulp. The resulting “Tea” is next filtered through a fine screen to remove the pulp and skin pieces. Evaporating and Concentrating Coffee Fruit Nutrients The isolated “Tea” is collected in a food-safe liquid tote (IBC) and is held for a minimum of 1 hour. The 1 hour incubation allows any sediment/pulp to separate by gravity. Any sediment that collects is removed. At this point the “Tea” contains a measurable refractive index between 3.5 and 5 Brix. Concentration of the “Tea” is achieved at low temperatures (e.g., under 100° F.) using a vacuum concentrator which allows the “Tea” to boil at close to room temperature. The vacuum concentrator evaporates the “Tea” until the Brix Measurement reaches 20. After reaching a higher concentration, a second gravity sedimentation step is included to remove any additional pulp or skin. After about 12 hours any sediment that collects is removed and the vacuum concentration process continues until the measured concentration reaches 40 Brix, the desired finished value. Finally, a third gravity sedimentation step is performed, and sediment is removed. Optionally, the 40 Brix concentrated “Tea” can be pasteurized by transferring the “Tea” to a pasteurizing machine where the “Tea” is very quickly heated and cooled. Once concentration, final gravity sedimentation, and optional pasteurization is complete, the “Tea” is placed into new sterile food-safe IBC totes and stored in cool and dry conditions. The finished product needs no refrigeration.

The following example provides a process for drying the coffee fruit to produce dried skins and powders suitable for human consumption and other uses. Selection of Desirable Coffee Cherries The process begins with whole coffee cherries that are washed and “floated.” Undesirable cherries, such as overripe and underdeveloped coffee cherries float, whereas ripe and desirable coffee cherries do not. Thus, “floating” plus visual inspection allow for the easy removal of undesirable cherries. Pulping Coffee Cherry and Preparing Fruit for Drying After selection of ripe coffee cherries, the cherries are then de-seeded (pulped). The remaining coffee fruits (skin, pulp, and mucilage) are transported a short distance (within 100 yards of the pulping area) via a PVC pipe (or similar rapid food-safe transport) using clean filtered water as a transport medium. Optionally, after de-seeding the pulped cherries (coffee fruits) can be sprayed with a mist comprising or consisting of a mixture of ascorbic acid and citric acid in water.

Optionally, excess water is removed by using a vibration screen or centrifuge. All excess water can be collected and pumped back to the pulping area for reuse. After removing excess water, the coffee fruits are immediately sent (e.g., via a stainless steel auger or a food safe conveyor) to a dehydration machine. Optionally, before further processing, the coffee fruits can be preserved for later processing by immediately bagging into food-safe poly bags, sealing, vacuuming, and freezing at −30° F. Vacuuming removes the remaining oxygen in the sealed bags, which can react with the fruits to degrade the desirable antioxidants. Freezing the bags at −30° F. for about 24 hours may irreversibly denature enzymes that degrade the coffee fruit. Frozen coffee fruits can be slowly brought from −30° F. to +30° F. in a controlled temperature room overnight. Drying Coffee Cherries The coffee fruits can be dried in a dehydration machine that uses a refrigerated air/condenser/dryer system which allows for drying of the fruit using low heat (under 125° F.), retaining the nutrients of the coffee fruits. The dehydration machine is used to dry the coffee fruit from about 85% moisture level to about 10% moisture level. Once at about 10% moisture level, the coffee fruits are transferred to a finish dryer which pasteurizes the fruits using microwaves and dries them from about 10% moisture level to the desired moisture level, usually from about 2% to about 4%. Typically, this drying process can produce about 250 kg of finished product per day. Alternatively, a stainless steel mesh belt dryer is used in place of a dehydration machine to dry the coffee fruit from about 85% moisture level to about 10% moisture level. Once at about 10% moisture level, the coffee fruits are transferred to a finish dryer which pasteurizes the fruits using microwaves and dries them from about 10% moisture level to the desired moisture level, usually from about 2% to about 4%. Typically, this drying process can produce over 1 ton of finished product per day. After completing the drying process, the dried fruits are now transferred to a batch tank where they rest until they are used as dried skins or ground into a powder, depending on the preference of the consumer. The finished product is stored in a cool and dry place, and requires no refrigeration.

A liquid coffee fruit extract prepared according to Example 1 can be dried to a powder by a pulse dry process. This process spray dries the extract and protects heat-sensitive nutrients present in the extract. The resulting product is particularly advantageous over powders prepared from conventionally dried skins because it is prepared using a concentrated liquid extract (e.g., 40 Brix value) containing a higher concentration of compounds including antioxidants and polyphenols that are of interest in nutrition and human health. The finished product is stored in a cool and dry place, and requires no refrigeration. Example 4 Properties of Coffee Fruit Powder The following example illustrates some of the numerous advantageous properties exhibited by the dried coffee fruit powder prepared according to the method described herein. Cell Viability Assay The cell viability assay (CVA) is based on a proliferation assay that determines the effect of the powder of the present invention on cell growth and cell viability. The assay result is expressed as the maximum concentration of powder present in cell culture that promotes cell viability using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a marker for metabolically active cells. Effective Concentration CVA Result 1321.25 μg/ml Cellular Anti-Inflammatory Assay The cellular anti-inflammatory assay (NFκB) determines the inhibition potential of the powder of the present invention on expression/production level of NFκB in human cells. NFκB serves as a biomarker for inflammation. In particular, this assay determines the anti-inflammatory potential of the powder in human cells. NFκB (Nuclear Factor kappa B), a protein complex that is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress and free radicals, is used as inflammation biomarker. In this assay, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine, is introduced to the human cells to trigger cellular inflammation. If an anti-inflammatory material is presented in the cellular environment, the material inhibits NFκB activation and the degree of inhibition can be monitored via NFκB expression. The NFκB expression level of the human cells, treated with and without the powder of the present invention, under the stressed condition are therefore monitored and compared. Maximum percentage of NFκB expression inhibition induced by the powder is shown in the table below. The concentration used that induced the maximum inhibition of NFκB expression is also shown. Inducer/ Maximum Effective Stressor inhibition Concentration NFκB Assay TNF-α 67.01% 1321.25 Result μg/ml Cellular Antioxidant Assay The cellular antioxidant assay (CAA) analyzes the capacity of the powder of the present invention to protect a fluorescent probe (as a marker) from damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an intracellular environment. In this assay, a peroxyl radical is used as the ROS, and human liver cells are used as the cellular model. Quercetin is used as the standard, and the results are expressed as μmole quercetin equivalency (μmole QE) per gram (or milliliter) of the powder. Effective Concentration CAA Result 431.82 μmole QE/gram IX.

No. 15/922,774, filed Mar. 15, 2018, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable BACKGROUND Many people enjoy drinking coffee as part of a daily routine. However, preparing coffee is time-consuming and can be an inefficient use of time and energy (including electrical energy) when only a single cup is to be prepared. Meanwhile, coffee makers that are designed to prepare a single cup of coffee using a single-serve ground coffee container (e.g. a Keurig® K-Cup® pod) produce an enormous amount of waste that is harmful to the environment. The result of single use K-Cup type pods is that the planet is literally being destroyed. Tens of billions of pods end up in landfills annually. If the discarded pods are placed end-to-end, they would circle the globe 12 times! This means that the waste problem is growing and will grow as more companies and unless mitigated will continue to cause problems exponentially for our planet. BRIEF SUMMARY The present disclosure contemplates various systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee. An amount of liquid coffee concentrate to prepare an individual serving of coffee is packaged in a sealed container. Unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods, the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate does not need to contain a filter since the process of preparing coffee from a liquid coffee concentrate involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds. Due to the absence of a filter and the concentrated nature of liquid coffee concentrate, the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate can be very small, for example, sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. A single sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate can be used to prepare a serving of coffee using an existing coffee maker (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker) designed for single-serve ground coffee containers (e.g. Keurig® K-Cup® pods). An adapter may be provided for receiving the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate and positioning the sealed container in the coffee maker. When the coffee maker is operated, an upper portion of the sealed container may be pierced by a needle of the coffee maker to allow heated water to flow into the sealed container. A lower portion of the sealed container may be pierced by a needle of the adapter or may be otherwise compromised to allow the combined liquid coffee concentrate and hot water to flow out of the sealed container and into a user's coffee cup. In accordance with one embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. The system includes a sealed container containing an amount of liquid coffee concentrate for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee and a coffee maker operable to prepare a single serving of coffee from the liquid coffee concentrate contained in the sealed container. The coffee maker includes a coffee maker recess for receiving the sealed container, a first coffee maker needle for piercing an entrance hole in an upper portion of the sealed container while the sealed container is in the coffee maker recess, a water conduit by which water from a water source flows into the sealed container through the entrance hole, and a heater for heating the water.

The adapter may include an adapter needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed container when the sealed container is pressed into the adapter recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed container. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the exit hole. The sealed container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by the heater. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The coffee maker may include a second coffee maker needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed container when the sealed container is pressed into the coffee maker recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed container. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the exit hole. The sealed container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed container may be have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. In accordance with another embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate and a coffee maker having a coffee maker recess for receiving a single-serve ground coffee container. The system includes a sealed container containing an amount of liquid coffee concentrate for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, and an adapter for receiving the sealed container and positioning the sealed container in the coffee maker recess. The adapter includes an upper portion having an adapter recess for receiving the sealed container, and an exterior sized to fit the coffee maker recess. The adapter may include an adapter needle for piercing an exit hole in a lower portion of the sealed container when the sealed container is pressed into the adapter recess by operation of a lid of the coffee maker being closed down on the sealed container. A combination of the liquid coffee concentrate and water from the coffee maker may flow out of the sealed container through the exit hole. The sealed container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by a heater of the coffee maker. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The sealed container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed container may have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. In accordance with another embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. The system includes a sealed container, and liquid coffee concentrate inside the sealed container in an amount for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee. The sealed container may include a shell having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and a coating that covers the one or more holes and melts when contacted by water that has been heated by a heater of a coffee maker. A combination of the water and the liquid coffee concentrate may flow out of the sealed container through the one or more holes. The shell may be made from a durable paper and the coating may be made from a waterproof wax, plastic, or parchment. The sealed container may contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. The sealed container may have an exterior volume of less than 25 mL. Another aspect of the present disclosure contemplates systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a formed (e.g. molded or otherwise given some shape on a scale larger than a particle or granule) soluble coffee product. A formed soluble coffee product is prepared in the shape of a wafer, ball, or other shape, including an amount of soluble coffee (i.e. instant coffee) to prepare an individual serving of coffee. The formed soluble coffee product is placed in a container having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, and the container is placed in a coffee maker, such as an existing coffee maker (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker) designed for single-serve ground coffee containers (e.g. Keurig® K-Cup® pods). A cap with an orifice may be provided that fits on the container. When the coffee maker is operated, the orifice in the cap may receive a needle of the coffee maker to allow heated water to flow into the container. As the heated water dissolves the formed soluble coffee product, the combined soluble coffee and hot water may flow out of the container via the one or more holes and into a user's coffee cup. The process of preparing coffee from the formed soluble coffee product involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds, and the container need not be pierced by a needle or otherwise compromised when dissolving the formed soluble coffee product. Therefore, the process produces no waste. Moreover, unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods, the container holding the formed soluble coffee product does not need to contain a filter (since the process of preparing coffee from soluble coffee involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds). Due to the absence of a filter and the concentrated nature of soluble coffee, the container can be sized to receive more than one formed soluble coffee products and/or formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products, allowing the user to mix and match to suit his/her taste and desired coffee strength. According to one embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee. The system includes one or more formed soluble coffee products and a container having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, the one or more holes sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble coffee products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the container. The system may further include a coffee maker operable to prepare a single serving of coffee from the one or more formed soluble coffee products, the coffee maker including a recess for receiving the container, a water conduit by which water from a water source flows into the container while the container is in the recess, and a heater for heating the water. Each of the formed soluble coffee products may have one or more protrusions arranged to produce a gap between adjacent formed soluble coffee products when at least two of the one or more formed soluble coffee products are stacked in the container. Each of the one or more formed soluble coffee products may have a dimension that completely covers the one or more holes when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the container. The container may include one or more stoppers that extend laterally outward from the container in an upper portion thereof, the one or more stoppers preventing the container from falling into the recess of the coffee maker. The recess of the coffee maker may include an exit needle positioned to pierce single-serve ground coffee container when a single-serve ground coffee container is placed in the coffee maker, and the one or more stoppers may prevent the container from being pierced by the exit needle. The system may include a lid that fits on the container and includes an orifice. The water conduit of the coffee maker may include an entrance needle that fits into the orifice of the cap. The system may include one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products. The one or more holes of the container may be sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products are placed in the container. According to another embodiment, there is a method of preparing an individual serving of coffee. The method includes placing one or more formed soluble coffee products in a container having one or more holes in a lower portion thereof, the one or more holes sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble coffee products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the container. The method may further include placing the container in a recess of a coffee maker and operating the coffee maker to cause hot water to flow into the container until the one or more formed soluble coffee products are completely dissolved. Placing one or more formed soluble coffee products in the container may include stacking at least two of the one or more formed soluble coffee products in the container. Each of the formed soluble coffee products may have one or more protrusions arranged to produce a gap between adjacent formed soluble coffee products when the at least two formed soluble coffee products are stacked in the container. Each of the one or more formed soluble coffee products may have a dimension that completely covers the one or more holes when the one or more formed soluble coffee products are placed in the container. The container may include one or more stoppers that extend laterally outward from the container in an upper portion thereof, the one or more stoppers preventing the container from falling into the recess of the coffee maker. The method may include fitting a cap on the container, the cap including an orifice, and inserting an entrance needle of the coffee maker into the orifice of the cap. Operating the coffee maker may cause the hot water to flow into the container via the entrance needle. The method may include dipping at least one of the one or more formed soluble coffee products in a flavor or creamer additive. The method may include placing one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products in the container. The one or more holes of the container may be sized to prevent the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products from passing therethrough when the one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products are placed in the container. According to another embodiment, there is a method of manufacturing a formed soluble coffee product. The method includes pouring coffee into a mold, pouring a flavor or creamer additive into the mold, and freeze drying the combined coffee and additive while the coffee and additive are in the mold. The method may include brewing the coffee from ground coffee beans. The method may include grinding roasted coffee beans to produce the ground coffee beans. The method may include roasting coffee beans to produce the roasted coffee beans. The coffee may be a liquid coffee concentrate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure encompasses various embodiments of systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. A person wishing to make a single serving of coffee takes a sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and places it in a coffee maker 50 . The sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 may be very small (e.g. sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate) in comparison to single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules. The coffee maker 50 may be a Keurig®, Nespresso® or other coffee maker that is designed to be used with single-serve ground coffee containers. The sealed container 10 may be placed inside an adapter 30 that positions the sealed container 10 in the coffee maker 50 . The person then closes the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 down on the sealed container 10 , causing a needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to puncture an upper portion of the sealed container 10 and allowing heated water to flow into the sealed container 10 through the puncture hole. A needle 38 of the adapter 30 may puncture a bottom portion of the sealed container 10 , or the sealed container 10 A may be designed to burst open in the bottom portion when filled with hot water, allowing the combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to flow down into the person's coffee cup. Afterward, the sealed container 10 , which is now punctured or otherwise compromised, may be thrown away or recycled, depending on its material composition. In either case, little waste is produced because the sealed container 10 needs no internal filter and may contain only the liquid coffee concentrate, making it much smaller than a single-serve ground coffee container such as a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or a Nespresso® capsule. FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 2 are a perspective view, a side view, and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of a sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and an adapter 30 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The sealed container 10 may contain an amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, e.g. 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The sealed container 10 may have a generally cylindrical body 12 as shown with a protruding cap 14 that extends laterally outward relative to the body 12 (e.g. by 2-10 mm). When the sealed container 10 is inserted into the adapter 30 , the body 12 may fit inside a recess 32 of the adapter 30 while the protruding cap 14 does not fit inside the recess 32 . In this way, the protruding cap 14 may prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 and may provide a convenient handhold for a person removing the sealed container 10 after it has been used. The sealed container 10 may be made of a recyclable or biodegradable material or combination of materials. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the sealed container 10 may include an exterior shell 16 made of a durable paper (e.g. lightweight cardboard) that is coated with an interior coating 18 such as a waterproof wax (e.g. paraffin wax), plastic (e.g. polyethylene), or parchment. For example, the body 12 and protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 may be cut, rolled, and/or folded from a sheet of the exterior shell 16 and interior coating 18 materials. The durable paper may be durable enough to allow the exterior shell 16 to maintain its form while being handled in the ordinary usage of the sealed container 10 . The body 12 and the protruding cap 14 may both include a portion of the exterior shell 16 and a portion of the interior coating 18 . The interior coating 18 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from degrading the exterior shell 16 , thus allowing the exterior shell 16 to be made from a durable paper such as cardboard. In some cases, the interior coating 18 may not be as recyclable or biodegradable as the exterior shell 16 and may instead melt off the exterior shell 16 and into the coffee as the coffee is prepared from hot water mixing with the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . In such cases, the interior coating 18 may be made of a material that is harmless when ingested and does not appreciably affect the taste of the coffee. As noted above, the sealed container 10 may contain, for example, 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The overall capacity of the sealed container 10 may be equal to the amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 contained in the sealed container 10 , or may be greater, with the remaining space filled with a quantity of air. The capacity of the sealed container 10 may range from the minimum capacity needed to contain the desired amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 (e.g. 5 mL, but may be lower depending on the concentration of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and the desired strength of the coffee) up to a maximum capacity depending on the size of the coffee maker that the sealed container 10 will be used with. For example, if the sealed container 10 will be inserted in an adapter 30 inside a Keurig® coffee maker, a relatively large sealed container 10 may have a capacity of around 40 mL. In the interest of minimizing the size of the sealed container 10 , the capacity of the sealed container 10 may be less than 20 mL, preferably less than 15 mL, more preferably less than 10 mL. Accounting for the material(s) of the sealed container 10 itself, the sealed container 10 may have an exterior volume that is slightly greater than its capacity, where the exterior volume is defined as the total volume of liquid displaced when the sealed container 10 is submerged in the liquid. Such exterior volume may similarly range between low values around 5 mL and relatively high values around 40 mL, with the exterior volume greater than the capacity of the sealed container 10 by an amount defined by the volume displaced by the material(s) of the sealed container 10 . For example, assuming the material(s) of the sealed container 10 displace 5 mL, the exterior volume of the sealed container 10 may be less than 25 mL, preferably less than 20 mL, more preferably less than 15 mL. The recess 32 of the adapter 30 may be generally cylindrical to match the shape of the sealed container 10 and may be wider (e.g. having a greater diameter) than the sealed container 10 , except that the recess 32 may be narrower (e.g. having a smaller diameter) than the protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 . In this way, the recess 32 may be shaped to prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the adapter 30 and becoming irretrievable. The exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped to fit inside an existing coffee maker in the same way that a single-serve ground coffee container fits inside the coffee maker. Thus, for example, the exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod, a Nespresso® capsule, etc., depending on which existing coffee maker the adapter 30 is designed for. It is also contemplated that the adapter 30 may be designed to universally match two or more such existing coffee makers (e.g. by matching a height dimension of one and a width dimension of another). In some cases, an existing coffee maker may have a needle positioned to pierce a lower portion of a single-serve ground coffee container. For example, a Keurig® coffee maker may have a part known as a K-Cup® holder that functions as a recess for receiving a K-Cup® pod, and the K-Cup® holder may have a part known as an exit needle that is positioned to pierce the bottom of the K-Cup® pod at a peripheral region of the K-Cup® pod. The adapter 30 may be shaped so as to avoid touching or pressing hard against such needle as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. In this regard, the adapter 30 may have a reduced height relative to the recess of the coffee maker, so as not to extend deeply enough into the recess to reach the needle, or the adapter 30 may have an exterior contour with a sloped or stepped region 34 in a lower portion thereof that slopes or steps inward to avoid the needle. Such reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 34 may symmetrically define the exterior of the adapter 30 or may occur only in a portion of the adapter 30 , e.g. as a dedicated slot to receive the needle. Meanwhile, the upper portion of the adapter 30 may have an outwardly extending lip 36 that extends laterally outward from the recess 32 in the upper portion of the adapter 30 . In this way, just as the protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 may prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the lip 36 of the adapter may prevent the adapter 30 from being inserted too far into the recess of the coffee maker. By holding the adapter 30 at the top of the recess of the coffee maker, the lip 36 may allow the adapter 30 to avoid the needle of the coffee maker. As shown in FIG. 2, the interior of the adapter 30 may include a hollow adapter needle 38 that acts as a fluid conduit between the recess 32 of the adapter 30 and the bottom of the adapter 30 . The adapter needle 38 may have a sharp point at the top and be positioned to puncture the bottom portion of the sealed container 10 when the sealed container 10 is pressed down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . The adapter 30 may be made of a hard plastic such as polypropylene and may be manufactured by injection molding, with the adapter needle 38 made of a metal alloy such as stainless steel or carbon steel. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the sealed container 10 and the adapter 30 with the sealed container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 . As shown in FIG. 3, the sealed container 10 may fit snugly in the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , with the recess 32 of the adapter 30 slightly larger than the sealed container 10 . In the case of a cylindrical sealed container 10 and a cylindrical recess 32 , the recess 32 may have an inner diameter that is slightly greater (e.g. 2-10 mm) than the exterior diameter of the sealed container 10 . When the sealed container 10 is placed inside the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the sealed container 10 may initially come to rest on top of the adapter needle 38 without being punctured. In this way, the sealed container 10 may be positioned in the adapter 30 (before or after the adapter is placed inside the coffee maker) without prematurely releasing the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from the sealed container 10 . FIGS. 4A and 4B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of the sealed container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 with the adapter 30 placed inside the coffee maker 50 , with FIG. 4A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 4B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. In FIG. 4A, the sealed container 10 is resting on top of the adapter needle 38 as in FIG. 3. Meanwhile, the entire adapter 30 is positioned inside a recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The illustrated recess 52 is a K-Cup® holder as used in Keurig® coffee makers, including an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) and a funnel part 56 . As can be seen, the adapter 30 is positioned in the recess 52 so as to avoid an exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . In the example of FIGS. 4A and 4B, the full height of the adapter 30 is great enough to extend down past the tip of the exit needle 55 while the lip 36 of the adapter 30 rests on the outside of the recess 52 . In this example, the adapter 30 can still avoid the exit needle 55 due to its exterior contour having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as shown. In addition to the recess 52 (having the exit needle part 54 and the funnel part 56 ), the coffee maker 50 shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B has a lid 58 (see FIG. 4B), a water conduit 60 , a pump 62 , and a heater 64 . The water conduit 60 provides water for making a cup of coffee. For example, water from a water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed container 10 as described in more detail below. The water source 61 may be, for example, a fillable water tank of the coffee maker 60 . The pump 62 may pump the water from the water source 61 to the sealed container 10 via the water conduit 60 , and the heater 64 may heat the water. For example, the heater 64 may heat the water while the water is at the water source 61 (e.g. in a water tank) or while the water is en route to the sealed container 10 (e.g. as the water flows through piping or tubing or one or more heating tanks of the water conduit 60 ). Thus, the heater 64 may heat only the amount of water needed for an individual cup of coffee or may heat a larger batch of water. The heater 64 may be an electric heater that heats the water by Joule heating. It is also contemplated that the water source 61 may be a connection to a cold water line of a building, similar to that used by a refrigerator that has a water dispenser or ice maker. In this case, the pump 62 may be omitted as the pressure in the water line is used to bring the water to the sealed container 10 via the water conduit 60 . The lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 has an entrance needle 66 for piercing a hole in an upper portion of the sealed container 10 while the sealed container 10 is in the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The entrance needle 66 may be hollow and act as a part of the water conduit 60 (e.g. with an upper end of the entrance needle 66 connected to tubing or piping of the water conduit 60 ). In this way, the water from the water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed container 10 through the tip of the entrance needle 66 after the entrance needle 66 punctures the hole in the sealed container 10 . To this end, the entrance needle 66 may have a sharp point at the bottom and be positioned to puncture the top portion of the sealed container 10 when the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed container 10 sitting into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . As the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed container 10 , a bottom face 68 of the lid 58 may abut against the sealed container 10 to press the sealed container 10 down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . In this way, the action of the lid 58 may, in addition to causing the entrance needle 66 to pierce the upper portion of the sealed container 10 , cause the sealed container 10 to press against the tip of the adapter needle 38 so that the adapter needle 38 punctures the lower portion of the sealed container 10 . The adapter needle 38 may have an internal passage 40 with an inlet 42 near the point of the adapter needle 38 where the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed container 10 and an outlet 44 at the bottom of the adapter 30 . When the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed container 10 , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 42 , through the internal passage 40 , and out of the outlet 44 and into the person's coffee cup where additional mixing of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may occur. Just below the inlet 42 , a gasket 46 may be provided to function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may be angled upward so as to function as a funnel that directs any fluid leaving through the puncture hole into the inlet 42 of the internal passage 40 of the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may also function as a seal against the sealed container 10 . For example, the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the height of the sealed container 10 below the protruding cap 14 matches the depth of the gasket 46 within the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . More specifically, the gasket 46 may be made of a flexible material (e.g. rubber) that is capable of bending downward as the sealed container 10 presses down on it, so as to remain in contact with the sealed container 10 for a range of depths (spanning 1-5 mm, for example). The sealed container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the bottom of the sealed container 10 falls within this range of depths when the protruding cap 14 rests on the adapter 30 outside the recess 32 . In this way, it may be assured that the bottom of the sealed container 10 presses against the gasket 46 , with the gasket 46 functioning as a seal between the adapter needle 38 and the sealed container 10 . The gasket 46 may thus prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 and gasket 46 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 5A and 5B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 a placed inside an adapter 30 a with the adapter 30 a placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 5A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 5B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 5A and 5B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 a and adapter 30 a . The sealed container 10 a may be the same as the sealed container 10 except that the exterior shell 16 a of the sealed container 10 a includes one or more holes 17 in a lower portion thereof, with the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 . The one or more holes 17 may be used to allow a mixture of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to burst out from the sealed container 10 when preparing a serving of coffee. To this end, the adapter 30 a may be the same as the adapter 30 except that the adapter 30 a omits the adapter needle 38 , including, in its place, a borehole 38 a extending from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a to the bottom of the adapter 30 a . The borehole 38 a may be present in the adapter 30 as well, with the only difference being the presence of the adapter needle 38 filling the borehole 38 a in the adapter 30 . As described above, water from the water source 61 may be pressurized by the pump 62 and heated by the heater 64 as it flows through the water conduit 60 . When the heated and pressurized water flows from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 a , the added heat and/or pressure of the water shooting into the sealed container 10 a and against the bottom of the sealed container 10 a may melt or otherwise degrade the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 , allowing the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow out of the sealed container 10 a through the one or more holes 17 . Along the same lines, instead of the one or more holes 17 , the exterior shell 16 a may have a kiss cut or other perforation or weakening in the lower portion thereof (preferably bottom exterior side), in the shape of a starburst for example. In this case, the pressure of the water shooting into the sealed container 10 a may blow out the exterior shell 16 a itself, rather than only the interior coating 18 . In either case, the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may then flow through the borehole 38 a of the adapter 30 a and down into the person's coffee cup. It should be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to burst through the interior coating 18 and/or exterior shell 16 a of the sealed container 10 a should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . In the case of the sealed container 10 a and adapter 30 a , there is no adapter needle 38 that punctures the bottom of the sealed container 10 a . Therefore, there is no danger of premature puncturing by the adapter needle 38 , and the sealed container 10 a may be completely inserted into the adapter 30 a at an initial stage as shown in FIG. 5A without needing to be pressed farther into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a by the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 . That is, the sealed container 10 a may always come to rest with the protruding cap 14 against the top of the adapter 30 a (preventing the sealed container 10 a from falling too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a ) as shown in FIG. 5A, never in an elevated position resting on the adapter needle 38 as in the case of the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 as shown in FIG. 4A. FIGS. 6A and 6B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 b placed inside an adapter 30 b with the adapter 30 b placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 6A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 6B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 6A and 6B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 b and adapter 30 b . The sealed container 10 b may be the same as the sealed container 10 except that, unlike the body 12 of the sealed container 10 , the body 12 b of the sealed container 10 b has a rounded bottom 13 b . In other respects, the body 12 b may be the same as the body 12 and may be, for example, generally cylindrical like the body 12 . The rounded bottom 13 b may advantageously act as a funnel within the sealed container 10 b , aiding the flow of all of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water contained in the sealed container 10 b to the same part of the sealed container 10 b for efficient flow out of the sealed container 10 b . For example, if the adapter needle 38 is positioned to puncture the center of the sealed container 10 b , the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed container 10 b to a point at the center of the sealed container 10 b where a hole is punctured by the adapter needle 38 . Similarly, in a case where there is no adapter needle 38 and the sealed container 10 b has holes 17 or other burst-through mechanism like the sealed container 10 a of FIGS. 5A and 5B, the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed container 10 b to the vicinity of the one or more holes 17 or other mechanism. The rounded bottom 13 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed container 10 b , e.g., as it may be produced from a single sheet of material. The rounded bottom 13 b may be half-spherical or exhibit any other curvature. The rounded bottom 13 b may include portions that are not curved, such as a central flat portion allowing the sealed container 10 b to be placed upright without falling over. The sealed container 10 b may also differ from the sealed container 10 in that the sealed container 10 b may have a protruding film 14 b in place of the protruding cap 14 . The protruding film 14 b may be made of an easily puncturable material such as aluminum foil or a laminate of aluminum foil and paper or plastic, which may cause the entrance needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to degrade less quickly as it is repeatedly used to pierce sealed containers 10 b . The protruding film 14 b may obviate the need for the interior coating 18 to extend beyond the body 12 b (e.g. to the protruding cap 14 described above), as the protruding film 14 b itself may be made of a material that is resistant to degradation caused by the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The protruding film 14 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed container 10 b , e.g. as the protruding film 14 b may be produced as a single sheet and without folded portions. The adapter 30 b may be the same as the adapter 30 or the adapter 30 a . The adapter 30 b shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B differs from the adapter 30 and 30 a to illustrate some modifications in design that may be applied to any of the adapters 30 , 30 a , 30 b . For example, the adapter 30 b has an annular depression 31 around the recess 32 in place of a sloping region of the adapters 30 and 30 a . The depression 31 is especially useful in the case of the sealed container 10 b because the protruding film 14 b may have much less height than the protruding cap 14 . Without the depression 31 , it might be difficult to retrieve the sealed container 10 b from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 b after use, since the protruding film 14 b might be almost flush against the top of the adapter 30 b . The depression 31 provides a place for a person's finger to go when grabbing the sealed container 10 b , making retrieval of the sealed container 10 b from the adapter 30 b easier. The adapter 30 b also illustrates an example in which the overall reduced height of the adapter 30 b relative to the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 , rather than the exterior contour of the adapter 30 b having a sloped or stepped region 34 , may be used to avoid the exit needle 55 of the coffee maker 50 . FIGS. 7A and 7B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 c placed inside an adapter 30 c with the adapter 30 c placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 7A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 7B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 7A and 7B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c . The sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be the same as the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 a except that, as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be shaped to take advantage of the existing exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 . As such, rather than having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the exterior contour of the adapter 30 c may remain wide enough in the vicinity of the exit needle 55 so as to allow the exit needle 55 to extend into a borehole 38 c of the adapter 30 c . In this regard, the borehole 38 c may be structurally the same as the borehole 38 a described in relation to FIGS. 5A and 5B, with the difference being its positioning in relation to the exit needle 55 . With the borehole 38 c positioned to correspond to the exit needle 55 , which is off-center, the recess 32 c may similarly be provided off-center in the adapter 30 c . More particularly, the recess 32 c may have a shape that is off-center toward the bottom while being centered in the adapter 30 c toward the top. As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, for example, the recess 32 c may have a generally upside-down L-shaped profile that diminishes in cross-sectional area from the top to the bottom of the adapter 30 c . By providing such an adapter 30 c , a correspondingly shaped sealed container 10 c may be placed in the recess 32 c such that the top of the sealed container 10 c may be punctured by a central entrance needle 66 and the bottom of the sealed container 10 c may be punctured by an off-center exit needle 55 . In this way, both the needles 66 , 55 of the existing coffee maker 50 may be used and the adapter needle 38 is not required. Heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 c through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed container 10 c through the exit needle 55 and down into the person's coffee cup. More specifically, the exit needle 55 may have an internal passage 70 with an inlet 72 near the point of the exit needle 55 where the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed container 10 c and an outlet 74 that feeds into the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 . When the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed container 10 c , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 72 , through the internal passage 70 , and out of the outlet 74 . Just below the inlet 72 , a gasket 76 may be provided to function as a seal around the exit needle 55 in the same way that the gasket 46 may function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 8A and 8B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 d including cross-sectional views of the sealed container 10 of FIGS. 1-4B placed inside the coffee maker 50 d without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 8A showing the coffee maker 50 d in an open position and FIG. 8B showing the coffee maker 50 d in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 d may differ from the coffee maker 50 described above in that the coffee maker 50 d may be specifically designed for use with the sealed container 10 , i.e. with no adapter 30 necessary. In this regard, the coffee maker 50 d may be the same as the coffee maker 50 in all respects except for the recess 52 . Whereas the recess 52 includes an exit needle part 54 with an off-center exit needle 55 , the recess 52 d of FIGS. 8A and 8B includes an exit needle part 54 d with an exit needle 55 d that is located in the center. The recess 52 d may further include a funnel part 56 d that is the same as the funnel part 56 except that it is designed to align with the centered exit needle 55 d of the exit needle part 54 d rather than the off-center exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . The recess 52 d may further differ from the recess 52 in that it may have a generally smaller interior than the recess 52 of an existing coffee maker 50 (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker). This is because, as described above, the sealed container 10 may be significantly smaller than a single-serve ground coffee container like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod. In use, heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed container 10 through the exit needle 55 d and down into the person's coffee cup. Alternatively, the coffee maker 50 d may omit the exit needle 55 d , having only a borehole similar to the borehole 38 a but extending downward from the recess 52 d of the coffee maker 55 d rather than from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a . Such a modified coffee maker 55 d could be used with the sealed container 10 a having the one or more holes 17 . The combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may burst from the sealed container 10 as the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 melts (or as the sealed container 10 itself bursts open as described above), thereafter flowing down through the borehole 38 a and into the person's coffee cup. In the example of the dedicated coffee maker 50 d of FIGS. 8A and 8B, a funnel part 56 d is included, corresponding to the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B. The funnel part 56 of FIGS. 4A-7B is a feature some existing coffee makers (e.g. Keurig® coffee makers) and therefore is depicted in FIGS. 4A-7B, which may represent embodiments in the context of existing coffee makers. On the other hand, the coffee maker 50 d shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B represents a coffee maker 50 d that is designed for use with the sealed containers 10 , 10 a , etc. of the present disclosure. Thus, the funnel part 56 d can be omitted. FIGS. 9A and 9B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B, including cross-sectional views of a container 10 e placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 9A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 9B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The container 10 e may be a reusable container rather than a disposable container and may differ from the container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above in several respects. First, the container 10 e may have an open or openable top 78 in place of a sealing cap 14 or film 14 b . As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, for example, the top 78 of the container 10 e may contain a central opening 80 , but it is also contemplated that the top 78 may be openable, e.g. by a hinge. Second, the container 10 e may have a pressure relief valve 82 at the bottom. The pressure relief valve 82 , illustrated schematically in FIGS. 9A and 9B, may be of any known construction that is capable of opening in response to a buildup of pressure in the container 10 e or in the bottom region thereof. In a simple construction, the pressure relief valve 82 may be a flap or door that is biased in a closed position to seal against the container 10 e and opens downward when pushed from above. Third, the overall size and shape of the container 10 e may be somewhat larger than that of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above and may, for example, be shaped and sized similarly to a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or other single-serve ground coffee container and designed to fit directly in an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 similar to how the adapter 30 fits in the exit needle part 54 in FIGS. 4A and 4B. For example, an outwardly extending lip 84 of the container 10 e may function just like the lip 36 to allow the container 10 e to rest on the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 without falling in or touching the needle 55 . Since the container 10 e may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the container 10 e , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the container 10 e through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then place the container 10 e inside the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9A and lower the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9B. Heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the container 10 e through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the container 10 e through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. In this regard, the valve 82 may be configured to remain closed under the pressure of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 (i.e. after dispensing liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the reusable container 10 D) and to open under the pressure of the flow of water from the water conduit 60 . It should also be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to open the pressure relief valve 82 should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . When the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 10 e , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 10 e as the water flows through the reusable container 10 e . Thus, one may immediately reuse the container 10 e. FIGS. 10A and 10B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B, 9A, and 9B, including cross-sectional views of another container 10 f placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 10A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 10B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The container 10 f may be the same as the container 10 e and may similarly be reusable, except that the container 10 f may be shaped and sized similarly to an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . Thus, in a case where the coffee maker 50 is a Keurig® coffee maker, an example of the shape and size of the container 10 f is the My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter by Keurig®. Like the container 10 e , since the container 10 f may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the container 10 f , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the container 10 f through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then replace the exit needle part 54 and funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 with the container 10 f as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B (e.g. in the case of a Kuerig® coffee maker 50 , the Keurig® portion pack holder may be pushed up from below and removed, and the container 10 f may be placed in the resulting recess just like a My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter). With the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 lowered as shown in FIG. 10B, heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the container 10 f through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the container 10 f through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. As in the case of the container 10 e , when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 10 f , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 10 f as the water flows through the reusable container 10 f. In the above examples, water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 (and combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 ) are described as flowing through hollow needles 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . However, it is also contemplated that the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may instead only pierce the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. without additionally functioning as a conduit for the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 . For example, the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may retract subsequent to puncturing the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. or be structured to allow the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow adjacent to or around the outside of the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . In the above examples, the top and bottom of the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 enters or exits the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. through the top or bottom of the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. Other points of entry or exit are also contemplated, such as the side. In the above examples, generally cylindrical shapes are depicted for the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. However, other shapes are contemplated as well, such as balls, boxes, etc., and it is contemplated that adapters 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to accommodate such shapes. It is similarly envisioned that the exterior of the adapter 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to fit inside any single-serve coffee maker, e.g. coffee makers by Keurig®, Nespresso®, Mr. Coffee®, Cuisinart®, Presto® MyJo™, Bunn®, etc., and may be designed to fit universally inside more than one coffee maker. The present disclosure further encompasses various embodiments of systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a formed (e.g. molded or otherwise given some shape on a scale larger than a particle or granule) soluble coffee product. A person wishing to make a single serving of coffee takes a container 110 and places it in a coffee maker 200 . Before or after placing the container 110 in the coffee maker 200 , the person may place one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 in the container 110 , optionally along with one or more formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products (throughout this disclosure, descriptions/drawings of formed soluble coffee products 120 may also describe/represent formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products). Unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules, the person may thus mix and match coffees, flavors, etc. to suit his/her taste and desired coffee strength. The person may then close the container 110 with a cap 118 having an orifice 119 . The coffee maker 200 may be a Keurig®, Nespresso®, or other coffee maker that is designed to be used with single-serve ground coffee containers. The person then closes the lid 230 of the coffee maker 50 down on the container 110 , causing a needle 220 of the coffee maker 200 to enter the orifice 119 of the cap 118 and allowing heated water to flow into the container 110 through the orifice 119 . The heated water may flow against, around, and between the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 and any additive products in the container 110 , and the combined soluble coffee etc. and heated water may flow out of the container 110 through holes 114 and into the person's coffee cup. As in the case of the containers 10 e and 10 f , when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 110 , as the heated water from the coffee maker 200 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 110 as the water flows through the container 110 . Afterward, the container 110 may immediately be reused and need not be taken out of the coffee maker 200 . Unlike using Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules, using the container 110 produces no waste. FIGS. 11A, 11B, 11C are a perspective view, a side view, and a top view, respectively, of a container 110 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The container 110 may be filled with one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 (see FIGS. 13B, 14A, 14B, and 15) and closed with a cap 118 (see FIGS. 12A, 12B, 13C, 14A, and 14B), with each formed soluble coffee product 120 containing an amount of soluble coffee for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, e.g. 1 teaspoon of soluble coffee. The container 110 may have a generally cylindrical body 112 as shown with one or more stoppers 116 that extend laterally outward from the container 110 in an upper portion thereof relative to the body 112 (e.g. by 2-10 mm). When the container 110 is inserted into the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 (see FIG. 13A), the body 112 of the container 110 may fit inside the recess 210 while the stoppers 116 do not fit inside the recess 210 . In this way, the stoppers 116 may prevent the container 110 from being inserted too far into the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 and may provide a convenient handhold for a person removing the container 110 from the coffee maker 200 . The stoppers 116 may be a separate piece as shown in FIGS. 11A and 11C (e.g. attached by adhesive or a rivet or other fastener) or may be integrally formed with the body 112 of the container 110 (see FIGS. 14A and 14B). Like the sealed container 10 described above, the container 110 may be made of a recyclable or biodegradable material or combination of materials (and may be made by the same manufacturing methods). However, since the container 110 may be reusable and the moldable soluble coffee product is completely dissolved after the coffee is made, no trash is generated when using the soluble coffee product. Therefore, the container 110 may alternatively be made of a material that is not recyclable or biodegradable, such as plastics including non-recyclable plastics. For example, the body 112 (including stopper 116 ) and cap 118 of the container 110 may be made of a hard plastic such as polypropylene and may be manufactured by injection molding. The overall capacity of the container 110 may be great enough to contain one or more of the formed soluble coffee products 120 and/or formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products. Depending on the coffee maker 200 that the container 110 is to be used with, multiple size settings may be available for dispensing different amounts of heated water (e.g. small, medium, and large). In some cases, a user of the container 110 may want a large cup of coffee without sacrificing coffee strength and may therefore desire to place more formed soluble coffee products 120 in the container 110 when using larger size settings. The user may further wish to add formed soluble flavor and/or creamer additive products to suit his/her taste. Due to the absence of a filter in the container 110 (unlike a Keurig® K-Cup® pod) and the concentrated nature of soluble coffee, the container 110 can be relatively large compared to the size of an individual formed soluble coffee product 120 while the formed soluble coffee product 120 is still large enough to contain an amount suitable for a single cup of coffee. In this way, the container 110 may be sized to fit three, four, five, six, or more formed soluble coffee products 120 and/or formed soluble additive products. The capacity of the container 110 may range from a minimum capacity needed to contain a single formed soluble coffee product 120 (e.g. 5 mL, but may be lower depending on the concentration of the formed soluble coffee product 120 and the desired strength of the coffee) up to a maximum capacity depending on the size of the coffee maker that the container 110 will be used with. For example, if the container 110 will be inserted in a Keurig® coffee maker, a relatively large container 110 may have a capacity of around 40 mL. In the interest of maximizing the size of the container 110 to allow for multiple formed soluble coffee products 120 and additive products, the capacity of the container 110 may be greater than 20 mL, preferably greater than 25 mL, more preferably greater than 30 mL. Accounting for the material(s) of the container 110 itself, the container 110 may have an exterior volume that is slightly greater than its capacity, where the exterior volume is defined as the total volume of liquid displaced when the container 110 is submerged in the liquid. Such exterior volume may similarly range between low values around 5 mL and relatively high values around 40 mL, with the exterior volume greater than the capacity of the container 110 by an amount defined by the volume displaced by the material(s) of the container 110 . The exterior of the container 110 may be shaped to fit inside an existing coffee maker 200 in the same way that a single-serve ground coffee container fits inside the coffee maker 200 . Thus, for example, the exterior of the container 110 may be shaped like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod, a Nespresso® capsule, etc., depending on which existing coffee maker 200 the container 110 is designed for. It is also contemplated that the container 110 may be designed to universally match two or more such existing coffee makers (e.g. by matching a height dimension of one and a width dimension of another). In some cases, an existing coffee maker 200 may have a needle 215 (see FIGS. 14A and 14B) positioned to pierce a lower portion of a single-serve ground coffee container. For example, a Keurig® coffee maker may have a part known as a K-Cup® holder that functions as a recess 210 for receiving a K-Cup® pod, and the K-Cup® holder may have a part known as an exit needle 215 that is positioned to pierce the bottom of the K-Cup® pod at a peripheral region of the K-Cup® pod. The container 110 may be shaped so as to avoid touching or pressing hard against such needle 215 as shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B. In this regard, the container 110 may have a reduced height relative to the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 , so as not to extend deeply enough into the recess to reach the needle 215 , or the container 110 may have an exterior contour with a sloped or stepped region 113 (see FIG. 11B) in a lower portion thereof that slopes or steps inward to avoid the needle 215 . The outer diameter at the bottom of the container 110 may be about 70-95% of the outer diameter at the top of the container 110 (excluding the stoppers 116 ), more preferably 80-90%. For example, the outer diameter at the bottom of the container 110 may be around 3.5-4.0 cm while the outer diameter at the top of the container 110 is around 4.0-4.5 cm. In addition to helping to avoid the needle 215 , such reduced diameter at the bottom of the container 110 may make it easier to insert the container 110 into the coffee maker 200 . Such reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 113 may symmetrically define the exterior of the container 110 or may occur only in a portion of the container 110 , e.g. as a dedicated slot to receive the needle 215 . In combination with the stoppers 116 described above, the reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 113 may prevent the container 110 from being inserted too far into the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 and may allow the container 110 to avoid the needle 215 . As shown in FIGS. 11A, 11C, 13A, 14A, and 14B, the container 110 may have one or more holes 114 in a lower portion (e.g. a lower half, quarter, etc.) thereof. The one or more holes 114 may be used to allow a mixture of soluble coffee and heated water to flow out from the container 110 as the heated water dissolves the formed soluble coffee product 120 . Because the formed soluble coffee product 120 should remain inside the container 110 until it is dissolved, the one or more holes 114 are sized to prevent the formed soluble coffee product 120 from passing therethrough when the formed soluble coffee product 120 is placed in the container 110 . The size (e.g. diameter) of each hole 114 may be, for example, 0.5 to 5 millimeters, preferably 1 to three millimeters, more preferably 1.5 to 2.5 millimeters. If the one or more holes 114 are too small, the flow of dissolved coffee and heated water out of the container 110 will be prevented or slowed. The number of holes 114 may range upward from 1 hole, with a greater number of holes used in the case of smaller holes and with fewer holes used in the case of larger holes. For example, in the case of 2 mm diameter holes, there may be 4 to 14 holes, more preferably 8 to 10 holes. In order to avoid pooling of liquid against the wall of the container 110 , the distance D (see FIG. 11A) between one or more of the holes 114 and the wall of the container 110 may be under 10 mm, preferably under 5 mm, and may be equal to 0 (i.e. one or more of the holes 114 are located at the wall). As shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B, the cap 118 may have a circular shape to fit on a cylindrical container 110 , with an orifice 119 in the middle thereof. The cap 118 may have a stepped structure in which only a reduced-diameter lower part of the cap 118 fits within the interior of the container 110 to produce a snug fit between the container 110 and the cap 118 . It is also contemplated that the cap 118 may be attached to the container 110 by a hinge. FIGS. 13A, 13B, and 13C are perspective views of a coffee maker 200 with the container 110 placed in a recess 210 thereof. In a case where the coffee maker 200 is a Keurig® coffee maker, the recess 210 may be a K-Cup® holder (which itself may be removable). As shown in FIG. 13A, the container 110 may be placed in the recess 210 with the stoppers 116 positioned within grooves 212 of the recess 210 . In this regard, the stoppers 116 may be disposed on the container 110 so as to align with the grooves 212 and may be, for example, a pair of coaxially arranged stoppers 116 . The shape of each stopper 116 may conform to the shape of each groove 212 . For example, in the case of a curved groove 212 , the bottom surface of each stopper 116 may be curved to match the curve of the groove 212 (e.g. with the same or smaller radius curvature). The stoppers 116 may, for example, be cylindrical. Matching the shape of the stoppers 116 to the shape of the grooves 212 may allow for a snug fit to help ensure that the container 110 does not abut too far out of the recess 210 so that the lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 can open and close completely. The reduced height of the container 110 and/or sloped or stepped region 113 may be designed to prevent the container 110 from touching or pressing hard against an exit needle (not shown) of the coffee maker 220 while the stoppers 116 are positioned within the grooves 212 . FIG. 13B shows the same view as FIG. 13A, but with one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 placed in the container 110 . As can be seen, the formed soluble coffee product 120 visible in FIG. 13B (a heart-shaped wafer) completely covers the holes 114 of the container 110 . In this respect, the formed soluble coffee products 120 may have a dimension (e.g. a bottom surface in the case of a wafer shape) that completely covers the one or more holes 114 when placed in the container 110 . As described below in more detail this may improve the efficiency of the process of dissolving the formed soluble coffee products 120 , ensuring that no waste is produced and that the container 110 comes out clean when the process is over. FIG. 13C shows the same view as FIGS. 13A and 13B, but with the cap 118 placed on the container 110 . The orifice 119 of the cap 118 may be positioned such that an entrance needle 220 in a lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 aligns with the orifice 119 and enters the orifice 119 as the lid 230 is moved from an open position (see FIG. 14A) to a closed position (see FIG. 14B). FIGS. 14A and 14B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 200 including cross-sectional views of the container 110 placed inside the coffee maker 200 , with FIG. 14A showing the coffee maker 200 in an open position and FIG. 14B showing the coffee maker 200 in a closed position. As shown, the container 110 is shaped and sized to fit directly in the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 with the one or more stoppers 116 preventing the container 110 from falling into the recess 210 . The illustrated recess 210 is a K-Cup® holder as used in Keurig® coffee makers, including an exit needle part 214 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) and a funnel part 216 . As can be seen, the container 110 is positioned in the recess 210 so as to avoid an exit needle 215 of the exit needle part 214 . In the example of FIGS. 14A and 14B, the full height of the container 110 is short enough to prevent the container 110 from touching (or at least prevent the container 110 from pressing hard against) the needle 215 while the one or more stoppers 116 rests within grooves 212 of the recess 210 (see FIG. 13A). As such, damage to the container 110 can be avoided. In addition to the recess 210 (having the exit needle part 214 and the funnel part 216 ), the coffee maker 200 shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B has a lid 230 (see FIG. 14B as well as FIGS. 13A, 13B, and 13C), a water conduit 235 , a pump 250 , and a heater 260 . The water conduit 235 provides water for making a cup of coffee. For example, water from a water source 240 may flow through the water conduit 235 and into the container 110 as described in more detail below. The water source 240 may be, for example, a fillable water tank of the coffee maker 200 . The pump 250 may pump the water from the water source 240 to the container 110 via the water conduit 235 , and the heater 260 may heat the water. For example, the heater 260 may heat the water while the water is at the water source 240 (e.g. in a water tank) or while the water is en route to the container 110 (e.g. as the water flows through piping or tubing or one or more heating tanks of the water conduit 235 ). Thus, the heater 260 may heat only the amount of water needed for an individual cup of coffee or may heat a larger batch of water. The heater 260 may be an electric heater that heats the water by Joule heating. As in the case of the coffee maker 50 and related embodiments described above, it is also contemplated that the water source 240 of the coffee maker 200 may be a connection to a cold water line of a building, similar to that used by a refrigerator that has a water dispenser or ice maker. In this case, the pump 250 may be omitted as the pressure in the water line is used to bring the water to the container 110 via the water conduit 235 . The lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 may have an entrance needle 220 that is inserted into the orifice 119 of the cap 118 when the coffee maker 200 is in the closed position as shown in FIG. 14B. In the case of an existing coffee maker 200 (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker), the entrance needle 220 may typically be used for piercing a hole in the top of a K-Cup® pod when the lid 230 is pressed down onto the K-Cup® pod. To this end, the entrance needle 220 may have a sharp point at the bottom. The entrance needle 220 may also be hollow and act as a part of the water conduit 235 (e.g. with an upper end of the entrance needle 220 connected to tubing or piping of the water conduit 235 ). As the lid 230 is pressed down onto the container 110 , a bottom face of the lid 230 may abut against the container 110 and the entrance needle 220 may enter the orifice 119 . In this way, the water from the water source 240 may flow through the water conduit 235 and into the container 110 through the tip of the entrance needle 220 . When a person wishes to use the container 110 to make a cup of coffee, he/she may place one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 into the container 110 , along with any desired formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products, and place the cap 118 on the container 110 . The person may then place the container 110 inside the recess 210 of the coffee maker 200 as shown in FIG. 14A and lower the lid 230 of the coffee maker 200 as shown in FIG. 14B. Heated water may then flow from the water conduit 235 into the container 110 through the entrance needle 220 , which may work to dissolve the contents of the container 110 (e.g. soluble coffee, flavor, etc.), and the combined heated water and dissolved soluble coffee (along with any dissolved additives) may flow out of the container 110 through the one or more holes 114 and down into the person's coffee cup. The entire process may produce no waste. Moreover, when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 110 , as the heated water from the coffee maker 200 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 110 as the water flows through the container 110 . For example, the coffee making process may have a first part where the heated water dissolves all of the soluble coffee (along with any soluble additives) and a second part where the heated water continues to flow through the container 110 to rinse out and disinfect the container 110 . During the second part of the coffee making process, any remaining coffee that remains between or around the holes 114 may be forced out of the container 110 by the flow of water. Thus, one may immediately reuse the container 110 . For example, in a case where the entire coffee making process involves flowing twelve ounces of water through the container 110 , the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 and container 110 may be designed such that the first 3-11 ounces (preferably 9-11 ounces, e.g. 10 ounces) of water completely dissolve the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 while the final 1-9 ounces (preferably 1-3 ounces, e.g. 2 ounces) of water rinse the container 110 . As shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B, a plurality of formed soluble coffee products 120 and soluble flavor or creamer additive products may be placed in the container 110 . In the example of FIGS. 14A and 14B, any of the three formed soluble coffee products 120 may be a formed soluble flavor or creamer additive product, which may be used in the same way and may be structurally the same. Specifically, three formed soluble coffee products 120 and/or additive products (hereinafter formed soluble coffee products 120 ) are shown in a stacked arrangement. When preparing a desired combination of contents for his/her cup of coffee, a user may simply stack additional formed soluble coffee products 120 one on top of the other. As shown, the formed soluble coffee products 120 completely cover the holes 114 . As a result, water in a peripheral region within the container 110 between the formed soluble coffee products 120 and the wall of the container 110 (which has in most cases already flowed against the formed soluble coffee products 120 to reach the peripheral region of the container 110 ) may flow against the underside of the formed soluble coffee products 12 as it passes from the peripheral region of the container 110 to the holes 114 . This may result in an efficient dissolving process as the amount of times the water flows against the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be maximized. This may help ensure that no waste is produced and that the container 110 is clean when the process ends. The efficiency of the dissolving process may be further improved by the existence of gaps 123 a , 123 b around the sides of as well as between the stacked formed soluble coffee products 120 , which allow water to flow down, around, and between the stacked formed soluble coffee products 120 to maximize the surface area across which the hot water contacts and the dissolving process takes place. Such gaps 123 a around the sides of the formed soluble coffee products 120 are due to the relative size of the formed soluble coffee products 120 and the container 110 , which may be selected accordingly. In order for there to be gaps 123 b between the formed soluble coffee products 120 , each of the formed soluble coffee products 120 may have one or more protrusions 122 (e.g. on bottoms thereof) to produce a gap 123 b between adjacent formed soluble coffee products 120 . As can be seen, such protrusions 122 may act as spacers to prevent the formed soluble coffee products 120 from lying flush against each other while stacked, thus allowing for water to pass through the gap 123 b between the formed soluble coffee products 120 . By maximizing the surface area for dissolving in these ways, the efficiency of the dissolving process may be improved. This may help ensure that no waste is produced and that the container 110 is clean when the process ends. FIG. 15 is a side view of a single formed soluble coffee product 120 (which may also serve as an illustration of a formed soluble flavor or creamer additive product). The formed soluble coffee product 120 may be made by a freeze-drying process or a spray-drying process. For example, coffee (e.g. brewed coffee or liquid coffee concentrate, which may itself be produced by dehydrating brewed coffee) may be poured into a mold (e.g. a silicon mold, which may withstand cold temperature (e.g., between −50° F. and −32° F., and more particularly as low as −20° F.), and optionally a flavor or creamer additive may be poured into the mold together with the coffee. In this regard, manufacturing the formed soluble coffee product 120 may optionally begin with one or more preliminary steps such as brewing the coffee, dehydrating the coffee to produce a liquid coffee concentrate, grinding roasted coffee beans to produce coffee grounds for brewing, and roasting the coffee beans. The mold may have a desired shape, e.g. a wafer, a ball, or any other shape, including “fun” shapes such as stars, hearts, animals, etc. The coffee and optional additive may then be freeze-dried (e.g. at −20° F. under pressure for 24 hours) while in the mold to produce the formed soluble coffee product 120 . Alternatively, or additionally, ultrasonic energy may be applied to the contents of the mold (e.g. having a frequency between 20 Khz to 35 Khz and more preferably between 27 Khz to 33 Khz). The ultrasonic energy may fuse the contents of the mold to produce the formed soluble coffee product 120 . As another alternative to freeze-drying or ultrasonic energy, or in addition, a water-soluble binder (e.g. sodium bicarbonate, stearic acid, and/or magnesium stearate) may be added to the mold together with the coffee and optional additive. A press may compress the contents of the mold including the binder to form the formed soluble coffee product 120 . It is also contemplated that, in some cases, powdered or granulated soluble coffee, e.g. already freeze-dried soluble coffee, rather than brewed coffee or liquid coffee concentrate, may be placed in the mold to be pressed into the formed soluble coffee product 120 . In the above process, the freeze-drying may be performed in two stages: a pre-freeze stage and a refreeze stage. In the pre-freeze stage, the coffee and optional additive may be frozen in the mold (e.g. at −20° F. In the refreeze stage, the pre-frozen product may be popped out of the mold and allowed to continue the freeze-drying process outside of the mold (e.g. on a tray). Letting the freeze-drying process occur outside of the mold allows the product to breathe and helps remove all of the remaining moisture, which might otherwise be trapped in on by the mold. In addition to one or more protrusions 122 as described above (which may be formed by the shape of the mold), the formed soluble coffee product 120 may have a dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 . The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may be an edible liquid cellulose coating that protects the formed soluble coffee product 120 from breaking apart while it is handled. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may dissolve in water. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may also prevent moisture from entering the formed soluble coffee product 120 . The formed soluble coffee product 120 may be packaged in the dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 after the formed soluble coffee product 120 is manufactured. For example, the newly manufactured formed soluble coffee product 120 may be wrapped in or otherwise surrounded by a sheet of the coating/wrapper material on two or more sides, and the ends of the sheet(s) may then be fused together by the application of heat to create a sealed dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 . Alternatively, the dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may be a cellulose spray that is sprayed onto the newly manufactured formed soluble coffee product 120 after the freeze-drying process described above. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may have a thickness of 0.001 inches to 0.010 inches. The dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 may be sufficiently thin to dissolve fast enough so that hot water dissolves through the dissolvable coating or wrapper 124 and the formed soluble coffee product 120 during the first part of the first part of the coffee making process (i.e. prior to the second part in which the container 110 is rinsed with the remaining water). It is also contemplated that a user may dip a formed soluble coffee product 120 in a dissolvable coating 124 such as a flavor or creamer additive (e.g. powder, liquid) prior to placing the formed soluble coffee product 120 in the container 110 . Such a dissolvable coating 124 may be separately packaged in a container with a suitably sized opening for dipping or with other dispensing means (e.g. a squeeze or pump bottle). The size of the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be predetermined to correspond to a single cup of coffee. Alternatively, the size of the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be predetermined to correspond to less than a single cup of coffee, e.g. a half a cup of coffee or a third of a cup of coffee, in order to encourage mixing and matching of formed soluble coffee products 120 . For example, in some cases, a single cup of coffee of a single type (e.g. flavor, decaf) may be made using three of the same type of formed soluble coffee product 120 , while a single cup of coffee of a mixed type may be made using two formed soluble coffee products 120 of one type and one formed soluble coffee products 120 of another. The size as well as the shape (e.g. surface area) of the formed soluble coffee product 120 may further be predetermined to correspond to an amount of heated water associated with the coffee maker 200 . In this way, it can be ensured that the amount of heated water dispensed by the coffee maker 200 is enough to dissolve the formed soluble coffee product 120 completely, preferably with some additional heated water left over to rinse any remaining residue from the container 110 and ensure that no waste is produced. For example, as noted above, a given coffee maker 200 may have multiple size settings for dispensing different amounts of heated water (e.g. small, medium, and large). The formed soluble coffee product 120 may be sized and shaped such that a single formed soluble coffee product 120 is dissolved completely (with some leftover water) by the “small” size setting. FIG. 16 is a side view of a container 110 a , which is a variant of the container 110 shown in FIGS. 11A, 11B, and 11C. As described above, one or more holes 114 may be provided in a lower portion of the container 110 in order to allow the combined soluble coffee and heated water to pass through the container 110 and into a user's cup. In this regard, the placement of the holes 114 is not limited to the bottom of the container 110 as shown in FIGS. 11A and 11C. For example, as shown in FIG. 16, a container 110 a may be provided that is the same as the container 110 except that holes 114 a are provided on the side walls of the container 110 a instead of holes 114 provided on the bottom (or in addition to holes 114 provided on the bottom). Placing the holes 114 a on the side walls and not on the bottom may help prevent residue from the formed soluble coffee product(s) 120 from escaping out the bottom of the container 110 a prior to the dissolving process (e.g. as the user handles the container 110 a ). In a case where the holes 114 a are provided on the side walls of the container 110 a and not on the bottom, it is contemplated that the bottom of the container 110 a may be sloped in the direction of the holes to aid in removal of the combined soluble coffee and heated water during use, i.e. to avoid pooling in the bottom of the container 110 . FIG. 17 is a cross-sectional view of a container 110 b , which is another variant of the container 110 shown in FIGS. 11A, 11B, and 11C. The container 110 b may be the same as the container 110 except that the container 110 b may be designed to receive multiple predetermined sizes and/or shapes of formed soluble coffee products 120 (e.g. corresponding to desired strengths and/or coffee maker size settings). To this end, the interior of the container 110 b may have two or more nested receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 . In the example of FIG. 17, the receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 are contoured to fit spherical (or at least partially spherical) formed soluble coffee products 120 (e.g. coffee balls), with the lower receptacle 115 - 1 sized to fit a small coffee ball and the upper receptacle 115 - 2 designed to fit a large coffee ball. It is contemplated that additional nested receptacles 115 - 3 , 115 - 4 , etc. may be provided as well, possibly fitting three, four, five, six, or more such coffee balls (or formed soluble coffee products 120 of other shapes). Each of the nested receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 may include one or more holes 114 b - 1 , 114 b - 2 , which may be the same as the holes 114 , 114 a described above except that they may be arranged in sets corresponding to the receptacles 115 - 1 , 115 - 2 as shown. In the example of FIG. 17, the set of holes 114 b - 2 corresponding to the upper receptacle 115 - 2 (for the large coffee ball) provides passage of the combined heated water and soluble coffee for some distance before reaching the exterior of the body 112 of the container 110 b . To this end, the holes 115 b - 2 may have an elongated geometry to serve as tunnels from the interior to the exterior of the container 110 b as shown. In some cases, only a single set of holes 114 b - 1 corresponding to the lowest of the nested receptacles 115 - 1 may be exist. The other holes 114 b - 2 , etc. do not exist. In this way, when the lowest receptacle 115 - 1 is used (e.g. for a small coffee ball), it can be ensured that the heated water does not flow out of any holes 114 b - 2 corresponding to upper receptacles 115 - 2 . Meanwhile, when the upper receptacle 115 - 2 is used (e.g. for a large coffee ball), the water must flow beside and under the coffee balls to dissolve the same. Plus, the lower holes 114 b - 1 may still adequately function to allow the heated water and soluble coffee to flow out of the container 110 b. In the figures and description, the nested shapes are shaped to match a spherical ball shape for the dissolvable coffee product. However, other shapes are also contemplated such as pyramidal, football, egg shaped for the dissolvable coffee product and the nested shapes. It is noted that a coffee ball shape for the formed soluble coffee product 120 may be advantageous in that, owing to its spherical shape, it may roll against the interior of the container 110 b to auto-locate at the correct receptacle 115 without getting stuck in the wrong position or in the wrong orientation (e.g. as a wafer-shaped formed soluble coffee product 120 might get stuck on its end or leaned up against the interior of the container 110 ). This may help ensure that the coffee ball covers the holes 114 b , improving the efficiency of the dissolving process as the water must flow against the coffee ball to exit through the holes 114 b. In the above examples, the heated water enters the container 110 , 110 a , 110 b through the top of the container 110 , 110 a , 110 b . Other points of entry are also contemplated, such as the side. In the above examples, generally cylindrical shapes are depicted for the container 110 , 110 a , 110 b . However, other shapes are contemplated as well, such as balls, boxes, etc., and it is contemplated that coffee makers 200 may be designed to accommodate such shapes. It is similarly envisioned that the exterior of the container 110 , 110 a , 110 b may be designed to fit inside any single-serve coffee maker, e.g. coffee makers by Keurig®, Nespresso®, Mr. Coffee®, Cuisinart®, Presto® MyJo™, Bunn®, etc., and may be designed to fit universally inside more than one coffee maker. FIG. 18 is a perspective view of a coffee maker 300 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, together with formed soluble coffee products 120 to be used with the coffee maker 300 . FIG. 19 is a schematic view of the coffee maker 300 . Except for differences described below, the coffee maker 300 may be the same as the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a , 110 , 210 (preferably 10 , 10 a ) described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/040,470 (the '470 Application), which is incorporated by reference here in entirety. For example, the coffee maker 300 may include a housing 314 , upper portion 316 , base 320 , serving size selector 326 , froth level control 328 , rotatable knob 332 , horizontal slider 338 , flavor concentrate port 346 , flavor concentrate container 348 , cream concentrate port 350 , cream concentrate container 352 , flavor port valve 354 , cream port valve 355 , tubing or piping 356 , water reservoir 368 with sides 376 and open end 378 , lid 370 with sides 374 , intake 372 , pump 382 , computer 384 , boil chamber 386 , mixing chamber 388 , outlet port valve 392 , and wired 396 or wireless connections that are respectively the same as the housing 14 , upper portion 16 , base 20 , serving size selector 26 , froth level control 28 , rotatable knob 32 , horizontal slider 38 , flavor concentrate port 46 , flavor concentrate container 48 , cream concentrate port 50 , cream concentrate container 52 , flavor port valve 54 , cream port valve 55 , tubing or piping 56 , water reservoir 68 with sides 76 and open end 78 , lid 70 with sides 74 , intake 72 , pump 82 , computer 84 , boil chamber 86 , mixing chamber 88 , outlet port valve 92 , and wired 96 or wireless connections of the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a described in the '470 Application. The coffee maker 300 may further include any of the other features described in relation to the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a of the '470 Application. The coffee maker 300 may differ from the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a in that the coffee concentrate port 42 , coffee concentrate container 44 , and coffee port valve 53 may be replaced with a mouth 317 for receiving one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 (and/or formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products, which may also be referred to as formed soluble coffee products 120 herein) and a lid 315 for covering the mouth 317 . As schematically shown in FIG. 19, the mouth 317 may provide access to the mixing chamber 388 . The coffee maker 300 may further differ from the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a in the design of the mixing chamber 388 as described in relation to FIGS. 20 and 21. A person wishing to make a cup of coffee using the coffee maker 300 may simply remove the lid 315 (e.g. the lid 315 may be left covering the mouth 317 to prevent dust from entering the coffee maker 300 while it is not in use), drop one or more formed soluble coffee products 120 into the mixing chamber 388 via the mouth 317 , replace the lid 315 (to prevent splashing and reduce noise during the coffee making process), and initiate the coffee making process using the controls of the coffee maker 300 as described in relation to the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a of the '470 Application. Prior to initiating the coffee making process, the person may optionally add flavor or creamer from the flavor concentrate container 348 and cream concentrate container 352 in the same way as described in the '470 Application in relation to the coffee dispenser 10 , 10 a . Water from the water reservoir 368 is heated by the heater 386 and pumped by the pump 382 into the mixing chamber 388 , where it dissolves the formed soluble coffee product 120 and any formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products (the soluble contents of the mixing chamber 388 ) and mixes with any flavor or creamer concentrates dispensed from the flavor concentrate container 348 or cream concentrate container 352 . The fully dissolved contents then fall into the user's cup 312 . As in the case of the coffee maker 200 described above, the coffee making process may have a first part where the heated water dissolves all of the soluble coffee (along with any soluble additives) and a second part where the heated water continues to flow through the mixing chamber 388 to rinse out and disinfect the mixing chamber 388 . During the second part of the coffee making process, any remaining coffee that remains in the mixing chamber 388 may be forced out of the mixing chamber 388 by the flow of water. FIG. 20 is a cross-sectional view of a container 410 a , which may be integrally disposed within the coffee maker 300 to serve as the mixing chamber 388 . The container 410 a may be the same as the container 110 of FIGS. 11A, 11B, and 11C, including having an internal shape that is the same as that of the body 112 of the container 110 and having one or more holes 414 that are the same as the one or more holes 114 of the container 110 , with the following differences related to its integration in the coffee maker 300 . In particular, the container 410 a may or may not have the same external shape as the container 110 , since the container 410 a may be fixed within the coffee maker 300 and need not be handled by the user. The container 410 a may, for example, be formed as a passageway through the coffee maker 300 from the mouth 317 of the coffee maker 300 to the holes 414 . Another difference from the container 110 is that the container 410 a may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 of the coffee maker 300 by a water input line 422 , a cream concentrate input line 424 , and a flavor concentrate input line 426 . As shown in FIG. 20, the water input line 422 , which may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 leading to the water reservoir 368 , pump 382 , and heater 386 , may be disposed in an upper portion (e.g. top half or top quarter) of the container 410 a , while the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 , which may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 leading to the cream port valve 355 and flavor port valve 354 respectively, may be disposed in a lower portion (e.g. bottom half or bottom quarter) of the container 410 a . By entering the container 410 a in an upper portion, the heated water for dissolving the soluble contents of the container 410 a may have the most opportunity to dissolve the soluble contents of the container 410 a (i.e. the formed soluble coffee product 120 and any formed soluble flavor or creamer additive products) as it passes through gaps 123 a , 123 b around and between the soluble contents as described above in relation to the container 110 . As a result, even in the case of a high stack of soluble contents, the heated water will not pass through the holes 414 and out of the container 410 a without first flowing along the soluble contents to further the dissolving process. In some cases, the water may be pumped by the pump 382 at a high enough pressure to cause the water to shoot out from the water input line 422 and land on the soluble contents at or near the middle of the container 410 a . In this way, the container 410 a can be arranged so that water flows against the soluble contents once as it flows from the middle of the container 410 a to the periphery of the container 410 a , along the side of the soluble contents as it flows down, and then again as it flows from the periphery of the container 410 a inward toward the holes 414 at the bottom of the container before exiting the container 410 a , further improving the efficiency of dissolving as described above in relation to the container 110 . Meanwhile, since the cream concentrate and flavor concentrate need not be dissolved and need only be mixed, the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 may be disposed in the lower portion of the container 410 a . If the cream/flavor concentrate quickly arrives at the holes 414 , that is not a problem as the mixing of the concentrates with the heated water (with dissolved coffee) can still occur in the user's cup 312 . By disposing the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 in the lower portion of the container 410 a , the room temperature concentrates can be prevented from prematurely cooling the heated water while the heated water is dissolving the soluble contents of the container 410 a . In particular, the cream and flavor liquid which are not heated may have a shorter distance out of the container so that the heated water can be as hot as possible. FIG. 21 is a cross-sectional view of a container 410 b , which may be integrally disposed within the coffee maker 300 to serve as the mixing chamber 388 . The container 410 b may be the same as the container 110 b of FIG. 17, including having an internal shape that is the same as that of the body 112 of the container 110 b (including two or more nested receptacles 115 ) and having one or more holes 414 b that are the same as the one or more holes 114 b of the container 110 (and may similarly be arranged in sets corresponding to the nested receptacles 115 ), with the following differences related to its integration in the coffee maker 300 . In particular, the container 410 b may or may not have the same external shape as the container 110 b , since the container 410 b may be fixed within the coffee maker 300 and need not be handled by the user. The container 410 b may, for example, be formed as a passageway through the coffee maker 300 from the mouth 317 of the coffee maker 300 to the holes 414 b. Another difference from the container 110 b , is that, just like the container 410 a , the container 410 b may be connected to the tubing or piping 356 of the coffee maker 300 by a water input line 422 , a cream concentrate input line 424 , and a flavor concentrate input line 426 . The water input line 422 , cream concentrate input line 424 , and flavor concentrate input line 426 may be structured and function in relation to the container 410 b in the same way as described above in relation to the container 410 a . For example, the water input line 422 may be disposed in an upper portion (e.g. top half or top quarter) of the container 410 a to improve the efficiency of dissolving as described above, while the cream concentrate input line 424 and flavor concentrate input line 426 may be disposed in a lower portion (e.g. bottom half or bottom quarter) of the container 410 a to prevent premature cooling of the heated water as described above. In the above examples of FIGS. 20 and 21, it is described that the container 410 a and container 410 b may be integrally formed with the coffee maker 300 to function as the mixing chamber 388 thereof. However, the disclosed embodiments are not intended to be so limited. It is also contemplated, for example, that the container 410 a and container 410 b may be insertable and removable from the coffee maker 300 , or that the container 110 , 110 b may be insertable and removable from the coffee maker 300 . In this case, a user may, for example, freely insert the container 110 , 410 a for use with wafer-shaped formed soluble coffee products and insert the container 110 b , 410 b for use with spherical formed soluble coffee products (e.g. coffee balls). The mixing chamber 388 of the coffee maker 300 may, for example, be a cavity connected to the tubing or piping 356 that leads to the water reservoir 368 , pump 382 , and heater 386 , the tubing or piping 356 that leads to the cream port valve 355 , and the tubing or piping 356 that leads to the flavor port valve 354 . The cavity of the mixing chamber 388 may also include means of locating the container 110 , 110 b , 410 a , 410 b within the mixing chamber 388 , such as an annular ledge around the periphery of the mixing chamber 388 on which the one or more stoppers 116 of the container 110 , 110 b may rest. When the coffee maker 300 is operated, the heated water, cream concentrate, and/or flavor concentrate may flow into the mixing chamber 388 at a position higher than the container 110 , 110 b , 410 a , 410 b via the tubing or piping 356 . The heated water, cream concentrate, and/or flavor concentrate may thus flow into the container 110 , 110 b , 410 a , 410 b to prepare a cup of coffee as described above.
