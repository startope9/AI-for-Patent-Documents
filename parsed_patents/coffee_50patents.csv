DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION An exemplary embodiment of an inventive coffee filter roll is seen generally at 100 in FIG. 3. As shown in the perspective view of FIG. 3, the coffee filter roll 100 generally comprises a plurality of coffee filters 10 successively arranged in a roll configuration, each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 being detachably coupled to one another, and each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 including a plurality of fold lines configured to facilitate an insertion of each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 into a coffee filter basket of a coffee maker; and a plurality of lines of weakness 26 , each of the plurality of lines of weakness 26 being disposed between adjacent the coffee filters 10 in the coffee filter roll 100 . Each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 in FIG. 3 is configured to be separated from the coffee filter roll 100 by tearing the coffee filter 10 being removed from the adjacent coffee filter 10 in the coffee filter roll 100 along at least one of the plurality of lines of weakness 26 . For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the coffee filter 10 a at the end of the roll 100 is being separated from the coffee filter 10 thereabove along the line of weakness 26 (i.e., the coffee filter 10 a is shown partially severed from the coffee filter roll 100 in FIG. 3 to illustrate an exemplary manner in which a coffee filter 10 may be removed from the roll 100 ). In the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 3, it can be seen the coffee filters 10 are rolled around a center cardboard tube 82 , which adds to the overall rigidity of the coffee filter roll 100 . In one or more embodiments, the coffee filters 10 that are rolled in close proximity to the center cardboard tube 82 (which will be dispensed when the roll is about finished) are provided with colored edges (e.g., pink edges) or a numbered countdown in order to signify that the roll 100 needs replaced soon. Referring again to FIG. 3, it can be seen that each of the plurality of coffee filters 10 in the roll 100 is generally octagonal in shape with a plurality of octagonal sides. Also, each interior one of the plurality of coffee filters 10 comprises the lines of weakness 26 on opposed octagonal sides thereof. In one or more embodiments, each line of weakness 26 comprises a plurality of spaced apart elongate perforations (i.e., elongate slits) that allow the coffee filter disposed at the end of the roll 100 (e.g., coffee filter 10 a in FIG. 3) to be easily separated from the remainder of the roll 100 . For example, the lines of weakness 26 may comprise ¼″ long slits spaced apart by ¼″ between slits, ⅛″ long slits spaced apart by ⅛″, 1/16″ long slits spaced apart by 1/16″, 1/32″ long slits spaced apart by 1/32″, etc. Now, turning to FIGS. 1 and 2, the structural features of a first exemplary embodiment of a coffee filter, which is utilized on the roll 100 of FIG. 3, will be described in detail. The coffee filter 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2 is primarily designed for use as a basket-type coffee filter, but can also be used as a cone-style coffee filter. Initially, as shown in the top view of FIG. 1, it can be seen that the coffee filter 10 comprises a generally octagonal coffee filter body 12 with eight (8) octagonal sides. The octagonal sides of the coffee filter 10 are spaced apart from one another by substantially V-shaped notches 15 (i.e., wide V-shaped notches 15 ). Also, it can be seen in FIG. 1 that the coffee filter 10 has a plurality of radially extending fold lines 18 , 20 that are grouped together in a plurality of generally V-shaped sectors 16 (i.e., eight (8) generally V-shaped sectors 16 ). Each of the plurality of generally V-shaped sectors 16 is circumferentially spaced apart from one another about a circumference of the coffee filter 10 (i.e., the generally V-shaped sectors 16 are substantially equally spaced apart from one another about the circumference of the coffee filter 10 so as to create an eight-pointed star shape in the middle of the filter 10 —see FIG. 1). Each generally V-shaped sector 16 comprises a plurality of inner fold lines 20 bounded by a pair of outer fold lines 18 . In addition, the octagonal coffee filter body 12 also includes a circular fold line 14 centrally located on the coffee filter 10 . As depicted in FIG. 1, the outer and inner fold lines 18 , 20 of each V-shaped sector 16 inwardly converge to a respective tip 22 located proximate to the circular fold line 14 (i.e., substantially disposed on the circular fold line 14 ). In one or more embodiments, each of the fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 comprises a line of weakness formed by a plurality of perforations or micro-perforations in the filter substrate or filter media material. The lines of weakness formed by the perforations or micro-perforations allow the coffee filter 10 to be easily inserted into a filter basket (e.g., filter basket 54 in FIGS. 4-7), as will be described hereinafter. For example, the lines of weakness may comprise a custom perforation pattern or a micro-perforation of 70 (i.e., a micro-perforation of 70 teeth per inch). Referring again to FIG. 1, it can be seen that the generally octagonal coffee filter body 12 of the coffee filter 10 comprises tear edges 24 on opposed sides thereof. These tear edges 24 correspond to the lines of weakness or tear perforations 26 described above in conjunction with the coffee filter roll 100 of FIG. 3. That is, each coffee filter 10 is separated from the other coffee filters 10 on the roll 100 by using the tear perforations 26 along the tear edge 24 of the coffee filter 10 . In FIG. 10, an enlarged, detailed view of the filter notches 15 , the tear perforations 26 , and the lines of weakness 18 , 20 (fold lines) for two adjacent coffee filters on the coffee filter roll 100 of FIG. 3 are illustrated. As shown in FIG. 10, the elongate slit perforations that form the tear perforations 26 between adjacent coffee filters 10 on the roll 100 are substantially larger in size than the micro-perforations that form the fold lines 18 , 20 of each coffee filter 10 . As such, the tear perforations 26 allow the coffee filters 10 disposed on the roll 100 to be easily separated from one another when a user pulls on the endmost one 10 a of the filters 10 in the roll 100 (see e.g., FIG. 3). The micro-perforations, which form the fold lines 18 , 20 of each coffee filter 10 , are designed to be sufficiently small so as to prevent coffee grounds from inadvertently passing through the filter 10 . In FIG. 8, the coffee filter 10 is illustrated in a folded state. As shown in this figure, the fold lines 18 , 20 on the side of the folded coffee filter 10 form pleats or crepes that enable the filter to generally conform to the geometry of a basket-style coffee filter basket (e.g., basket 54 , as shown in FIGS. 4-7, or basket 68 , as depicted in FIG. 9). The bottom circular fold line 14 generally conforms to the periphery of the circular bottom wall of the basket-style coffee filter basket. In an exemplary embodiment, with reference to the top view of FIG. 1, the coffee filter 10 has a first overall dimension D 1 of approximately 8.0 inches and a second overall dimension D 2 of approximately 8.0 inches. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the coffee filter 10 has an octagonal side width dimension D 3 of approximately 2.5 inches, a first notch dimension D 4 of approximately nine thirty-seconds ( 9/32) of an inch, and a second notch dimension D 5 of approximately twenty-one sixty-fourths ( 21/64) of an inch. The two sides of each substantially V-shaped notch 15 form an angle θ of approximately 125 degrees in the exemplary embodiment of the invention. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the circular fold line 14 has a radius R 1 of approximately 1.75 inches. Although, it is to be understood that the coffee filter 10 is in no way limited to these particular dimensions. Rather, other suitable dimensions may be used for the coffee filter 10 without departing from the spirit of the invention. Now, referring to FIGS. 4-7, an exemplary process by which the coffee filter 10 is inserted into a filter basket 54 of a residential-type coffee maker will be explained. The residential-type filter basket 54 includes a handle 55 for allowing a user to easily grasp the filter basket 54 . Initially, after generally aligning the coffee filter 10 above the filter basket 54 (see FIG. 4), a hand 84 of a user begins to insert the coffee filter 10 into the top of the filter basket 54 (as shown in FIG. 5), whereby the rim 53 of the filter basket 54 deforms the coffee filter 10 as a result of the fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 (e.g., micro-perforations) in the coffee filter body 12 . In FIG. 6, the coffee filter 10 has been inserted approximately halfway into the filter basket 54 by the hand 84 of the user such that the coffee filter 10 has assumed its substantially folded position, wherein the filter media contains a plurality of generally non-uniform pleats formed by the sector fold lines 18 , 20 . The circular fold line 14 is designed to substantially correspond to the circular bottom wall of the filter basket 54 . Finally, as depicted in FIG. 7, the coffee filter 10 is completely pushed down into the filter basket 54 by the hand 84 of the user until the inner circular portion of the coffee filter 10 , which is circumscribed by the circular fold line 14 , generally contacts the top surface of the circular bottom wall of the filter basket 54 . Once the coffee filter 10 has been fully inserted into the filter basket 54 , the sector fold lines 18 , 20 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 53 (refer to FIG. 7). The perspective view of FIG. 9 is similar to that of FIG. 7, except that the folded coffee filter 10 is disposed inside a commercial-type filter basket 68 (which is used with a commercial-type coffee maker), rather than in the residential-type filter basket 54 of FIGS. 4-7. Similar to the residential-type filter basket 54 described above, the commercial-type filter basket 68 includes a handle 70 and a rim 72 . It is to be understood that the process described above in conjunction with FIGS. 4-7 is equally applicable to commercial-type filter basket 68 of FIG. 9. Also, as explained above for the residential-type filter basket 54 , once the coffee filter 10 has been fully inserted into the commercial-type filter basket 68 , the sector fold lines 18 , 20 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 72 (refer to FIG. 9). The perspective view of FIG. 11 is similar to that of FIGS. 7 and 9, except that the folded coffee filter 10 is disposed inside a cone-shaped filter basket 74 , rather than in the basket-shaped filter baskets 54 , 68 of FIGS. 7 and 9. Similar to the basket-shaped filter baskets 54 , 68 described above, the cone-shaped filter basket 74 includes a rim 76 . It is to be understood that the process described above in conjunction with FIGS. 4-7 is equally applicable to cone-shaped filter basket 74 . When the coffee filter 10 is used with a cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the bottom wall of the filter 10 , which is circumscribed by circular fold line 14 , is simply pushed towards the tip 78 of the filter basket 74 until it generally deforms in accordance with the interior geometry of the cone-style filter basket 74 . Also, as explained above for basket-shaped filter baskets 54 , 68 , once the coffee filter 10 has been fully inserted into the cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the sector fold lines 18 , 20 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 76 (refer to FIG. 11). In accordance with another aspect of one or more embodiments of the present invention, the coffee filter roll 100 described above may be used in conjunction with a coffee filter dispensing system. In addition to the coffee filter roll 100 , the coffee filter dispensing system may further include a dispenser housing substantially enclosing the coffee filter roll 100 . For example, as illustrated in FIG. 12, the dispenser system may be in the form of a manual coffee filter dispenser 200 , wherein the coffee filter roll 100 is designed to be manually unrolled by a user thereof. In FIG. 12, it can be seen that the coffee filter roll 100 is contained within a dispensing housing in the form of a generally rectangular box 202 (i.e., the box 202 is generally in the form of a rectangular prism). The front of the box 202 includes an elongated aperture 204 (i.e., an elongated dispensing slot 204 ) for allowing the passage of one or more unrolled coffee filters 10 therethrough. As illustrated in FIG. 12, the width of the elongated dispensing slot 204 substantially corresponds to the width dimension of each coffee filter 10 (i.e., the elongated dispensing slot 204 is generally equal to the width dimension of each coffee filter 10 , but with an added clearance on each side of the coffee filter (e.g., ⅛ inch on each side) so that the roll outer edges do not contact the opposed ends of the slot 204 and oppose the unrolling of the coffee filter roll 100 . As additionally shown in FIG. 12, a surface of the box 202 , which houses the coffee filter roll 100 , may be provided with attachment means for attaching the dispenser box 202 to a structure in a room (e.g., the underside of kitchen cabinets, etc.). Specifically, in FIG. 12, the dispenser box 202 is provided with a plurality of adhesive strips 206 (e.g., three (3) adhesive strips 206 ) spaced apart along the top surface thereof for attaching the box 202 to a structure in a room, such as a cabinet, etc. For example, each of the adhesive strips 206 may comprise double-faced tape or another suitable type of adhesive means for removably securing the dispenser box 202 to a structure in the room. While the adhesive strips 206 are shown on the top surface of the box 202 in FIG. 12, it is to be understood that the adhesive strips 206 alternatively may be provided on other surfaces of the box 202 as well so as to accommodate a plurality of different mounting arrangements (e.g., on the bottom surface of the box 202 so that it may be adhered to a countertop or on one or more of the lateral surfaces of the box 202 ). Advantageously, the box 202 containing the coffee filter roll 100 can be stored in a drawer or cabinet, attached to the inside of a cabinet door, or mounted to the underside of a cabinet with the adhesive strips 206 . In exemplary embodiment, the box 202 has a length of approximately nine (9) inches and a cross-sectional area of approximately three (3) inches by three (3) inches. Although, it is to be understood that the box 202 is in no way limited to these particular dimensions, as the exact specifications may vary depending upon manufacturing. Other suitable dimensions may be used for the box 202 without departing from the spirit of the invention. Another example of a manual-type coffee filter dispensing system is illustrated in FIG. 13. In this figure, it can be seen that the coffee filter roll 100 is supported by a hanging device 62 attached to the underside of a cabinet 60 (e.g., a kitchen cabinet or kitchenette cabinet). As shown in FIG. 13, the hanging device 62 comprises a generally cylindrical rod 66 for accommodating the coffee filter roll 100 thereon (i.e., the cylindrical rod 66 is inserted into the central circular aperture in the coffee filter roll 100 in a similar manner in which a paper towel roll is supported). The opposed ends of the generally cylindrical rod 66 of the hanging device 62 are supported by respective end brackets 64 . The top surfaces of each end bracket 64 are attached to the bottom surface of the cabinet 60 . In order to permit an empty coffee filter roll 100 to be removed and replaced with a new coffee filter roll 100 , it is to be understood that one or more of the end brackets 64 may be detachably coupled to the rod 66 (e.g., one or more of the end brackets 64 may snap into engagement with the rod 66 , and may be designed to pivot upwardly about a rotational axis disposed proximate to its cabinet securement location so that it is capable of swinging out of the way when a new coffee filter roll 100 is being placed on the rod 66 ). As further illustrated in FIG. 13, the coffee filter roll 100 , which is rotatably supported on the hanging device 62 , is conveniently placed in close proximity to a coffee maker 50 , which utilizes the coffee filters 10 on roll 100 . The coffee maker 50 generally comprises a carafe or pot 52 for containing brewed coffee therein, a filter basket 54 that receives one of the coffee filters 10 therein, an on-off switch 56 for activating the coffee maker 50 , and a main body portion 58 that contains the primary components of the coffee maker 50 . When it is necessary to change or add a new coffee filter 10 to the coffee maker 50 , the filter basket 54 is designed to be slidingly removed from the remainder of the coffee maker 50 when a user pulls outwardly on the handle 55 of the filter basket 54 . Referring again to FIG. 13, it can be seen that a box 202 with a coffee filter roll 100 therein is disposed on the countertop next to the coffee maker 50 . Like the manual coffee filter dispenser 200 described above in conjunction with FIG. 12, the coffee filter box 202 comprises an elongated dispensing slot 204 in the lower front side thereof for allowing the passage of one or more unrolled coffee filters 10 therethrough. Although, unlike the coffee filter dispenser 200 of FIG. 12, a plurality of adhesive strips 208 (e.g., three (3) adhesive strips 208 ) are located on the bottom surface of the box 202 , rather than on the top surface of the box. In FIG. 13, the adhesive strips 208 , which are located on the bottom surface of the box 202 , allow the box to be removably attached to the top surface of the countertop so that coffee filters 10 may be easily dispensed, and torn from the roll 100 , without the box 202 undesirably sliding along the countertop surface. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the dispenser system also may be in the form of an automatic coffee filter dispenser 300 , wherein the coffee filter roll 100 is designed to be automatically unrolled by an actuator 306 disposed inside a dispensing housing 302 . Similar to the manual dispensing box 202 described above, the front of the automatic dispenser housing 302 includes an elongated aperture 304 (i.e., an elongated dispensing slot 304 ) for allowing the passage of one or more unrolled coffee filters 10 therethrough. The coffee filter roll 100 is supported on a support bracket 312 inside the dispenser housing 302 . The coffee filter roll 100 is rotatably coupled, and removably coupled to the support bracket 312 so that an empty coffee filter roll 100 is able to be removed, and replaced with a new coffee filter roll 100 . In FIG. 14, it can be seen that the automatic dispenser system 300 further includes a sensor device 308 for detecting a presence of a user (e.g., for detecting the presence of a hand of a user proximate thereto). The sensor device 308 may comprise an infrared sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, or any other suitable sensor or combination of sensors. The sensor device 308 is operatively coupled to the actuator 306 so that the coffee filter roll 100 is capable of being automatically advanced when the presence of the user is detected by the sensor device 308 (i.e., when the hand of the user is located proximate to the sensor 308 ). When the presence of the user is detected by the sensor device 308 on the front of the dispenser housing 302 , the coffee filter media on the coffee filter roll 100 is automatically advanced so that a coffee filter 10 is always accessible to a user. In particular, the coffee filter media is automatically advanced by the geared actuator rollers 306 , which are operatively coupled to a motive device inside the housing 302 , such as an electric motor. As shown in FIG. 14, the path of the coffee filter media inside the housing 302 is also regulated by the guide rollers 310 . The coffee filter media is unrolled within the housing 302 by means of its generally sandwiched arrangement between at least one of the geared actuator rollers 306 and the guide rollers 310 . Next, with reference to FIGS. 15 and 16, the structural features of a second exemplary embodiment of a coffee filter, which may be utilized on a coffee filter roll (e.g., on the coffee filter roll 100 of FIG. 3), will be explained in detail. Advantageously, the coffee filter 10 ′ of FIGS. 15 and 16 can readily be used as both a basket-type coffee filter and a cone-type coffee filter. As illustrated in the top view of FIG. 15, similar to the coffee filter 10 described above, the coffee filter 10 ′ comprises a generally octagonal coffee filter body 12 ′ with eight (8) octagonal sides. Also, like the coffee filter 10 , the octagonal sides of the coffee filter 10 ′ are spaced apart from one another by substantially V-shaped notches 15 . Although, unlike the coffee filter 10 , the coffee filter 10 ′ does not contain fold lines that are arranged together in sectors. Rather, the coffee filter 10 ′ comprises a plurality of radially extending fold lines 34 that are generally equally spaced apart from one another about a circumference of the coffee filter 10 ′. Also, it can be seen in FIG. 15 that the coffee filter 10 ′ has an inner circular fold line 28 centrally located on the coffee filter body 12 ′ thereof. In addition, the coffee filter 10 ′ further includes an outer circular fold line 30 disposed outside of the inner circular fold line 28 in a circumscribing relationship therewith. As shown in FIG. 15, the outer circular fold line 30 is generally concentric with the inner circular fold line 28 . Each of the radially extending fold lines 34 extends approximately from the outer circular fold line 30 to the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 ′. The radially extending fold lines 34 are disposed generally perpendicular to the outer circular fold line 30 . In addition, referring again to FIG. 15, it can be seen that the coffee filter body 12 ′ of the coffee filter 10 ′ also includes a middle fold line 32 extending the full width of the coffee filter 10 ′, and bisecting the coffee filter 10 ′ into two substantially equal halves. In particular, the middle fold line 32 of the coffee filter 10 ′ facilitates the insertion of the coffee filter 10 ′ into a cone-type filter basket of a coffee maker. In one or more embodiments, similar to that described above for the coffee filter 10 , each of the fold lines 28 , 30 , 32 , 34 of the coffee filter 10 ′ comprises a line of weakness formed by a plurality of perforations or micro-perforations in the filter substrate or filter media material. For example, the lines of weakness may comprise a custom perforation pattern or a micro-perforation of 70 (i.e., a micro-perforation of 70 teeth per inch). In FIG. 18, the coffee filter 10 ′ is illustrated in a folded state. As shown in this figure, the fold lines 34 on the side of the folded coffee filter 10 form pleats that enable the filter to generally conform to the geometry of either a basket-style coffee filter basket (e.g., basket 54 , as shown in FIGS. 4-7, or basket 68 , as depicted in FIG. 9) or a cone-style coffee filter basket (e.g., basket 74 , as shown in FIGS. 11 and 17). The outer circular fold line 30 generally conforms to the periphery of the circular bottom wall of the basket-style coffee filter basket. In an exemplary embodiment, with reference to the top view of FIG. 15, the coffee filter 10 ′ has a first overall dimension D 1 of approximately 8.0 inches and a second overall dimension D 2 of approximately 8.0 inches. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the coffee filter 10 ′ has an octagonal side width dimension D 3 of approximately 2.5 inches, a first notch dimension D 4 of approximately nine thirty-seconds ( 9/32) of an inch, and a second notch dimension D 5 of approximately twenty-one sixty-fourths ( 21/64) of an inch. The two sides of each substantially V-shaped notch 15 form an angle θ of approximately 125 degrees in the exemplary embodiment of the invention. Also, in the exemplary embodiment, the inner circular fold line 28 has a radius R 2 of approximately 1.0 inches, while the outer circular fold line 30 has a radius R 3 of approximately 1.75 inches. Although, it is to be understood that the coffee filter 10 ′ is in no way limited to these particular dimensions. Rather, other suitable dimensions may be used for the coffee filter 10 ′ without departing from the spirit of the invention. The perspective view of FIG. 17 is similar to that of FIG. 11, except that the coffee filter 10 ′ of the second exemplary embodiment is disposed inside the cone-shaped filter basket 74 , rather than the coffee filter 10 of the first exemplary embodiment. As described above, the cone-shaped filter basket 74 includes a rim 76 and a tip 78 . It is to be understood that the process for inserting the coffee filter 10 ′ into the cone-shaped filter basket 74 of FIG. 17 is essentially the same as the process described above in conjunction with FIGS. 4-7. However, unlike the coffee filter 10 that was described in connection with FIGS. 4-7 above, the coffee filter 10 ′ includes the inner circular fold line 28 and the middle fold line 32 , which render it particularly suitable for use in a cone-shaped filter basket, such as the basket 74 depicted in FIG. 17 . When the coffee filter 10 ′ is used with a cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the generally concentric inner and outer circular fold lines 28 , 30 generally conform to the conical geometry of the basket 74 . Also, the middle fold line 32 of the coffee filter 10 ′ generally conforms to the flattened-style tip 78 of the cone-shaped basket 74 , as well as the opposed linear side portions 80 of the cone-shaped basket 74 . That is, when the coffee filter 10 ′ is in its folded-state in the cone-shaped basket 74 , the middle fold line 32 of the coffee filter 10 ′ is disposed along the interior of the flattened-style tip 78 and opposed linear side portions 80 (i.e., the middle fold line 32 is disposed within an imaginary plane bisecting the cone-shaped filter basket 74 in a longitudinal direction). Turning again to FIG. 17, similar to that explained above for the fold lines 18 , 20 of the coffee filter 10 , once the coffee filter 10 ′ has been fully inserted into the cone-shaped filter basket 74 , the radially extending fold lines 34 of the filter media form a plurality of generally uniform pleats, and the outer peripheral edge of the coffee filter 10 ′ is substantially aligned with the top surface of the filter basket rim 76 . In one or more embodiments, the filter media forming the coffee filter roll 100 , and the detachable coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ rolled therein, comprises a single-ply material. That is, the coffee filter roll 100 comprises a single, rolled layer of filter media, and each of the detachable coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ comprises a coffee filter that is completely flat when laid out in its unfolded state before being inserted into the filter basket. Unlike conventional cone-type coffee filters, the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ do not comprise adjacent, substantially parallel, multiple layers of material that form a collapsed pocket in their unfolded state. Also, unlike conventional basket-type coffee filters, the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ are not arranged in a stacked configuration when packaged. That is, each coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ is not stacked within another coffee filter in the packaged state. In one or more embodiments, the single-ply coffee filter media may comprise porous 17 pound (17#) paper with a density of approximately 64 grams per square meter (64 gsm), or 25 pound (25#) paper with a density of approximately 90 grams to 100 grams per square meter (between 90-100 gsm, inclusive). The single-ply coffee filter media may have moderate wet strength so that is does not easily tear when saturated with water after brewing the pot of coffee. Also, in one or more embodiments, the coffee filter media may be impregnated with a flavor-producing substance that adds a particular flavor to the coffee as it passes through the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ during the coffee brewing process. For example, the flavor-producing substance may comprise any flavor that is commonly used to flavor coffee, such as mocha, vanilla, French vanilla, caramel, cinnamon, Irish cream, cream and sugar, cappuccino, etc. Advantageously, when such a flavor-impregnated filter is used, the coffee will be automatically flavored during brewing process, thereby obviating the need to separately flavor the coffee after the brewing process. In addition, in one or more embodiments, the coffee filter fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 32 , 34 and tear perforations 26 are formed in the following manner. First, a continuous roll of filter material or filter media is fed between two rollers. The first roller (e.g., a top roller die or hard cylinder die) has a pattern of micro-perforation projections to form the fold lines of the filter, a pattern of slit-like projections to form the tear perforation lines 26 between filters, as well as edge cutting means to form the overall shape of the filters (e.g., octagonal shape). The second roller (e.g., a bottom roller) rotates at the same speed as the first roller die (e.g., a top roller die) and provides the firm backing/pressure that is required for the cutting die to cut into the filter media, and to form the fold lines 14 , 18 , 20 , 28 , 32 , 34 , tear perforations 26 , and the proper edge geometry. Then, the still continuous filter roll is fed onto cardboard rolls, where it is spun until a predetermined quantity of filters is disposed on each of the rolls. After the predetermined quantity of filters is disposed on each of the rolls, each roll is cut, and each roll is placed in its packaging (e.g., in its box). In some embodiments, the coffee filters initially may be pressed by the first and second rollers in an arrangement comprising 5-10 coffee filters in a width direction. After which, the roll comprising 5-10 coffee filters in the width direction may be sliced lengthwise so that the continuous sheets of coffee filters may be fed onto multiple rolls. In accordance with yet another aspect of one or more embodiments of the present invention, a method of dispensing rolled coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ will be described hereinafter while generally referring to the dispensing systems illustrated in FIGS. 12-14. Initially, the coffee filter roll 100 is advanced such that at least a portion of one of the plurality of coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ becomes unrolled from the coffee filter roll 100 . When a dispenser housing is provided that substantially encloses the coffee filter roll 100 , such as in the dispensing systems 200 , 300 , a portion of at least one of the plurality of coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ passes through the elongated aperture 204 , 304 in the dispenser housing 202 , 302 such that it is exposed outside the dispenser housing 202 , 302 . When the dispensing system is a manual-type dispenser, such as the dispensing system 200 in FIG. 12, the advancing of the coffee filter roll 100 is manually performed by a user pulling on the exposed end portion of the roll 100 . In contrast, when the dispensing system is a automatic-type dispenser, such as the dispensing system 300 in FIG. 14, the coffee filter roll 100 is automatically advanced by an actuating means, such as the geared actuator rollers 306 in the dispenser housing 302 . After the coffee filter roll 100 is sufficiently advanced either manually or automatically, the endmost coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ is separated from the remainder of the coffee filter roll 100 by tearing the coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ being removed from the adjacent coffee filter 10 , 10 ′ in the coffee filter roll 100 along at least one of the plurality of lines of weakness 26 (i.e., tear perforations 26 ). It is readily apparent that the aforedescribed coffee filter roll 100 , coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 , and method of dispensing rolled coffee filters offer numerous advantages. First, the coffee filter roll 100 and coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 using the same provide people with quick and convenient access to coffee filters, and ensure only one filter is used at a time. Moreover, the coffee filter roll 100 and coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 described herein protect the coffee filters 10 , 10 ′ from contaminants while stored away, and they reduces the overall amount of time it takes to make coffee. Finally, the coffee filter roll 100 and coffee filter dispensing systems 200 , 300 are ideal for use in both residential and commercial settings. Similar benefits are enjoyed by practicing the method of dispensing rolled coffee filters described herein. Any of the features or attributes of the above described embodiments and variations can be used in combination with any of the other features and attributes of the above described embodiments and variations as desired. Although the invention has been shown and described with respect to a certain embodiment or embodiments, it is apparent that this invention can be embodied in many different forms and that many other modifications and variations are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. Moreover, while exemplary embodiments have been described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the exemplary embodiments set forth above are merely illustrative in nature and should not be construed as to limit the claims in any manner. Rather, the scope of the invention is defined only by the appended claims and their equivalents, and not, by the preceding description.","9266663"

TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to the technical field of machine preparation of coffee drinks, in particular a coffee machine, a coffee bean container (coffee bean hopper) for use with said coffee machine, and a system comprising a coffee machine and a coffee bean container. BACKGROUND Coffee drinks have been consumed for a long time. The general principle is basically always the same: a coffee bean is roasted, then the roasted coffee bean is ground into ground coffee, then a liquid, usually hot water, is applied to the ground coffee. In this last step, the liquid absorbs flavors from the ground coffee and can be consumed as a coffee drink. There are various manual and machine options for preparing coffee drinks. In particular, the machines for the preparation of coffee drinks enjoy great popularity. Coffee machines can be designed according to different principles. Usually, a coffee machine contains a reservoir for ground coffee. Hot water is then fed through the ground coffee and subsequently collected in a drinking vessel. The ground coffee reservoir may be sized to hold ground coffee for one or more servings of the coffee drink. The ground coffee can either be introduced into the reservoir in ground state, or coffee beans can be ground first and immediately prior to brewing, and the resulting ground coffee is then introduced into the reservoir. The liquid is then either applied to the ground coffee under pressure or it flows through the ground coffee without pressure merely under the effect of gravity. Other coffee machines are designed to hold pre-portioned ground coffee in a variety of containers and feed hot water through these containers. A fundamental difference between the existing types of coffee machines is whether the roasted coffee beans are freshly ground before the brewing process or whether the ground coffee is already in the ground state. For a high-quality coffee drink, it can be advantageous and desirable to grind the coffee beans only immediately before the brewing process, because the ground coffee can lose flavor and aroma if left to stand for a long time. SUMMARY It can be considered an object to simplify and make more flexible the manufacturing process of coffee drinks including the grinding process of coffee beans, so that coffee drinks based on different coffee beans and with a different setting of the coffee machine can be produced in any and changing order with one coffee machine without much effort. One or more objects are solved by the embodiments described herein. According to a first aspect, a coffee machine is disclosed having a housing, a coffee bean container receiving arrangement, and a grinder. The coffee bean container receiving arrangement is configured to receive a coffee bean container. The grinder is configured to grind coffee beans. The coffee bean container receiving arrangement may include a container holder and an actuator. The container holder is configured to receive a coffee bean container. The actuator is arranged and configured to move a closing device from an open state to a closed state and vice versa. The closing device is arranged on the container holder or the coffee bean container, and the closing device is arranged to selectively close or open an inlet opening on the container holder or the coffee bean container. The actuator is further configured to move the closing device from the open state to the closed state after an adjustable period of time, thereby presetting a quantity of coffee beans to be fed to the grinder. The coffee machine further may include a detection device, which is designed to detect and read an identification of a coffee bean container. The coffee machine is designed to set the time period after which the closing device is moved from the open state to the closed state depending on the detected identification of the coffee bean container. This design allows the coffee machine to adjust the amount of coffee beans needed to make one serving of coffee. The coffee bean container is placed on or coupled to the inlet opening of the coffee bean container receiving arrangement so that coffee beans that fall out of the coffee bean container are fed to the grinder. The closing device opens and closes the inlet opening. Because the time period between the opening and closing of the inlet opening is fixed, the amount of coffee beans dropped out is predetermined or influenced thereby. In other words, the amount of coffee beans let through is determined by the length of time the inlet opening is open. The closing device can be, for example, a flap or a slide, which is guided into the inlet opening by a translatory or rotatory movement, thus preventing further coffee beans from entering the receiving space from the coffee bean container. The inlet opening can be arranged directly on the coffee bean container or on the container holder. It may be advantageous if the inlet opening together with the closing device is arranged directly on the coffee bean container. When the closing device is closed, the coffee bean container can be removed from the container holder without further coffee beans falling out of the coffee bean container towards the grinder, or generally into the coffee machine. The closing device can open the inlet opening (i.e., the opening through which coffee beans are fed from the coffee bean container into the coffee machine, i.e., the grinder or a feeder to the grinder) completely or only partially. I.e., the opening cross-section of the inlet opening is adjustable. The size of the opening cross-section can also influence the quantity of coffee beans fed in. Generally speaking, the actuator in interaction with the closing device allows to adjust the amount of coffee beans supplied per time. In addition to the time the closing device is in the open position, the size of the opening cross-section of the inlet opening can also be varied to determine the amount of coffee beans for the preparation of a coffee drink. The coffee machine has a detection device that detects and reads an identification of the coffee bean container inserted into the container holder. The identification can be a contactless readable element, for example an RFID chip. Alternatively, the identification can be an element that is read via one or more contact pins between the coffee bean container and the coffee machine. The identification contains, for example, identification data that enable the coffee machine to read out an identifier of the coffee bean container that has been inserted. Alternatively or additionally, other values can also be read from the identification. The coffee machine, for example a controller or a control unit of the coffee machine, can then be set based on the read-out identification or with the help of the read-out values. For this purpose, for example, a value for the open time of the closing device for the preparation of a coffee drink can be stored in the identification. Alternatively, the coffee machine can contain a memory which contains the values for setting the coffee machine for a specific identification value of a coffee bean container, for example a so-called look-up table. The operation of the coffee bean container identification and the reading of the identification is described here, for example, with reference to the open time of the closing device. The same principle can be applied to several other parameters of the coffee machine. Some of these parameters can be: grinding degree of the grinder, water pressure, water temperature, pressure curve, without being limited to these parameters. The coffee bean container identification is used to adjust the coffee machine to the coffee beans contained in a coffee bean container. In one embodiment, the container holder encloses a receiving space for coffee beans, and the actuator is further arranged to act on the container holder to change a size of the receiving space. The actuator is further configured, when the receiving space is filled with coffee beans, to place the closing device in the closed state and to feed the coffee beans from the receiving space to the grinder. Generally speaking, the size of the receiving space is a measure of the quantity of coffee beans used in a grinding process. The time period after which the closing device is moved from the open state to the closed state is also a measure of the quantity of coffee beans used in a grinding process. The mechanism of the variable size receiving space and the adjustable time period in which the closing device is held in the open state may alternatively and independently be implemented in a coffee machine described herein. The receiving space is located in the direction of flow of the coffee beans in the direction of the grinder downstream of the closing device. The opening and closing of the closing device controls when coffee beans are fed into the receiving space. By changing the size of the receiving space of the container holder, it is possible to determine how many coffee beans are released from the coffee bean container and used for the production of one service of coffee. By changing the size of the receiving space of the container holder, it is not necessary to close the closing device after a certain run-in time to prevent too many coffee beans from entering the receiving space. Rather, the receiving space is adjusted accordingly and then completely filled with coffee beans. An intrusion of coffee beans into the receiving space is thus automatically stopped when the receiving space is filled. Now the closing device is brought into the closed state and the coffee is ground in the correct portion. Further coffee beans can now no longer flow out of the coffee bean container. This design has another advantage. Several coffee bean containers with different coffee beans can be used with the same coffee machine. After a portion of coffee has been prepared, the closing device of the container holder is in the closed state, and there are no more coffee beans in the receiving space. The coffee bean container can now be detached from the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and another coffee bean container can be applied. Now that there are no beans from the previous operation in the coffee machine, a new operation can be started for making a portion of coffee with a different type of bean. In a coffee machine with grinder, which freshly grinds the ground coffee for a portion of coffee as needed, it is generally not possible or customary to change the coffee beans as long as there are still beans in a bean container. Changing to a different coffee bean type is thus limited to the time when the bean container has been emptied. This problem is solved in that only as many coffee beans as are needed to prepare a portion of coffee are discharged from the coffee bean container into the receiving space. The coffee bean container is then separated from the receiving space by the closing device. The coffee bean container can be detached from the coffee bean container receiving arrangement, closing the outlet opening of the coffee bean container, and another coffee bean container with a different type of coffee beans can be used. After another coffee bean container is inserted into the coffee bean container receiving arrangement, the size of the receiving space for coffee beans can be changed to use the appropriate amount of coffee beans for the desired coffee flavor or considering the characteristics of the coffee beans. In other words, the function of the coffee machine can be described as follows: the coffee machine is designed for the preparation of coffee drinks based on freshly ground coffee; the container holder with variable receiving space holds the appropriate amount of coffee beans for one serving of coffee at a time and further coffee beans are prevented from entering the receiving space; after preparation of one serving of coffee, the same coffee bean type can be used for another serving of coffee or the coffee bean container can be exchanged to prepare a coffee with a different flavor. A coffee drink can thus be prepared freshly and the same coffee machine can be operated alternately with different coffee bean types without mixing beans of different types in a significant ratio (apart from, for example, minor residues from previous operations in the grinder or other components of the coffee machine, which have no discernible influence on the coffee taste). The grinder is designed in such a way that usually no whole beans remain in the grinder after making a coffee drink. The receiving space is defined or limited by the outer wall of the container holder (lateral boundary), by a part of the coffee machine (lower boundary) and by the closing device (upper boundary). The closing device is connected to the container holder. When the actuator has transferred the closing device to the closed state, the coffee beans can be ground. Either the coffee beans are fed to the grinder separately or the coffee beans lie on the grinder and the grinder is simply activated. The actuator can also be connected to the grinder in order to adjust the grinding degree of the ground coffee by adjusting the grinding disks. For example, a distance between the grinding discs of the grinder is changed. Grinding can be performed by means of conventional disc or cone grinders. Other designs are possible, e.g., a roller grinder or a rotary piston grinder, in which the ground coffee is ground between the outer housing and an asynchronously rotating inner piston, whereby the asynchronously rotating piston can implement several grinding stages in one revolution. Nozzles for wetting the coffee beans with liquid can be arranged in the outlet volume. This can reduce or even avoid static charges during the grinding process. In addition, liquids can be used at this stage before the grinding process to influence the flavor profile. The coffee bean container may be configured in a particular manner for use with the coffee machine described herein. For example, the coffee bean container has an outlet with a closure that is opened when the coffee bean container is coupled to the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and that is automatically closed when the coffee bean container is released from the coffee bean container receiving arrangement. This keeps the beans in the coffee bean container fresh for a long period of time and prevents excessive reaction with the ambient air. Further properties and features of the coffee bean container are presented and explained in the course of this description. According to one embodiment, the actuator is arranged and configured to move the container holder translationally with respect to the housing of the coffee machine to change the size of the receiving space. Alternatively or additionally, the actuator is arranged to move a shell surface of the container holder to change the size of the receiving space. The actuator can be, for example, an electric motor, stepper motor, servomotor, which moves the container holder in or out with respect to the housing of the coffee machine, thereby changing the receiving space, i.e., the interior space of the container holder. Thus, the amount of coffee beans that can be accommodated in the receiving space can be varied. This movement of the container holder can, for example, also entrain the coffee bean container. Based on the above mentioned boundaries of the receiving space by the coffee machine, the lateral wall of the container holder and the closing device, the size of the receiving space in this example is varied in that the upper boundary of the receiving space (the container holder together with the closing device) moves with respect to the coffee machine, thus changing the size of the receiving space. Alternatively or in addition to this translational movement, a shell surface of the container holder can be manipulated, for example by an unwinding movement or a winding movement, to adjust the circumference of the container holder and thus the receiving space. The container holder can be cylindrical or sectionally funnel-shaped. In a funnel shape, a change in the diameter of one opening (the smaller opening, the larger opening, or both openings) can be made to change the size of the receiving space. A cylindrical container holder can be moved along its central axis to change the length of the cylinder, which also changes the size of the receiving space. It is conceivable that the container holder is only moved translationally in order to change the size of the receiving space. The change in the shape or geometry of the shell surface of the container holder can be made in addition to or as an alternative to the translatory movement. For example, the actuator is connected to the container holder via at least one mechanical coupling element (pressure or traction elements such as a linkage or ropes, etc.) and/or a gear so that a movement of the actuator can be transmitted to the container holder and/or the shell surface of the container holder. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a receiving cup, the receiving cup being movably connected to the container holder so that the receiving cup and the container holder can be moved relative to each other, and the receiving space for coffee beans is defined by the receiving cup, the container holder, and the closing device when in the closed state. The container holder and the receiving cup are telescopically interlocked, for example. Thus, the container holder can be moved translationally with respect to the receiving cup and thereby change the receiving space. When the coffee beans have entered the receiving space, the closing device is closed so that no further coffee beans can flow out of the coffee bean container and an outlet opening of the receiving cup is opened to guide the coffee beans out of the receiving space to the grinder. The receiving cup is optional and not mandatory to determine the amount of coffee beans. If the dead spaces in the grinder and the volume of the container holder below the closing device are known, then the receiving space can also be determined from the shape and/or position of the container holder, because the beans flowing into the receiving space are initially accumulated below by the grinding disks of the grinder. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a strainer and a tamper, and the strainer is arranged to collect ground coffee from the grinder and the tamper is arranged to apply a compressive force to the ground coffee in the strainer and to cause a homogeneous surface, distribution and thickness of the ground coffee in the strainer. The strainer can be arranged below the grinder so that the ground coffee falls directly into the strainer after grinding and is collected therein. Following the grinding process, the ground coffee is evenly distributed in the strainer by means of the tamper. The tamper may contain a plunger or a plate and is pressed onto the ground coffee in the strainer with a predetermined force. During the grinding process, the tamper is stowed in a parking position in the housing of the coffee machine. After the grinding process, the tamper is extended from the parking position and brought over the strainer. Now the tamper can be placed on the ground coffee in the strainer with a predefined force. The coffee machine can have an actuator that causes the movements of the tamper. The function of the tamper can alternatively also be fulfilled with an impeller. The impeller is located between the grinder and the sieve and rotates during the grinding process. This rotation distributes the ground coffee in the strainer. After the grinding process, the impeller is moved in the direction of the strainer and sits on the ground coffee, distributing it evenly in the strainer. It is also conceivable that the ground coffee is mixed and evenly distributed by air turbulence after the grinding process and during falling. To achieve this, however, vibrations can also be applied to the strainer as an alternative or in addition. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine is designed to be operated selectively with one coffee bean container of a plurality of exchangeable coffee bean containers. Basically, a coffee bean container placed in the container holder is in the closed state, i.e., no coffee beans fall into the grinder or the coffee machine. Coffee beans are released from the coffee bean container by opening the closing device only when required. The quantity of coffee beans released is then used to prepare a coffee drink. This means that no coffee beans remain in the grinder or in the feed to the grinder. Between the preparation of two coffee drinks, the coffee bean container can be changed, and the newly inserted coffee bean container can contain different coffee beans (different types, different degree of roasting, generally beans with a different odor and taste profile). However, it is ensured that the beans from different coffee bean containers do not mix in the coffee machine. Referring to the detection device described above, this can be an optical detection unit (e.g., a scanner) or a radio wave receiver (e.g., a so-called NFC or RFID receiver). The detection device detects either an optical identification of the coffee bean container or an electromagnetic identifier and, depending on the identifier, sets the coffee machine parameters, e.g., the time duration of the open state of the closing device or the size of the receiving space, for the coffee beans from the respective coffee bean container. If the coffee bean container is changed, the coffee machine adjusts to the new coffee bean container. For example, the detection device can read only one coffee bean container identifier and set the coffee machine parameters (size of the receiving space, flow profile of the water, temperature of the water, water pressure, etc., see also the description below) depending on this identifier, for example based on a table of setting values. The coffee bean container identifier may be, for example, a number, an alphanumeric string, or any other string that uniquely identifies a coffee bean container or the coffee beans contained in the coffee bean container to enable the coffee machine to apply the coffee machine parameter setting intended for those coffee beans. Alternatively, the coffee machine can be designed to read in a set of parameters for setting the coffee machine via the detection device. This second approach has the advantage that a separate table with setting values does not have to be kept available and that the setting values of the coffee machine can be specified completely anew with each coffee bean container, regardless of whether the existing table with setting values has an entry for a specific coffee bean container. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a water reservoir, the water reservoir comprising a housing and a piston movable therein, the piston being drivable by an actuator to move within the housing and, upon or through such movement, to force a fluid therein out of the housing through an outlet opening. The water reservoir may be designed to hold water for a single brew or portion of coffee drink. The actuator moves the piston in the water reservoir and pushes the water from the housing through the ground coffee in the strainer. Thereby the coffee drink is prepared. The actuator can cause a predetermined movement profile or flow profile of the water. For example, the flow rate per time can be specified in detail and the actuator moves the piston to achieve this flow rate. The housing can also have a water inlet for refilling the water reservoir with water after a coffee drink production process. The piston can be driven electromechanically or hydraulically. The flow rate and the flow volume of the water through the ground coffee can be specified via the path of the piston or its movement over time. The movement or position of the piston can be sensed by one or more sensors, which can be located on the piston or on the actuator. The water pressure can be determined from the mechanical load of the piston, for which a sensor can also be used. The mechanical load of the piston can be used as a manipulated variable for the pressure-flow profile, as described below. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include at least one heating element arranged at the water reservoir and configured to heat the fluid in the water reservoir to a predetermined temperature. The heating element is in particular an electrical heating element and is arranged, for example, on the walls of the housing. The heating element can also be arranged in the water reservoir, but care must be taken that the heating element does not impede the movement of the piston. According to a further embodiment, the coffee machine further may include a first sensor and/or a second sensor, and the first sensor is configured to detect a flow profile of the fluid at the outlet opening of the housing of the water reservoir, and the second sensor is configured to detect a force applied by the actuator to the piston. The flow profile of the fluid forced out of the water reservoir allows conclusions to be drawn about how the fluid flows through the ground coffee in the strainer. The coffee machine has a closed fluid circuit, so that this conclusion is readily permissible. In any case, this flow profile detected by the first sensor can be compared with an expected flow profile. If the sensed flow profile deviates from the expected flow profile, a control unit can vary the actuator and the force applied to the fluid to arrive at a target flow profile of the fluid through the ground coffee. The reason for monitoring the flow profile of the fluid is that the flow profile of water through the ground coffee also affects the taste of the coffee drink. Thus, the taste of the coffee drink can be improved if the appropriate flow profile (corresponding in particular to the flow rate over time) is set. The second sensor monitors the force applied to the piston, which in turn corresponds to the water pressure. The values detected by this sensor can also be compared with a setpoint and the actuator can be controlled accordingly so that the water pressure corresponds to a pre-settable setpoint (which can be different for each type of coffee bean or for each coffee drink). The coffee machine has a control unit that is connected to the sensors and the detection device and can receive data from these sensors. Based on the data received from the sensors and the detection device for coffee bean containers, the control unit sends commands to the actuator to set the size of the receiving space (or the time period after which the closing device is moved from the open state to the closed state, i.e., in general terms, to set the amount of coffee beans or ground coffee for a single coffee drink preparation process), to the grinder to set the grind level for the coffee beans, to the water reservoir to set the temperature, the flow profile, and the water pressure. The parameters described herein can also be referred to as preparation parameters. The preparation parameters include, on the one hand, so-called brew parameters, which refer to the immediate brewing process of the coffee drink, and, on the other hand, the quantity and degree of grinding of the ground coffee. For example, the amount of ground coffee used refers to its weight, regardless of how this weight is adjusted, e.g., by the size of the receiving space for coffee beans before the grinding process or the weight of the beans or the period of time the closing device is open. The brew parameters refer to the temperature of the water or a temperature curve, the flow profile of the water (amount of water per time), and a pressure profile of the water (pressure curve over time) during the brewing process. In other words, the coffee machine is parameterized and set based on the identification of the coffee bean container. Manual adjustment of the coffee machine is no longer necessary, because the coffee machine is automatically adjusted to the parameters determined by the manufacturer or supplier of the coffee beans and recorded in the identification of the coffee bean container. A consistent taste and optimum extraction level (as the proportion of dissolved substances from the coffee bean) of the coffee drink produced in this way can thus be achieved. The control unit of the coffee machine can measure the brew parameters mentioned and record them for each individual preparation process. It may be that certain brew parameters deviate from the specification during the preparation process. If the actual prevailing brew parameters are measured (using the sensors referred to herein), a deviation from the predetermined brew parameters may be detected. For example, it may be the case that a flow profile and a pressure profile of the water deviate from the default. This may indicate that the water pressure is too high, which may result in a lower quality coffee drink as it affects the extraction of flavor. The control unit can be designed to compare the measured brew parameters with the predefined brew parameters (as specified by the identification element on the coffee bean container). In case of a deviation between measurement and default by a predetermined threshold value, the control unit can apply a correction value to the default in order to adjust the brew parameters. Such an adjustment can also be made when a user initiates an adjustment by an input at the coffee machine. In one embodiment, the coffee machine may be configured to record a pressure profile of the water during the brewing process according to a recipe. The recipe specifies, for example, a flow rate (amount of water per time). An expected pressure profile for the time during the brewing process is stored for this recipe and the specified flow rate. If the recorded pressure profile deviates from the expected pressure profile, this may indicate a need for adjustment of the specified brew parameters. In the example given here, the flow rate according to the recipe could then be increased or decreased. This adjustment can be made by the control unit of a coffee machine if the control unit detects a deviation between the recorded and expected values. In a recipe, for example, the flow rate can be specified and the pressure profile is measured and compared with an expected pressure profile. However, it is also conceivable that in a recipe the pressure profile is predetermined and the flow rate is measured and compared with an expected flow rate. The expected pressure profile or the expected flow rate from a recipe are, for example, predetermined values based on experience or based on taste sensory feedback. The expected pressure profile or flow rate are sized to correspond to a high quality coffee drink. In one embodiment, the control unit may be designed to vary the brew parameters depending on the measured pressure profile and/or flow profile. In one embodiment, the control unit may be configured to vary the brew parameters depending on coffee bean characteristics. The coffee bean properties in this sense include, for example, the origin, the roasting temperature and/or flavor attributes, which are stored on the identification element. The identification element can, for example, contain identification values for the respective coffee bean properties. The coffee machine can have an input/output unit or an operating element that enables a person to interact with the coffee machine and influence the brew parameters, among other things. The operating element can, for example, be attached to a housing of the coffee machine and be designed as a display with an input function. For example, inputs can be made via switches, buttons or rotary knobs. Alternatively, the display can be designed as a touch-sensitive display via which a person can make direct inputs. In this way, the quality of the coffee drink can be improved by training the control unit on the brew parameters and user inputs. For this purpose, the control unit uses data collected by the machine for each brewing process (the above-mentioned brew parameters, in particular the flow and pressure profiles, but possibly also the water quantity and/or temperature profiles, and optionally also the other preparation parameters such as degree of grind and coffee powder quantity). Preferably, at least the maximum brewing pressure and/or the pressure and flow rate curve (flow and pressure profiles) of the measured preparation process are used as parameters for evaluating a preparation process. In addition, the temperature curve can be determined and used. The data of the preparation process are used to readjust the initial parameters and to achieve an optimal preparation process in terms of pressure and flow curves. If, in addition, the bean properties (such as place of origin and roasting temperature, etc.) are linked to the measured brew parameters, new beans can be automatically adjusted to the best parameters by the control unit, for example by using the brew parameters of those beans whose bean properties most closely match the new beans. The sensor data determined by the machine serve as the basis for training the control unit. The control unit can be designed to output predictions of the flavor profiles of the brewed coffee based on the growing conditions, growing region and planned processing of the coffee beans. Feedback from the user about the taste of the coffee can be used to link the bean characteristics to specific taste sensory characteristics. An algorithm trained on this data can make a prediction about the taste of the coffee based only on the bean characteristics (growing region, roasting temperature, etc.). Input parameters for this function are at least one bean property (which can be read from the identification of the coffee bean container) and the necessary measurement parameter is the user input about the taste sensory perception. The control unit can adapt existing recipes (i.e., the preparation parameters) to a desired taste of a user. The control unit can also make a prediction or recommendation of coffee beans or their origin or processing, based on a taste profile of the user. For this purpose, the control unit compares the input about the taste sensory perception of the user with the bean characteristics of the beans used and estimates in which direction the user has changed the taste by the input. Through this estimation, the control unit can determine which beans have an appropriate flavor profile and then recommend those beans for consumption. Following a similar mechanism, the control unit can recommend beans of a particular growing region or processing. According to another aspect, an arrangement comprising a plurality of coffee machines described herein is disclosed. The plurality of coffee machines are communicatively connected to a central unit such that the coffee machines can transmit data to or receive data from the central unit. For example, the coffee machines are connected to the central unit via a data network or data link. A memory with recipes can be kept in the central unit, with the recipes each containing the preparation parameters for a specific type of bean. In this way, it is possible to supply the coffee machines centrally with the recipes. Conversely, it is also possible for the coffee machines to transmit the measured values recorded by the sensors and belonging to a specific bean type (in particular the brew parameters) to the central unit. In this way, the central unit can evaluate whether or not the specified brew parameters match the specific bean type. If it is determined that the specified brew parameters cause an undesirable behavior (an unsuitable flow profile or an unsuitable pressure curve), the recipe for the specific bean type can be changed and distributed to the coffee machines. The central unit can adjust the brew parameters in the same way as the local control unit, whereby the central unit uses measured values from a plurality of coffee machines. The measured values recorded by the sensors of the multiple coffee machines are transmitted to the central unit. In the central unit, the recorded measured values are then compared with the expected values for the respective parameter as assigned to a recipe (pressure profile of the water or flow rate of the water). If there is a discrepancy between the measured values and the expected values, the corresponding recipe can be adjusted in the central unit and communicated to the coffee machines, so that with the adjusted recipe the measured values correspond to the expected values. The basic idea here is that the control unit in the coffee machines regulates a manipulated variable as specified in the recipe (for example, the flow rate of the water in a first case or the pressure profile of the water in a second case) and that sensors in the coffee machines measure a test variable (for example, the pressure profile of the water in the first case or the flow rate of the water in the second case). The measured test variable is compared to an expected value for the test variable, and if there is a discrepancy, the recipe and its default manipulated variable are adjusted. This process may be implemented locally in each coffee machine using the locally measured values or the process may be implemented in the central unit using the measured values of a plurality of coffee machines. According to another aspect, a coffee bean container is disclosed. The coffee bean container may include a housing, an outlet and an identification element. The housing is configured to receive coffee beans. The outlet is arranged to discharge coffee beans from the housing. The identification element is machine readable and contains an instruction for setting parameters of a coffee machine for preparing a coffee drink with the coffee beans from the housing. The identification element is configured to preset a first parameter of the coffee machine, and the first parameter is configured to instruct an actuator to move a closing device on a container holder of the coffee machine or on the coffee bean container from an open state to a closed state and vice versa and to move the closing device from the open state to the closed state after an adjustable period of time, thereby presetting a quantity of coffee beans to be fed to the grinder. The coffee bean container is configured to interact with the coffee machine described herein. The identification element is optically or electromagnetically readable as described in connection with the coffee machine. The coffee bean container thus includes a prescription for setting the coffee machine to produce a coffee drink with the coffee beans contained therein. The identification element can be a character string, as described above, which acts as an identifier and enables the coffee machine to apply the setting parameters assigned to this character string. Alternatively, the identification element can contain the setting parameters. The outlet of the coffee bean container is configured to be coupled to the coffee bean container receiving arrangement or the container holder of the coffee machine. According to a further embodiment, the coffee bean container further may include a locking element arranged to releasably lock the outlet to a container holder of a coffee machine. The locking element can be designed as a pin, hook, or eye, for example. The locking element interacts with a counterpart on the container holder and serves to lock the coffee bean container to the container holder of the coffee machine. This locking can be made and released without tools, for example by placing the coffee bean container on the container holder in such a way that the locking element engages in a locking groove of the container holder. From this position, the coffee bean container can be rotated or locked into a locked position. According to a further embodiment, the coffee bean container further may include a closure, and the closure is arranged to selectively open or close the outlet of the coffee bean container, and the closure is arranged to transition from a closed state to an open state when the coffee bean container is connected to a container holder of a coffee machine. When the coffee bean container is not inserted in the coffee machine, the closure closes the housing and protects the coffee beans contained therein. When the coffee bean container is inserted into the coffee machine, the closure is moved to the open position and allows the coffee beans to enter the receiving space of the container holder when its closing device is also in the open state. When the coffee bean container is removed from the container holder, the closure of the coffee bean container is placed in the closed state. The closure can be designed, for example, as a central closure or lamella closure, in which closure plates are pushed radially in front of the outlet opening of the coffee bean container and thus close it. When the coffee bean container is inserted into the container holder of the coffee machine, the outlet opening of the coffee bean container is released by the closure opening during this insertion movement. In this state, no coffee beans enter the receiving space. After the coffee bean container has been inserted into the container holder, the coffee machine recognizes this and reads the identification of the coffee bean container. The coffee machine is then set according to the transferred parameters. Now, a coffee drink can be prepared. First, the closing device of the container holder opens, lets coffee beans into the receiving space, closes the receiving space with the locking device and then prepares the coffee drink as described above. Now, the coffee bean container can be changed (causing a new coffee machine setting procedure; in general, the parameters are applied to the coffee machine when a coffee bean container is inserted into the container holder) or another coffee drink can be prepared with the same coffee bean container. According to a further aspect, a system for preparing coffee drinks is disclosed. The system may include one or more coffee bean containers as described herein and a coffee machine as described herein. The system enables the coffee machine to be used for the fresh preparation of coffee drinks based on freshly ground coffee beans with several different coffee bean containers (and different coffee beans or types of coffee beans contained therein), whereby the coffee bean containers can be inserted selectively, and the coffee machine parameterizes itself depending on the parameterization specifications on the identification element of the coffee bean container. In general, it is conceivable in connection with the coffee machine and the system that a user of the coffee machine deviates from the predefined parameters for setting the coffee machine. Although the coffee machine sets these parameters, a user may permanently or temporarily change the predetermined parameters for a particular type of coffee and thus, for example, train (parameterize) for a new type of coffee bean. For this purpose, the coffee machine may include a data memory that stores the user-specific parameterization for a particular identifier of a coffee bean container. When the coffee machine reads this identifier from the identification element, the parameters from the data memory can then be applied directly. For this purpose, this data memory can optionally be arranged in a decentralized manner, in which case the data memory can be accessed via a data network. Such a central data memory can be updated from a central location, for example by centrally adjusting the parameters to a particular coffee bean variety, for example by changing existing parameters to a coffee bean variety or offering a parameter set to a new coffee bean variety. The central data memory can be contacted and read out each time the coffee machine parameters are adjusted, in order to apply the read-out parameters to the respective coffee machine in a decentralized manner, or the data memory can serve as a source for distributing updated parameters to the coffee machines, so that the parameters are kept in the coffee machines in a decentralized manner after the update process. Furthermore, the coffee bean container can be hermetically sealed with the container holder so that the coffee beans are kept in as inert an atmosphere as possible when the coffee bean container is inserted into the container holder. Of course, the coffee bean container can be detached from the container holder after each preparation of a coffee drink, whereby the closure closes the outlet opening of the coffee bean container and thus protects the coffee beans. Several such systems can be connected to each other via a data network (e.g., via the Internet or a private data network) and transmit information about the coffee machines' parameters to a central data repository. This allows alternative parameters for a coffee bean type to be transmitted, allowing other users to use the same parameter set. In the following, a coffee machine or parts thereof are described according to further aspects. Each aspect includes several variants, and references from one variant to another variant are to be understood as referring to variants of the same aspect. Aspect 2—Strainer for Coffee Machine and Coffee Machine with Strainer Aspect 2, initial variant (variant 0): a strainer for a coffee machine, for example a so-called portafilter machine, the strainer comprising a first coating arranged to provide thermal insulation between the strainer and a strainer support of the coffee machine. The coffee machine according to aspect 2, initial variant may be a coffee machine as described herein. However, the coffee machine may also be a machine that does not have, or only partially has, the other features described herein. In other words, such a strainer may be used in any portafilter machine for preparing hot beverages, such as coffee drinks. For example, the grinder, the closing device on the container holder or the coffee bean container along with associated actuator, and the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and the coffee bean container may be omitted for the functions described in aspect 2. In aspect 2, the detection device can also be omitted. The strainer support is an element that holds or supports the strainer in its predetermined position. Aspect 2, Variant 1: the strainer according to the initial variant, in which the first coating is disposed on an outer surface of the strainer. A strainer can be described in general terms as a container and has, for example, a substantially U-shaped profile. This container has a base area and an interior space as well as lateral walls. In the base area there are openings which allow the function of a strainer. In the case of coffee drink preparation, the strainer contains ground coffee through which hot water is forced. The water absorbs substances from the ground coffee and flows through the openings in the base area of the strainer into a vessel. Aspect 2, Variant 2: the strainer according to the initial variant or Variant 1, in which the first coating covers or overlies a portion or all of the outer surface of the strainer. The strainer is usually held by a support. The support can also be referred to as the strainer support. The first coating may be arranged on the strainer in such a way that the transfer of thermal energy from the strainer to the support is reduced. It is conceivable that the first coating is arranged on the strainer in such a way that the first coating on the outer surface is only arranged at those points or surfaces where the strainer is in contact (i.e., in mechanical contact) with the support. Then the first coating ensures that the flow of thermal energy (i.e., thermal conduction) between the strainer and the support is reduced at precisely these points. Alternatively, the entire outer surface of the strainer can be coated with the thermally insulating first coating. The outer surface of the strainer is in particular that surface which runs along one or more lateral walls and/or a shoulder of the strainer and faces away from the interior space of the strainer. The outer surface of the lateral walls and/or a shoulder, which holds the strainer on the support, are usually in mechanical contact with the support at least in sections. The thermally insulating first coating at these positions ensures that the outflow of thermal energy from the strainer to the support is reduced. In one variant, the strainer can also have a thermally insulating coating on the entire outer surface, i.e., also where the outer surface of the strainer is not in mechanical contact with the support or another element of the coffee machine. By thermally insulating the strainer also on those sections of the outer surface that are only in contact with the ambient air, a loss of thermal energy through convection can also be reduced. For example, the base area of the strainer on the side facing away from the interior space can also be coated with the first coating. The first coating on the entire or partial outer surface of the strainer helps to reduce the dissipation of thermal energy from the strainer. It is also conceivable that a ceramic coating is applied to an interior surface of the strainer, such as to the entire interior surface. The strainer may, for example, consist of a metallic base material provided with the first coating. This has the advantage of improving the energy efficiency of the coffee machine without negatively affecting the quality of the prepared beverage. An important point for the quality of prepared coffee drinks is, among other things, the temperature stability of the water during the preparation of the coffee drink, especially while the water is in contact with the ground coffee. This temperature stability can be realized on the one hand by a high thermal mass of the strainer and the support in contact with it, which are preheated to an appropriate temperature and kept at this temperature. In order to reduce the energy required for heating the strainer and the support, it is proposed in this aspect that the strainer is thermally isolated from the support to reduce the energy required while still maintaining a constant brewing temperature of the water. This thermal insulation can be realized, for example, by a ceramic first coating of the strainer. The insulation reduces the thermal mass, which should have a constant temperature, to that of the strainer. The support is thermally separated or isolated from the strainer. Aspect 2, Variant 3: the strainer according to any of the previous variants of aspect 2, in which the first coating is a ceramic coating. Ceramic is an inorganic non-metallic material and has low thermal conductivity combined with high mechanical strength. For example, aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) can be used. The thickness of the first coating can be varied depending on the application and expected temperature differences between the strainer and the support. For example, the first coating can be a few tenths of a millimeter up to one millimeter thick. Aspect 2, Variant 4: The strainer according to any of the preceding variants of aspect 2, further comprising a second coating, in which the second coating covers or overlays a portion or all of an interior surface of the screen. The second coating may have non-stick properties. This has the advantage that the ground coffee does not adhere to the strainer or its interior surface after preparation of a coffee drink or detaches more easily therefrom. The second coating may contain or consist of a fluoropolymer, for example polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). However, the second coating can also be based on ceramics (i.e., contain or consist of ceramics) and have a smooth surface, which also provides good anti-adhesion properties. Aspect 2, Variant 5: a coffee machine having a strainer support and having a strainer according to any of the previous variants of Aspect 2. The strainer is detachable from the strainer support. When the strainer is removed from the strainer support, the interior space of the strainer can be filled with ground coffee. After the ground coffee has been prepared for the preparation of a coffee drink, the strainer is inserted into the strainer support and the preparation process is started. For the purpose of this variant, strainer support means any holder for holding the strainer during a preparation process of a coffee drink or other hot beverage. Aspect 2, Variant 6: The coffee machine of Variant 5, in which a holding surface of the strainer support may include a thermally insulating coating. This thermally insulating coating can be of the same type as the coating on the outer surface of the strainer. The strainer support may be coated with the first coating on those surfaces that are in mechanical contact with the strainer. The strainer can contact the strainer support in the inserted state at one or more surfaces or punctually at several points. At these contact points or contact surfaces, the strainer and optionally the strainer support is coated with the thermally insulating first coating. The first coating on the strainer and optionally on the strainer support reduces the thermal flow from the strainer to the strainer support. Aspect 3—Networked Intelligent Coffee Machine Aspect 3, initial variant (variant 0): a coffee machine with a control unit and at least one sensor, in which the sensor is configured to detect a brew parameter during the preparation of a coffee drink and to transmit it to the control unit, and the control unit is configured to modify a recipe for the preparation of a coffee drink based on the detected brew parameter. With regard to the function of the control unit and the at least one sensor as well as the definition of the brew parameters, reference is made to the above description, in particular to the explanations regarding the manipulated variable and the test variable as well as to the adaptation of the recipe in case of deviations between a value of the measured test variable and a value of the expected test variable. The coffee machine may comprise more than one sensor. The control unit is designed to modify the parameters contained in the recipe for the preparation of a coffee drink based on the detected brew parameters (for example flow profile, pressure curve, etc.) if the detected brew parameters indicate a lower quality of the coffee drink. Aspect 3, Variant 1: the coffee machine according to the initial variant, the coffee machine may include an input/output unit configured to receive an input from a user. The user's input concerns, for example, taste sensory parameters of a prepared coffee drink. The taste sensory parameters are transmitted to the control unit. The control unit is designed to use the taste sensory parameters to vary the brew parameters of a recipe. Aspect 3, Variant 2: The coffee machine according to any one of the previous variants, further comprising an interface for establishing a connection to a data network, and the coffee machine is adapted to be communicatively connected to a central unit such that the coffee machine can send data to and/or receive data from the central unit. For example, the interface can be designed to establish a wireless connection (e.g., WiFi, IEEE 802.11 protocol family) to an access point of a data network. However, the interface can also be designed for a wired connection (Ethernet or other standards). The coffee machine is usually connected indirectly to the central unit via this interface, i.e., the connection between the coffee machine and the central unit is established via an intermediate data network. For the variants of aspect 3, reference is made to the corresponding description elsewhere in this document with respect to the sensors and the brew parameters. The brew parameters specified in a recipe and the brew parameters measured by the sensors are also used in aspect 3 as they are reproduced elsewhere in this description. Aspect 3, Variant 3: an arrangement comprising a plurality of coffee machines according to any one of the preceding variants and at least one central unit, in which each one of the plurality of coffee machines is connected to a central unit such that data can be exchanged between the respective coffee machine and the central unit in at least one direction. It is conceivable that some coffee machines only send data in the direction of the central unit, but do not receive any data. Conversely, it is also conceivable that some coffee machines do not send any data in the direction of the central unit, but only receive or retrieve data from the central unit. The data exchange between the coffee machine and the central unit can, for example, be a setting option specified by a user of the coffee machine. The data exchange between a coffee machine and the central unit can be based on a so-called push or pull mechanism, i.e., the data sink retrieves data (pull) or the data source sends data on its own (push). The input device of a coffee machine can be designed in such a way that a user can order accessories or coffee beans by means of the input device via a predefined input mask. For this purpose, the coffee machine may suggest to the user a bean type that corresponds to the taste sensory profiles preferred by this user. In the central unit, the transmitted measured brew parameters can be used to adjust a recipe of a specific bean type. This can be helpful, for example, if it is determined for a recipe that the specified brew parameters lead to an undesirable time curve of the measured brew parameters. In aspect 3, the coffee machine may be a coffee machine according to any of the other aspects described herein. However, it may also be a coffee machine with a different range of functions. For example, the grinder, the closing device on the container holder or the coffee bean container including the associated actuator, the coffee bean container receiving arrangement and the coffee bean container may be omitted for the functions described in aspect 3. Optionally, the detection device may also be omitted if a recipe with the predetermined brew parameters for the preparation of a coffee drink is selected in another way, for example via the input device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows a system 10 comprising a coffee bean container 100 and a coffee machine 200 . The coffee bean container 100 may include a housing 110 , an outlet 120 with a closure 125 and a locking element 127 , and an identification element 130 . The coffee machine 200 may include a housing 210 , a control unit 220 , a grinder 230 and a coffee bean container receiving arrangement 240 . Furthermore, the coffee machine 200 may include a detection device 205 . In this example, the detection device 205 is arranged at the housing 210 . In particular, the detection device 205 is positioned to read the identification element 130 of the coffee bean container 100 when the coffee bean container 100 is coupled to the coffee bean container receiving arrangement 240 . The grinder 230 may include one or more grinding disks 232 . Between the grinding disks 232 there is a free space 234 into which the coffee beans are inserted before the grinding process begins. The grinder 230 is adjustable via an actuator, for example via the actuator 245 , by varying the distance between the grinding disks 232 . The coffee bean container receiving arrangement 240 includes a container holder 241 and a receiving cup 244 . The container holder 241 is movable relative to the receiving cup 244 , for example, by the actuator 245 moving the container holder 241 up or down. This movement varies the size of the receiving space 246 , which is the interior space of the container holder 241 and receiving cup 244 . The container holder 241 has a locking groove 242 . The coffee bean container 100 is placed on the container holder 241 with the outlet 120 so that the locking element 127 engages in the locking groove 242 . The coffee bean container 100 is then rotated to a locked position. During this rotational movement, the closure 125 of the outlet 120 is opened so that coffee beans can pass from the coffee bean container 100 into the receiving space 246 . With respect to the coffee bean container 100 , it is conceivable that the housing 110 is rotatable with respect to the outlet 120 to open the closure 125 upon this relative movement between the housing 110 and the outlet 120 . When the coffee bean container 100 is coupled to the container holder 241 , there is first a first rotational movement that locks the locking element 127 in the locking groove 242 . Subsequently, the housing 110 of the coffee bean container 100 may be rotated in the same direction, and during this subsequent rotational movement, a portion of the outlet 120 is no longer rotated, such that this second movement opens the closure 125 of the outlet 120 . However, the closure 125 can also be opened in other ways, for example by a lever or other opening element arranged on the housing 110 . Removing the coffee bean container 100 performs these steps in reverse order: first, the housing 110 is rotated with respect to the outlet 120 to close the outlet 120 with the closure 125 , then the locking element 127 in the locking groove 242 is released and the coffee bean container 100 can be removed. The container holder 241 may include a closing device 243 . The closing device 243 opens or closes the access to the receiving space 246 . The closing device 243 is actuated by the actuator 245 . The receiving space 246 is filled with coffee beans in a quantity that is intended for preparing a portion of a coffee drink. For this purpose, the actuator 245 adjusts the size of the receiving space 246 , in the example of FIG. 1 by moving the container holder 241 up or down. Then, the closing device 243 is moved, for example by a lateral sliding movement, and coffee beans enter the receiving space 246 . The amount of coffee beans in the receiving space 246 is limited by the receiving space 246 being full. Then, the closing device 243 is moved to the closed position. Subsequently, the coffee beans are fed from the receiving space 246 to the grinder 230 , for example, by releasing an outlet opening 247 of the receiving cup 244 . The outlet opening 247 can be selectively opened or closed with a closing device (not shown, similar to the closing device 243 at the inlet of the receiving space 246 ). Since the closing device 243 is in the closed position, no further coffee beans flow through the inlet opening 248 into the receiving space 246 or the grinder 230 and the coffee beans are portioned for this brewing operation as specified. Once all coffee beans have been ground, outlet opening 247 is closed again and the process for making a coffee drink can be repeated. The receiving cup 244 may also be omitted. Without the receiving cup 244 , the receiving space 246 of the container holder 241 is extended by a free space 234 in the grinder 230 . When the closing device 243 is opened, coffee beans flow into the receiving space 246 and the free space 234 . Provided that the free space 234 and its size are known, the size of the receiving space 246 can be adjusted by moving the container holder 241 . Before the next coffee drink is produced, the coffee bean container 100 can be changed. If a coffee bean container 100 with a different coffee bean type is used, the coffee machine 200 detects the identification element 130 of the new coffee bean container 100 by means of the detection device 205 and sets the coffee machine to the new coffee bean type. In summary, FIG. 1 describes a coffee machine 200 , a coffee bean container 100 , and a system 10 comprising a coffee machine 200 and a coffee bean container 100 . The coffee bean container 100 includes an identification element 130 that is read by the coffee machine 200 when the coffee bean container 100 is placed on the coffee machine 200 . Based on the information read out from the identification element 130 , a set of parameters (the so-called preparation parameters) is applied to the coffee machine and the coffee machine is individually set for the placed coffee bean container. Various actuators are provided which can set the following parameters: amount of coffee beans (by setting the size of the receiving space with a corresponding actuator), grinding degree (by setting the grinder), flow profile, pressure, amount of water (by controlling the actuator of the water reservoir), temperature of the water (controlling the heating element on the water reservoir). The settings are applied by the control unit 220 of the coffee machine by transmitting corresponding setting commands from the control unit 220 to the respective actuators or the heating elements. Although FIG. 1 shows a container holder 241 with a closing device 243 , the closing device 243 may also be part of the coffee bean container. The closing device can be a flap or a slider at the outlet opening of the coffee bean container. An actuator of the coffee machine including a lever or linkage may act on the closing device and thereby release said opening of the coffee bean container so that coffee beans fall by gravity from the coffee bean container into the grinder or a feed to the grinder. The design of the coffee bean container 100 and the coffee machine 200 described here is characterized in particular by the fact that the coffee bean container 100 can be changed after each preparation process of a portion of coffee drink and that no unground coffee beans of the previous coffee bean type are in the grinder. The coffee machine 200 makes it possible to prepare coffee drinks based on freshly ground coffee and still change the coffee bean type after each individual production process of a portion of coffee drink. The control unit 220 may be a programmed controller connected to the detection device 205 and the actuator 245 . The control unit 220 receives information from the detection device 205 about the identification 130 of the coffee bean container 100 and, based on this information, generates control commands that instruct the actuator 245 to adjust the coffee machine 200 accordingly. The actuator 245 is shown by way of example only. It is to be understood that the coffee machine may include one or more actuators 245 , each actuator arranged to set a parameter of the coffee machine or to perform a function. The functions to be performed are: moving the closing device 243 from the open state to the closed state and vice versa; the same function is also implemented for releasing or closing the outlet opening 247 ; adjusting the grinding degree of the grinder 230 ; varying the size of the receiving space 246 . Further functions are described with reference to the following figures and are mentioned here only for completeness: distributing and compacting ground coffee in a strainer; dispensing water from a water reservoir; heating water in the water reservoir. The control unit 220 is configured to instruct one or more actuators to execute the above functions according to a specification corresponding to the identification of a coffee bean container to adjust the coffee machine as specified. FIG. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the coffee machine 200 with housing 210 , grinder 230 , tamper 250 and strainer 260 . When the coffee beans are ground in the grinder 230 , the resulting ground coffee falls onto the strainer 260 . In this state, the ground coffee may be unevenly distributed in the strainer. The tamper 250 is now used to evenly distribute and compact the ground coffee in the strainer. The tamper 250 may be positioned in a recess of the housing 210 during the grinding process, and is extended from this recess and returned to its position above the strainer 260 when the grinding process is complete. The tamper 260 may be a planar piston or an impeller. The tamper 260 exerts a force on and distributes ground coffee located in the strainer 270 . Now a heated fluid, for example water, can be forced through the ground coffee in the strainer 260 . FIG. 3 shows a water reservoir 270 with a housing 271 in which water 276 is stored. A piston 273 is arranged in the housing, which can be moved in the housing by an actuator 275 and a rod 274 . When the piston 273 is moved in the housing 271 , the water 276 is forced through the outlet opening 277 . A hose or pipe (not shown) is arranged at the outlet opening 277 and brings the water to the ground coffee in the strainer 260 (see FIG. 2 ). The actuator 275 is also controlled by the control unit 220 to cause a desired flow profile and pressure of the water 276 through the outlet opening 277 . The flow profile of the water and the pressure of the water is determined by the identification of the coffee bean container used. Heating elements 272 are arranged at the water reservoir 270 to bring the water 276 to a desired temperature. This temperature can also be specified by the identification of the coffee bean container used. For example, the water reservoir 270 has a holding capacity for water to make one serving of coffee drink. After the manufacturing process, the piston 273 is pulled away from the outlet opening 277 by the actuator 275 . At this point, new water is introduced into the water reservoir 270 , for example via an inlet opening (not shown separately) arranged in the wall of the housing 271 . FIG. 4 shows the control unit 220 and a first sensor 280 and a second sensor 290 associated therewith. The first sensor 280 may be arranged on the coffee machine 200 to sense a flow profile of water forced out of the water reservoir 270 . The second sensor 290 may be arranged on the piston 273 or the actuator 275 to sense a movement or resistance of the piston 273 or the actuator 275 , respectively. Both the flow profile of the water and the resistance to movement of the piston 273 or actuator 275 can be used by the control unit 220 to determine how the water flows through the ground coffee contained in the strainer 260 . The flow profile and the pressure of the water affect the taste of the coffee drink. Both may be predetermined for the particular coffee bean container 100 via the identification element 130 on the coffee bean container 100 . If the flow profile and/or the pressure of the water deviates from these specifications, the control unit 220 can control the actuator 275 at the water reservoir 270 in such a way that these values adapt to the specifications. FIG. 5 shows a coffee machine 200 A. This can be the coffee machine from the preceding embodiments or a coffee machine that does not implement or only partially implements the features described in FIGS. 1 to 4 . The coffee machine 200 A includes a support 252 . The support 252 has an opening configured to receive the strainer 260 to enable preparation of a coffee drink. In the state shown in FIG. 5 , the strainer at 160 is located in the support 252 . In this state, heated or hot water is forced through ground coffee (not shown) located in the interior space 262 . The water exits the interior space 262 through openings located in the base area 261 of the strainer 260 (not shown). The strainer 260 has a substantially U-shaped profile with a base area 261 , one or more lateral walls 265 , and one or more shoulders 266 . The lateral walls 265 together with the base area 261 form the interior space 262 . The shoulder 266 rests on the support 252 in the inserted state and holds the strainer 260 in position. In the example shown in FIG. 5 , various surfaces of the strainer 260 abut the support 252 . To reduce the amount of thermal energy transferred from the strainer to the support, an outer surface 263 of the lateral wall 265 is coated with a first coating 264 . The first coating 264 is configured to be thermally insulating. For example, the first coating 264 is disposed on the outer surface of the lateral wall and on the underside of the shoulder. Generally speaking, the first coating 264 is disposed at the contact surfaces or contact points between the strainer 260 and the support 252 . The interior surface 267 of the screen 260 is coated with a second coating 268 . The second coating serves to prevent adhesion of ground coffee after the preparation process of a coffee drink or to reduce the extent thereof. The second coating 267 is arranged, for example, on the interior surface of the lateral wall 265 and on the base area 261 , and in particular extends over the entire interior surface of the strainer 260 . The second coating 267 may also extend to the surface of the shoulder 266 . FIG. 6 shows an arrangement 1 with a plurality of coffee machines 200 B and a central unit 5 . The coffee machines 200 B are communicatively connected to the central unit 5 via a data network or a data link, so that data can be exchanged bidirectionally between each individual coffee machine and the central unit. For example, a coffee machine from a household may be connected wireless or in a wired manner to an access node to the Internet (or another data network). The Internet (or another data network) establishes the connection to the remotely located central unit 5 . The central unit 5 may provide selected individual or all coffee machines with information, such as new recipes or changes to existing recipes. The central unit 5 may, for example, be designed as a computer or a computer arrangement to have sufficient computing power and transmission capacity to handle a connection to a high number of coffee machines. Each coffee machine 200 B has a control unit 220 which, on the one hand, applies the preparation parameters for a coffee drink and, on the other hand, receives measured values from a plurality of sensors distributed in the coffee machine (for example, the first sensor 280 and the second sensor 290 as well as further sensors as described herein), and the measured values in particular relate to the brew parameters. In addition, each coffee machine 200 B includes an input/output unit or operating element 225 through which a user of the coffee machine can provide taste sensing input to a prepared coffee drink. The control unit 220 receives both the measured values and the taste sensor inputs and transmits them to the central unit 5 . The central unit 5 can also be configured to provide the preparation parameters to a coffee machine based on a read-out identification element 130 of the coffee bean container. For example, if a coffee bean container 100 is inserted into the coffee machine 200 B and the identification element is read out, the coffee machine can retrieve the recipe with preparation parameters belonging to this identification element from the central unit 5 . This means that it is not necessary for the recipe to be stored locally on the identification element or in the coffee machine. If the recipe is stored centrally and is retrieved as needed, a revision of the recipe will find its way to the individual coffee machines at an early stage. For example, the recipe can be retrieved by a coffee machine from the central unit whenever a coffee bean container is newly inserted or changed in said coffee machine. It is conceivable that the coffee machine has a memory which holds a fixed or variable number of most recently used recipes, whereby a recipe stored in this memory is provided with a time stamp, for example, and is deleted after a predeterminable period of time. However, a recipe can also be deleted from the memory if there is a need for storage space for more recently used recipes. Additionally, it should be noted that “comprising” or “consisting” does not exclude other elements or steps, and “one” or “a” does not exclude a plurality. It should further be noted that features or steps that have been described with reference to any of the above embodiments may also be used in combination with other features or steps of other embodiments described above. Reference signs in the claims are not to be regarded as a limitation.

The compositions of the invention comprise processed coffee grounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The art includes numerous methods directed toward enhancing the flavor of instant coffee, brewed coffee and coffee extracts. With respect to brewed coffee and coffee extracts, these methods typically attempt to achieve this goal without sacrificing the desirable yields and conveniences associated with conventional high temperature (generally at least about 65° C. (149° F.)) coffee extraction. It is generally recognized that high temperature coffee extraction is convenient and economical to the end user, but that flavor is often compromised. That is, end users (both at home consumers and those in an industrial setting) prefer the convenience of conventional brewing appliances, which use high temperature extraction. It follows, then, that to be of appeal to consumers or to industry, methods of enhancing flavor must do so without sacrificing convenience. Additionally, the methods must provide these attributes while being economical to the end user. Selective extraction is one general approach to improving the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extract. According to this approach, a preferred ratio of bad to good coffee flavors are extracted from roasted and ground coffee. Ideally, this selective extraction improves the overall flavor of brewed coffees or coffee extracts without compromising its flavor strength or extraction yield. Two well known selective extraction methods are low temperature extraction and selective extraction via adsorbents. Although both methods are known to improve coffee flavor, it is also recognized that each method has serious deficiencies. For example, low temperature extraction generally provides lower yields than high temperature extraction. Unlike low temperature extraction, adsorbents accommodate high temperature conditions and also preferably adsorb a favorable ratio of bad flavor components to good flavor components without sacrificing yield and convenience. Adsorbents used in roasted and ground coffee include activated carbons (i.e., activated charcoals), carbohydrates and carbohydrate polymers (e.g., alginic acid), synthetic polyamides, insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, certain mineral substances (e.g. aluminum oxides, silica gel), amidated cellulose materials (e.g., chitosan, chitan), and proteinaceous materials (e.g. gelatin, zein). These prior art adsorbents have been used in various ways to improve the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extracts. Some have been added to extraction columns in industry, to the extract from extraction columns, to packaged roasted and ground coffee marketed for consumer use, or to the structure of coffee filters used in conventional brewing devices. These adsorbents improve the flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extract by either adsorbing (and therefore removing) a favorable ratio of bad flavor components to good flavor components, or by adsorbing good flavor components during storage and releasing them upon extraction. In spite of the flavor improvements, adsorbents described in the prior art are typically expensive and may pass into the final coffee beverage, thereby providing negative mouth feel character.

No. 5,328,708, Rizzi et al. describe a process for removing lipids from spent coffee grounds so they comprise less than 2% lipids, whereupon they are suitable for use as an adsorbent for bitter coffee flavors and burnt coffee aromas. The removal of lipids is accomplished via organic solvent extraction using lipophilic solvents, such as ethanol, methanol, chloroform, hexane and ethyl acetate. Although this method is known to improve coffee flavor, it is also recognized that the method has deficiencies. For example, it is well recognized in the industry that the use of organic solvent systems is not only very capital intensive, but can be problematic when dealing with solvent reclamation, safety, and environmental issues. These problems can be further compounded when dealing with multiple solvent systems. Not only are special precautions necessary when using these solvents, it is also recognized that volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from such solvents are tightly regulated by the U.S. government. Applicants have discovered that, surprisingly, spent coffee grounds can be rendered useful as adsorbents for improving flavor of brewed coffee or coffee extracts without the removal of lipids. The use of organic solvents is therefore unnecessary for providing the processed coffee grounds of the present invention. Because lipids are not removed from the starting spent coffee grounds to arrive at the improved processed coffee grounds, the processed grounds comprise greater than 2% lipids. The improved processed coffee grounds may allow lower usage levels in coffee compositions while achieving desirable removal of off coffee flavors. While prior art methods have utilized adsorbents to enhance the flavor of coffee, there is a continuing need for improved adsorbents to further enhance brewed coffee flavor. Applicants' use of spent grounds processed in accordance with the description below provides coffee flavor benefits, while also utilizing a material that is otherwise of limited, if any, value. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a composition for preparing fresh brewed coffee beverages wherein the composition comprises processed coffee grounds (PCGs) that are described herein. In particular, the composition comprises processed coffee grounds and roasted and ground coffee. The invention is further directed to a process for making a composition of the present invention, the process comprising combining roasted and ground coffee and PCGs in a ratio of from about 200:1 to about 10:1. The invention is still further directed to a process for making brewed coffee, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention with water to generate a brewed coffee; and (ii) collecting the brewed coffee for subsequent consumption. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a coffee concentrate, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention with water to generate a coffee concentrate; and (ii) collecting the concentrate for eventual packaging for sale to a consumer. The invention is still further directed to a process for making soluble coffee, comprising contacting a coffee extract with processed coffee grounds described herein. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION I. Definitions: The term “brewed coffee” means a coffee beverage obtained by aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee using conventional brewing devices (e.g., percolators, electric percolators, drip coffee makers, automatic drip coffee makers). Use herein of the term “brewed coffee beverage” refers to a liquid beverage that is intended for consumption without further processing, other than manipulation by the end consumer (e.g., addition of flavors, creams, sweeteners, or the like). The term “coffee concentrate” means a liquid coffee extract, or a dried product of the extract, obtained by aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, wherein such extract is further processed (e.g., diluted) prior to consumption. The term “coffee extract” means a liquid extract of roasted and ground coffee, or a dried product of the extract, obtained during the manufacture of soluble (i.e., instant) coffee. As used herein, the term “coffee extract” refers to an “intermediate” liquid or solid that is subsequently processed and eventually dried to provide soluble (instant) coffee particles. The term “comprising” means that the various components, ingredients, or steps can be conjointly employed in practicing the present invention. Accordingly, the term “comprising” encompasses the more restrictive terms “consisting essentially of” and “consisting of”. The term “high temperature extraction” means aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, the water temperature exceeding about 65° C. (149° F.). The term “instant coffee beverage” means a coffee beverage obtained by dissolving soluble (i.e., instant) coffee particles in a liquid medium, typically heated water. The terms “instant” and “soluble” are used interchangeably herein. The term “low temperature extraction” means aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee, the water temperature being not more than about 65° C. (149° F.). The term or symbols for “percent” refers to weight-weight percent, unless otherwise indicated. The term “processed coffee grounds” or “PCGs” means the residue of coffee grounds remaining after an aqueous extraction of roasted and ground coffee. Because lipids are not removed from the starting spent coffee grounds to obtain the PCGs used herein, the PCGs will comprise greater than 2% lipids. Typically the PCGs will comprise at least about 5% lipids, more typically at least about 10% lipids and still more typically at least about 15% lipids. Reference herein to ratios is on a weight-weight basis, unless otherwise specified. II. PCGs, Compositions and Processes According to the present invention, it has now been found that the processed coffee grounds described herein function as an inexpensive adsorbent that selectively reduces burnt coffee flavors, bitter coffee flavors, or modulates the flavor characteristic of coffee (e.g., reduces acidity) without contaminating the coffee beverage or sacrificing coffee yield. When PCGs are added to roasted and ground coffee particles, the resulting composition can be extracted by conventional water (typically hot water) methods to produce an improved brewed coffee, coffee concentrate or coffee extract. The following describes in more detail the PCGs useful herein, compositions containing PCGs and processes for making the compositions, and processes for brewing coffee and making soluble coffee using the PCGs. A. PCGs As mentioned, Applicants have discovered that the functional adsorbent quality of spent coffee grounds is directly proportional to the extent to which they have been extracted with water, up to a point where they have reached their maximum potential. Spent coffee grounds taken directly from a coffee brewer and dried may not exhibit an adsorbent quality in a coffee composition to be sensorially perceptible. For these grounds to demonstrate functional absorbency (and to therefore function as PCGs per the present invention), they may need to be further processed with additional water extractions. This is because the extraction conditions don't allow for sufficient removal of the otherwise extractable components. In contrast, coffee grounds resulting from the manufacture of soluble coffee will typically require no additional extraction to function as PCGs, although some degree of additional processing (e.g., drying, as discussed below) may be necessary to optimize their functionality. It is well recognized to those skilled in the art that the extent the roasted and ground particles are extracted is contingent upon the method of extraction (e.g., batch or multiple batch versus continuous, static or mixed bed, co-current versus counter-current), specific equipment selection, extraction efficiencies, time, temperatures utilized, and the like. It would be easily recognized by those skilled in the art that the degree of extraction chosen will be based on the desired adsorbency effect and economics, realizing that at some point further extraction will eventually bring diminishing returns. It has been further discovered that these water extractions will induce the adsorbent functionality of the grounds in the presence of any lipids naturally present within or on the surface of the grounds. Further, it has been found that coffee grounds that have been first decaffeinated using known processes to those skilled in the art, prior to water extraction(s), will also exhibit adsorbent functionality. Surprisingly, it has been found that although there is a high lipid level within the spent coffee grounds, off flavors normally associated with lipid oxidation by-products, do not occur when the PCGs are dried under mild conditions and are then fresh packaged. Because the starting spent coffee grounds are not subjected to extraction by lipophilic solvents as described in the Rizzi patent, the PCGs will comprise greater than 2%, by total weight, lipids, and typically significantly higher lipid levels. The PCGs will typically comprise at least about 5% lipids, more typically at least about 10% lipids and still more typically at least about 15% lipids. Typically, the PCGs will comprise from about 5% to about 20% lipids. The lipid content of the PCGs is measured using Method Number 920.39 as described in “Official Methods of Analysis” of The Association of Official Analytical Chemists. This method is described in detail in the Test Methods section below. The average particle size of the PCG particles will preferably range from about 20 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Series to about 200 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Series, although particle sizes outside this range would also be acceptable. Within this range, particle size has little impact on the efficacy of the PCGs. When derived from a soluble coffee manufacturing process, the dried PCGs may be larger granules than a 20 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve. These larger granules can be further comminuted to granules consistent with typical roasted and ground products without affecting the adsorbent functionality of the PCGs. Various types of grinders known in the industry can be used for this purpose. As PCG particle size varies within the above range, surface area also varies but efficacy as an adsorbent for bad coffee flavors appears to remain substantially unchanged. PCGs are extracted (and typically dried) coffee grounds that are known to contain approximately 10-15% protein. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, since some prior art adsorbents used in coffee brewing contain a large protein component, it is believed that the processing of the PCGs removes components already adsorbed to these proteins within the grounds. Once removed, and placed in contact with an aqueous extraction medium, these proteins are available to re-adsorb negative flavored components, thus reducing/removing them from the resulting brewed coffee, coffee concentrate or coffee extract. PCGs can be derived from low, intermediate or high quality coffee beans, or blends thereof. In order to maximize the economic benefit of using “spent” grounds, preferred are low quality coffees or blends containing low quality coffee. Non-limiting examples of low quality beans include robustas, low grade naturals such as Haiti XXX, Peru Natural, Salvadors, low grade Brazils, and low grade unwashed Arabicas such as the Ugandas, Indonesians, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Equador, Resacas and Guatemalan TMS. PCGs can be derived from any coffee source, but for economic reasons are preferably derived as a by-product of soluble coffee manufacturing. PCGs contain less than about 1% soluble coffee solids. PCGs therefore make a plentiful, inexpensive material for inclusion in coffee compositions. Soluble coffees are usually produced by counter current extraction mechanisms well known to those skilled in the art. Typically, an aqueous extraction medium at temperatures from about 65° C. (149° F.) to about 175° C. (330° F.) passes through a series of extraction columns filled with roasted and ground coffee with fresh aqueous extraction medium starting at the column with the most extracted roasted and ground coffee, moving sequentially through the series of columns, and eventually through the last column of fresh roasted and ground coffee. The extract is then collected, a new column of fresh roasted and ground coffee is added to the end of the column sequence, and the first column is discarded as spent coffee grounds. The spent coffee grounds are released from the extraction column by opening the hot, pressurized column and blowing the pressurized grounds into a holding vessel. These grounds can subsequently be processed to provide PCGs as described herein. Many variations of the counter current method have been described, as well as non-counter current methods of manufacturing soluble coffee, all of which provide an acceptable source of PCGs for the present invention. PCGs contain a large lipid component that can be oxidized, increasing the likelihood of developing an adsorbent aftertaste on the eventual product of the invention. Accordingly, although PCGs may be functional in a wet state, it is desirable to avoid the oxidation of any lipids during further processing of the coffee grounds. It is also important that the PCGs be microbially stable. Accordingly, it may be preferable to dry the PCGs prior to further processing. For example, mild drying conditions can be employed in drying the PCGs to achieve this goal. In one preferred embodiment, for example where the PCGs are combined with roasted and ground coffee, the PCGs will have a moisture content of less than about 10%. The method for measuring moisture content is described in the Test Method section below. PCGs being porous granules can be dried in a variety of ways, including but not limited to convective drying, forced air drying, fluidized bed drying, vacuum drying, infrared drying, or microwave drying. Indeed, any conventional drying process that does not subject the PCGs to temperatures or for extended lengths of time that would degrade the PCG structure or the components making up the PCG structure or promote oxidation, or other chemical degradation, can be used. Fluidized bed drying is preferred due to its milder temperatures and speed of drying so as to minimize lipid oxidation, as well as its reduced complexity and economics. The newly manufactured and dried PCGs appear as a customary granular coffee, which is substantially odorless and tasteless. As mentioned, PCGs are derived from any source, but preferably are derived as a by-product of soluble coffee manufacturing. B. Compositions and Processes PCGs are added to roasted and ground coffee to form the composition of the current invention. The PCGs and roasted and ground coffee can be combined by conventional dry mixing methods. As a matter of convenience in manufacture, the PCGs can be added to whole bean roasted coffee prior to grinding and ground simultaneously. This is particularly useful when the PCGs are of larger particle size than is customary for retail roasted and ground products. (For example, when the PCGs are derived from a soluble coffee manufacturing process.) The simultaneous grinding has the further advantage of providing intermixing resulting in a more homogeneous coffee blend. The weight ratio of roasted and ground coffee to PCGs will typically be from about 10:1 to about 200:1, more typically from about 30:1 to about 170:1, still more typically from about 65:1 to about 133:1. A composition with a ratio greater than 200:1 typically will provide an insignificant benefit from the PCGs, and a composition with a ratio less than 10:1 typically will produce a weak coffee with some adsorbent aftertaste. Of course, these general parameters will be dictated by the relative adsorbent capacity of the PCGs utilized, which is impacted by various factors as discussed above. Accordingly, the ranges provided herein are not meant to limit the scope of the appended claims. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention will comprise roasted and ground coffee, PCGs and soluble coffee. In one such embodiment, this composition is useful in a product similar to the Folger's Singles® product (marketed by the Procter & Gamble Company), which provides an “instant”, one cup coffee preparation. The beverage is generated by steeping a water permeable packet containing the PCGs, the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee particles. Examples of coffee-containing packets are well known in the literature. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 1,454,739 to C. B. Holland et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,531,594 to L. H. Abrams et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,183,096 to E. F. Hiscock et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,640,727 to M. R. Heusinkveld, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In those embodiments where instant coffee is included with the PCGs and the roasted and ground coffee, the instant coffee particles can be prepared by any convenient process. A variety of such processes are known to those skilled in the art. Conventionally, instant coffee is prepared by roasting and grinding a blend of coffee beans, extracting the roasted and ground coffee with water to form an aqueous coffee extract, and drying the extract to form “instant coffee.” Typical roasting equipment and methods for roasting coffee beans are described, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 1, pp. 203-226. Typical oil expelling equipment is described, for example, in Sivetz, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 2, pp. 27-30; typical grinding equipment is described, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, supra, pp. 239-250. Typical disclosures of equipment and methods which can be used for extracting coffee include: U.S. Pat. No. 2,562,206 to Nutting et al., Sivetz & Foote, supra, pp. 261-378; and U.S. Pat. No. 2,515,730 to Omfelt et al. Typical disclosures of spray drying processes which can be used to prepare instant coffee particles can be found, for example, in Sivetz & Foote, COFFEE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, Avi Publishing Co., Westport, Conn., 1963, Vol. 1, pp. 382-513; U.S. Pat. No. 2,771,343 to Chase et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,750,998 to Moore, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,469,553 to Hall. The instant coffee component can be any one of the commercially available instant coffees sold on the market, or combinations thereof. These include spray dried instant coffee powders, agglomerates and freeze-dried chunks. Examples of instant coffees useful herein include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,436,227 to Bergeron et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,493,388 to Hair, U.S. Pat. No. 3,615,669 to Hair et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,620,756 to Strobel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,637,397 to Menzies et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,293 to Lombana et al. The instant coffee used may be any single variety of coffee or a blend of different varieties. The instant coffee component may be regular or decaffeinated. The instant coffee may optionally be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic such as expresso, French roast, or the like. The roasted and ground coffee can be derived from low, intermediate or high quality coffee beans, or blends thereof. The roasted and ground coffee can be either decaffeinated or non-decaffeinated. PCGs can be added to straight or blended coffees of various degrees of roast. PCG usage level is determined by the effect desired. For example, for a blend of coffees where one component is roasted darker for a requisite flavor but incurs an increase in bitterness, PCGs can be added at higher levels to offset or minimize the increased bitterness. Low quality roasted and ground coffee beans have an undesirable or excessive bitter flavor that can be reduced by PCGs. Some lower quality coffee beans may also have a rather strong characteristic flavor that can become a flavor negative when used at too high of levels within a blend of coffees, i.e., the characteristic flavor becomes too dominant. PCGs can be added at a level to achieve the desired effect of modulating this characteristic flavor. Non-limiting examples of low quality beans include robustas, low grade naturals such as Haiti XXX, Peru Natural, Salvadors, low grade Brazils, and low grade unwashed Arabicas, such as the Ugandas, Indonesians, Ivory Coast, Dominican Republic, Equador, Resacas and Guatemalan TMS. Processes for making decaffeinated and non-decaffeinated roasted and ground coffee are well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,935 to Kirkpatrick et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,573 to Stefanucci et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,821 to Morrison et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,262 to Wolfson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,671,263 to Patel et al., the disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference. Likewise, the composition of the invention can also be used by consumers to make a brewed coffee having a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. The coffee composition can be packaged the same as a conventional roasted and ground coffee for the consumer market. The composition does not leave an unpleasant adsorbent aftertaste in the brewed coffee and, most importantly, consumers can obtain the flavor benefit of the invention by conventional brewing methods—hot water extraction using conventional consumer brewing devices (e.g., percolators, electric percolators, drip coffee makers, automatic drip coffee makers). In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a process for making a composition of the present invention, the process comprising combining roasted and ground coffee and PCGs in a ratio of from about 200:1 to about 10:1. As discussed above, the PCGs can be combined with the roasted and ground coffee particles either after the roasted particles are ground, or during the grinding process itself. The PCGs can be combined with the roasted and ground particles to form a relatively homogeneous blend. Such a homogeneous blend is preferred when the product is to be sold as a bulk brewed coffee product (e.g., sold in traditional cans). Alternatively, the PCGs and roasted and ground coffee can be combined in a heterogeneous manner (e.g., two distinct layers). Such a heterogeneous blend would be useful where the coffee components are to be sold in a packet for brewing in a drip coffee maker. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a coffee concentrate, the process comprising (i) contacting a composition of the present invention (i.e., containing PCGs) with water to generate a coffee concentrate; and (ii) collecting the concentrate for eventual packaging for distribution to a consumer. In the water extraction step, the water is preferably heated to a temperature of at least about 65° C. (149° F.). According to this process, the resulting coffee concentrate is in either liquid or solid form. The concentrate is then packaged for eventual distribution, where some additional processing (e.g., dilution) is required to provide a consumable beverage. The invention is still further directed to a process for making soluble coffee comprising contacting a coffee extract with PCGs described herein. In one embodiment for making soluble coffee, the PCGs and roast and ground coffee are added to counter current extraction columns so as to produce a coffee extract with a modulated flavor having reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. In an alternative embodiment, a coffee extract (e.g., derived from roast and ground hot temperature extraction) containing from about 5% to about 25% soluble coffee solids is first devolatilized by stripping away the flavor compounds. Then it is concentrated, preferably to from about 30% to about 50% soluble coffee solids, using methods commonly known to those skilled in the art. This concentrated extract is then contacted with PCGs prior to adding back flavor compounds and spray drying. Alternatively, a soluble coffee extract (e.g., derived from roasted and ground hot temperature extraction) is contacted with PCGs after first removing the volatile components. Then the devolatilized PCG-treated coffee extract is subject to a concentration process, the volatile compounds are added back and then dried. Yet another alternative is to devolatilize the initial coffee extract, then concentrate it to from about 30% to about 50% coffee solids, then add back the volatiles and then contact the complete mixture with PCGs before spray drying. The invention is still further directed to a process for making a brewed coffee beverage, the process comprising (i) contacting a roasted and ground coffee and PCGs with water to generate a brewed coffee; and (ii) collecting the brewed coffee for subsequent consumption. This process is most typically carried out using conventional drip coffee makers. In this process, a preferred embodiment is where the composition is subjected to high temperature extraction in step (i). In one embodiment, the roasted and ground coffee and the PCGs are combined in a single composition prior to being contacted with water. Alternatively, the roasted and ground coffee and the PCGs may be separate when contacted by the water. (For example, the two may be in separate compartments of a single package.) III. Test Methods—Moisture Content; Water Activity; and Lipid Content The moisture content of the PCGs is determined by a gravimetric method similar to Method Number 931.04 as described in the Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15 th Edition, 1990. A 10 g sample of the wet processed grounds is accurately weighed in an aluminum pan and dried to constant weight at 100° C. in an oven with air circulation. The water activity (ratio of vapor pressure of water in product to vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature) of the PCGs is determined by a method similar to Method Number 978.18, ibid. Here a Rotronic hygroscop® water activity meter made by Rotronic AG, Grindelstrasse 6, CH-8303 Bassersdorf, Switzerland, equipped with a WA40-TH constant temperature measuring cell, is used. Crude lipid content of the PCGs is determined by exhaustive extraction of the lipids based on Method Number 920.39 as described in the Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15 th Edition, 1990. Any one of the solvents—petroleum ether, hexane, chloroform, diethylether and methanol, or a combination thereof—can be used as the extraction solvent. IV. EXAMPLES Example 1 Roasted and ground coffee is further processed to provide functional benefits in a coffee matrix by the following batch preparation. 40 g of Folgers® French-Roast roasted and ground coffee is added to a Bunn™ model OL-35 commercial coffee machine's filter basket containing a paper coffee filter. The brew button is depressed and the coffee is automatically extracted in the typical manner. Upon completion, the soluble portion is discarded and the insoluble coffee grounds are obtained and transferred to a 4 L beaker. For the first extraction, these coffee grounds are further processed by addition of 1700 mL of distilled and deionized water. The contents are stirred using a large spatula to suspend the grounds, and then allowed to stand for several minutes to allow the coffee grounds to settle. Approximately ⅓ of the bulk liquid is then decanted off to remove the fines that have remained in suspension. The remaining grounds are once again resuspended in the remaining liquid by stirring with a spatula, and are immediately poured into a coffee basket that is supported by a stand and that contains a fresh coffee filter. The filtrate is allowed to drain and is discarded. The coffee grounds are again transferred to a clean 4-liter beaker. For the second extraction, 1700 mL of water is added and the procedure is repeated for a total of six extractions. After the sixth extraction, these further processed grounds are transferred from the filter paper and spread out in a 10-inch aluminum pie pan, for drying. The pan is placed in a Blue M™ Stabil-Therm fan-forced laboratory convection oven Model ESP-401C, held at 60° C. for 18 hours, then allowed to cool to room temperature. These further processed coffee grounds remain physically, microbially, and chemically stable when packaged in accordance with customary roasted and ground coffee products. The water activity of these processed coffee grounds is less than 0.85a w @25° C. and the moisture content is less than 9.72%. Example 2 A 2.5 g (5%) sample of the processed coffee grounds from Example 1 is put into a quart-size glass jar followed by 50 g of Folgers® French-Roast roasted and ground coffee. The jar is capped and shaken to mix the contents. The admixed coffee is placed into a Bunn™ model OL-35 commercial coffee machine's filter basket containing a paper coffee filter. The brew button is depressed and the coffee is automatically brewed in the typical manner. The resulting brewed coffee is less bitter, and has less off-flavor than a control coffee made in the same manner but omitting the dried processed coffee grounds. Example 3 A small slit is cut into Folgers® Singles coffee bag (sold by The Procter & Gamble Company) using an X-acto knife and 0.25 g (nominally 5%) of the processed coffee grounds from Example 1 is introduced into the coffee bag, containing nominally 4.42 g of a blend of ground and concentrated coffees. The bag is re-sealed using a Sealboy™ thermal package sealer type 235 SA from Packaging Aids Corporation with a sealing time set to 10. The bag is added to an eight ounce Styrofoam™ cup, boiling water is added and the contents are allowed to brew for 60 seconds. The bag is then dunked up and down for 30 seconds whereupon the bag is withdrawn from the beverage and discarded. The resulting beverage is less bitter and has a reduced coffee concentrate flavor as compared to a Folgers® Singles control made in a similar manner but without the processed coffee grounds. Example 4 Roasted and ground coffee can be further processed on a commercial scale to provide the functional benefits in a coffee matrix, using known commercial processes. Roasted and ground coffee is added to a battery of commercial percolation extractors known and used in the industry for preparation of soluble coffee extract, as described in Coffee Technology, Vol. 2, Chapter 5, Edited by R. J. Clarke and R.Macrae© (Elsevier Applied Science Publishers LTD (1987). The number of extraction columns in such batteries typically ranges from five to eight. These grounds can be made functional by processing as described, following the industrial practice of using higher feed water temperatures, up to 180° C. in a countercurrent fashion with the roasted coffee, i.e., the most exhausted coffee being contacted first. Typically the temperature of the liquor and grounds is then reduced to around 100° C. by the time the freshest grounds are contacted. The soluble extract from such processing can be subsequently dried as instant coffee. The remaining processed coffee grounds are removed from their respective columns and conveyed to a screw-press, known and used in the industry to effectively remove bulk water. The mechanical forces imposed on the coffee grounds by the screw-press reduces the moisture content from about 98% to about a 56%. The damp grounds are conveyed to a fluidized bed drier, and dried to a final moisture level of less than 9.72% with a water activity of less than 0.85a w @25° C. Drying conditions for a 6-inch static bed height of coffee grounds and an 18 to 20 minute residence time can be accomplished with an air inlet temperature of 86.10° C. and an air flux of 1.25 kg/m 2 /s. These dried grounds are physically, microbially, and chemically stable and can be transferred to appropriate storage facilities such as a silo, or they can be immediately packaged. Coffee grounds processed in this manner provide the intended functional benefit, when added to and packaged with customary roasted and ground coffee products, or when used on a commercial scale in the manufacture of instant-coffee or liquid coffee concentrates. Example 5 A coffee blend is prepared by mixing 10 g (30%) roasted and ground Arabican variety coffee beans with 23.3 g (70%) roasted and ground Robusta variety coffee beans. To this mixture (33.3 g) is added an additional 0.17 g (0.5%) of the processed coffee grounds from Example 4, and the mixture is blended well. The coffee mix is added to a Mr. Coffee™ model PRX23 0898 retail coffee brewer's basket containing a paper coffee filter and is brewed with 1420 mL of distilled and deionized water and a coffee beverage (designated as Coffee Beverage A) is obtained. Another coffee beverage (designated as Coffee Beverage B) is prepared from a 33.3 g of coffee blend comprising 50% roasted and ground Arabican variety coffee beans with 50% roasted and ground Robusta variety coffee beans. Coffee Beverage A, brewed with the dried processed coffee grounds, has a less bitter aftertaste, is a little more balanced, with slightly less strength as compared to Coffee Beverage B. Example 6 An instant coffee or coffee concentrate is prepared on a commercial scale using known commercial processes, by the addition of PCGs in the coffee matrix. A blend comprising roasted and ground coffee and 1.5% PCGs from Example 4 are added to a battery of commercial percolation extractors known and used in the industry for preparation of soluble coffee extract, as described in Coffee Technology, Vol 2, Chapter 5, Edited by R. J. Clarke and R.Macrae©, Elsevier Applied Science Publishers LTD (1987). The number of extraction columns in such batteries typically range from five to eight. Following industrial practices, the columns are operated in a counter-current mode, i.e., the most exhausted coffee in the extraction battery is contacted first with higher feed water temperatures, up to 180° C. Typically the temperature of the liquor and grounds is then reduced to around 100° C. by the time the freshest grounds are contacted. The liquid coffee extract concentrate, resulting from such processing and the starting coffee blend, will have a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors. This liquid extract can be further concentrated if desired using known processes to remove bulk water, to produce a liquid coffee concentrate for commerce. Alternatively, the liquid coffee concentrate can be subsequently dried as an improved instant coffee having a modulated flavor with reduced negative flavors, and/or reduced burnt flavors, and/or reduced bitter flavors.","6783791"

No. 10/845,742, filed May 14, 2004, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/471,926, filed May 19, 2003. This invention relates generally to improvements in devices and systems for brewing coffee or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved coffee brewer utilizing streams of heated water for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds, to yield brewed coffee having improved flavor and enhanced aroma and other characteristics. Drip-style coffee brewers are available in a wide range of different configurations and sizes for use in residential or commercial environments to produce brewed coffee. Such coffee brewers commonly include a water reservoir from which a controlled volume of water is heated and then dispensed downwardly by dripping or spraying onto coffee grounds contained within an underlying, upwardly open brew basket. The hot water intermixes with the coffee grounds to produce the desired brewed coffee beverage which is drained from the brew basket through a filter element into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In one common form, the brewer includes a refillable water reservoir from which the water is delivered through a heating element for drip-flow dispensing into the brew basket. Alternately, the brewer may be coupled directly to a tap water supply or the like. While drip-style coffee brewers of the above described type have been used extensively for many years, the flavor and other characteristics of the brewed coffee is inconsistent and, in many cases, can be of marginal or unacceptable quality. Such problems are believed to stem from inadequate and/or inconsistent intermixing of the hot water with the coffee grounds contained in the brew basket, resulting in brewed coffee exhibiting inconsistent flavor and body traits, often including unacceptable bitter taste attributes. In this regard, the downward dispensing of hot water onto the initially dry coffee grounds in the underlying brew basket can produce erosion-type channels through the coffee grounds, wherein such channels can permit a significant portion of the water volume to pass through the coffee grounds and drip from the brew basket without significantly wetting or otherwise adequately intermixing therewith. While this channeling problem can sometimes be mitigated by carefully pre-distributing the coffee grounds substantially uniformly within the brew basket, significant attention to this aspect of the coffee brewing process is seldom given. A variety of modified coffee brewers and related brewing processes have been provided in an attempt to overcome these problems and disadvantages by providing improved intermixing between the heated water and the coffee grounds within a filtered brew basket. In general, such concepts utilize mechanical stirring devices for improving thorough contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds. While such concepts may provide brewed coffee with enhanced and/or more consistent flavor characteristics, they inherently incorporate moving parts that increase the overall complexity and cost of the coffee brewer, and are susceptible to occasional break-down to require periodic repair or replacement. There exists, therefore, a continuing need for further improvements in and to coffee brewers and related coffee brewing processes for achieving significantly improved intermixing between heated water and coffee grounds, for providing brewed coffee of consistent high quality and improved flavor and other desirable attributes, without requiring mechanical stirring devices and their attendant disadvantages. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, an improved coffee brewer and brewing method are provided for producing brewed coffee with improved flavor. The coffee brewer includes a removably mounted brew basket having jet ports connected to a source of heated water and positioned to deliver hot water streams into the brew basket at a location for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds contained therein to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds for improved flavor extraction. This fluidized bed is directed against one or more mesh filter elements forming a wall portion of the brew basket for outward passage of the thus-produced coffee which is then directed into an underlying carafe or the like. In one preferred form, the coffee brewer includes a water reservoir coupled via a first check valve for flow in heat transfer relation with a heating unit. The heating unit elevates the temperature of the water substantially to the boiling point, whereupon the heated water flows through a second check valve to the brew basket. The heated water flows to and through the jet ports into the interior of the brew basket, with at least some of the jet ports being disposed at a position beneath the level of coffee grounds contained therein. As a result, the heated water is jetted or sprayed into and thoroughly wets the coffee grounds with an agitating and stirring action that is effective to lift, suspend, and turbulently stir the grounds in a manner to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne grounds. In the preferred form, the jet ports are oriented for rotationally stirring the coffee grounds with a substantial spinning or orbital path of motion. The fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds provides improved and consistent intermixing of the heated water with the coffee grounds for enhanced flavor extraction with minimal bitter and/or other undesirable attributes. This spinning fluidized bed is directed by centrifugal action in a generally radially outward direction against an inboard side wall of the brew basket, a portion of which is defined by the mesh filter element or elements which permit outward flow-through passage of the brewed liquid coffee while substantially preventing outward passage of the coffee grounds. The brewed coffee passed through the filter element or elements is directed further as by gravity flow into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention, a frontal portion of the brew basket side wall comprises a substantially transparent window visible from the exterior of the coffee brewer, when the brew basket mounted is thereon. During a brewing cycle, the spinning fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket is thus externally observable. A light may be provided generally at or inclose proximity to the transparent window, for illuminating the visible brewing process. In a preferred form, the light such as an LED or the like is mounted onto the brewer for slide-fit reception into a pocket or recess formed in the brew basket generally at a lower margin of the basket window, when the brew basket is mounted onto the brewer. The region of the light pocket or recess, or the light itself, may be frosted for improved light dispersal and distribution across the window area. In the preferred form, the light is positioned in an at least slightly spaced relation from an inboard side of the basket window, thereby defining a chamber between the light and window through which a portion of the water-borne coffee grounds may circulate during a brew cycle, with such portion being back-illuminated by the light. The light is turned on at the initiation of the brew process, and may be adapted to turn off at the conclusion of the brew process thereby providing a visual indication that the brew process has been completed. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As shown in the exemplary drawings, an improved coffee brewer referred to generally in FIGS. 1-6 by the reference numeral 10 is provided for rapid and consistent high quality brewing of coffee. The coffee brewer 10 includes a brew basket 12 (FIGS. 4-10) for receiving a selected quantity of ground coffee (not shown). In accordance with a primary aspect of the invention, the brew basket 12 is adapted for connection to a source of heated water, and includes at least one and preferably a plurality of jet ports 14 (FIGS. 7 and 9- 11 ) positioned for agitating and turbulently stirring the coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of suspended and water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket 12 . This fluidized bed results in substantially improved and intimately thorough wetting contact and intermixing between the hot water and the coffee grounds, for achieving enhanced flavor extraction to consistently produce a high quality, fuller-bodied and more robust coffee beverage. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention is shown generally in one preferred form in FIGS. 1-6. As depicted, the coffee brewer 10 comprises a relatively compact base 16 having a platen 18 formed or carried thereon with a size and shape suitable for secure rested support of a coffee pot 20 such as a carafe or decanter or the like. An on-off button 22 is exposed at a front side of the base 16 and may be depressed manually when brewing of a pot of coffee is desired, as will be described in more detail. A power cord 24 (FIG.1) protrudes rearwardly from the base 16 for connecting the brewer 10 to a suitable electrical power source. A support post 26 extends upwardly from a rear side of the base 16 to support an upper brewer head 28 in a positioned generally cantilevered over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 supported on the base platen 18 . In general terms, the brewer head 28 comprises a relatively compact housing structure defining a water reservoir 30 (FIGS. 3-4) for receiving a selected volume of water for use in brewing a pot of coffee, in combination with an upwardly open cavity 32 (FIGS. 4-6) for removably supporting the brew basket 12 . Upon depression of the on-off button 22 , water within the reservoir 30 is delivered in heat exchange relation with a heating unit 34 shown mounted within the base 16 as viewed in FIG. 6, and further to the brewer basket jet ports 14 for delivery into the interior of the brew basket 12 in the form of a plurality of pressurized or jetted hot water streams. These hot water jets turbulently stir and intermix with coffee grounds contained within the brew basket 12 to produce the fluidized bed or suspension of coffee grounds within a spinning and swirling body of water within the brew basket, to produce the improved, high quality, and consistent coffee beverage in accordance with the invention. It is believed that the circulating particulate grounds produce an increased proportion of relatively microscopic fines due to abrading action during circulation. This coffee beverage is filtered and delivered from the brew basket to the underlying coffee pot or carafe 20 , ready for immediate use and enjoyment. In the filtered state, a substantial proportion of the small fines remain in the coffee beverage wherein such fines contribute to the rich coffee flavor. More particularly, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 3-6, the illustrative brewer head 28 includes an upper housing bowl 29 with an internal, generally vertically oriented divider wall 36 subdividing the brewer head 28 into the upwardly open water reservoir 30 occupying a rearward region of the head 28 , and the brewer basket cavity 32 at a forward region of the head 28 . A rear hinged lid 38 is provided on the brewer head 28 for normally closing the water reservoir 30 , but this lid 38 is adapted for quick and easy pivoting movement to an open position (as viewed in FIGS. 3-4) to permit a selected volume of water to be poured into the reservoir 30 . In a typical residential coffee maker, the reservoir 30 may be sized for receiving a standardized volume of water, such as a water volume sufficient to brew a standardized volume of coffee, such as 8, 10 or 12 cups. Alternately, the brewer head 28 may include volumetric gradation marks (not shown) indicating the volume of water contained therein, to facilitate brewing of different selected volumes of coffee. As a further alternative, persons skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the coffee brewer 10 may be connected directly to a tap water source or the like, in lieu of the reservoir 30 for pour-in reception of a selected water volume. The upper housing bowl 29 defining the water reservoir 30 is mounted on a lower housing shell 39 (shown best in FIGS. 5-6) which is supported at an upper end of the support post 26 in cantilevered relation spaced above the base 16 . Water within the reservoir 30 is coupled through a port 40 formed in a bottom wall of the upper bowl 29 (FIG. 6) to an underlying receiver 44 which is mounted on the lower shell 39 within a compartment 46 defined cooperatively between the upper bowl 29 and lower shell 39 . This receiver 44 may include a spring-loaded valve positioned for engagement by the upper bowl 29 for movement to an open position permitting downward water flow from the reservoir 30 , when the upper bowl 29 is mounted on the lower shell 39 . Such downward water flow proceeds through the receiver 44 and further through a short supply conduit 48 (FIGS. 5-6) which couples the water downflow to a passage 50 formed in the support post 26 and further to the heating unit 34 . A first check valve 45 (FIG. 6) is mounted along this passage 50 within the support post 26 to permit water downflow, but to prevent upward backflow from the heating unit 34 toward the reservoir 30 . The heating unit 34 , although depicted generally in FIG. 6 by dotted lines, comprises a standard dual pathway device of the type known in the art for use in coffee brewers. In particular, the heating unit 34 incorporates an electrical resistance heating element mounted within one annular pathway and disposed in heat transfer relation with water flow through an adjacent annular pathway. One exemplary dual pathway heating unit of this general type is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,956, which is incorporated by reference herein. With this construction, the water downflow through the post passage 50 is circulated though the water pathway of the heating unit 34 which heats the water substantially to boiling. A downstream end of the water pathway through the heating unit 34 is coupled to a second flow passage 52 (FIG. 6) for upward or return flow to the brewer head 28 . The upward return flow passage 52 through the support post 26 delivers the heated water through a short transition conduit 54 to an inverted, generally U-shaped turn 56 positioned within the water reservoir 30 and disposed at least slightly above a maximum fill level of the reservoir. This inverted and elevated conduit turn 56 prevents water within the reservoir 30 from draining past the turn 56 when the reservoir is filled with water. A downstream end of the inverted conduit turn 56 is coupled by an additional supply conduit 58 to a second check valve 60 mounted at the underside of the upper bowl 29 to permit one-way flow-through passage of water from the supply conduit 58 to brew basket 12 , but prevents backflow of water to the conduit 58 . More particularly, the second check valve 60 is positioned in aligned relation with an inflow port 62 (FIGS. 3 and 6) formed in the bottom wall of the upper housing bowl 29 , at a location generally centered within the brew basket cavity 32 . In this regard, as shown best in FIGS. 8 and 10, the brew basket 12 includes a downwardly open feed port 64 having a size and shape for seated reception on the underlying inflow port 62 , when the brew basket 12 is positioned within the brew cavity 32 . This feed port 64 communicates water inflow from the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 of the brew basket 12 . The brew basket 12 may comprise a generally bowl-shaped component constructed primarily from lightweight molded plastic or the like, to provide a generally upwardly open geometry defined by a bottom wall 66 joined to an upstanding side wall 68 of generally cylindrical configuration. The bottom wall 68 is formed to include the downwardly open feed port 64 for communicating hot water inflow upwardly into a false bottom or plenum chamber 70 (FIG. 10) which distributes the hot water flow to at least one and preferably a plurality of hollow ribs 72 formed in the side wall 68 . In the preferred configuration as shown, three of said hollow ribs 72 are formed in the side wall 68 at approximate 120° intervals, and each of these ribs 72 includes a closed upper end and has at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed along the height thereof for jetting hot water streams into the interior of the brew basket 12 . FIGS. 6-7 and 9 - 10 illustrate each hollow rib 72 with a pair of vertically spaced jet ports 14 positioned and aimed for jetting water streams generally tangentially in a common swirling direction (clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 9) into the brew basket interior. At least the lower jet ports 14 on the hollow ribs 72 are positioned at a level below a normal level or upper surface of a bed of dry coffee grounds placed into the brew basket 12 for brewing coffee, as indicated approximately by the dotted line 74 in FIG. 10. Thus, when the hot water is jetted through the jet ports 14 , at least a portion of the hot water stirs and agitates the body of coffee grounds to initiate a swirling or spinning action to create the fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. That is, upon initial supply of hot water into the brew basket 12 , water passing through the lower jets 14 stirs and agitates the initially dry coffee grounds, whereas the upper jets may be disposed above the upper surface of the coffee grounds and thereby initially spray onto and wet that upper surface. As hot water flow continues, the brew basket 12 gradually fills substantially with water, while the agitating and stirring action of the lower jets continues. As the brew basket fills with water, the water level eventually increases to a point higher than the upper jets 14 , as indicated approximately by the dotted line 76 in FIG. 10, whereby the upper and lower jets 14 cooperatively stir and agitate the combined body of coffee grounds and water to suspend and swirl the coffee grounds in the form of a water-borne fluidized dispersion. Such action exposes the entire volume of the coffee grounds to the heated water thoroughly and substantially uniformly, and for substantially for the entire period of the brew cycle, to result in a significantly improved and consistently high quality brewed coffee beverage. A removable cap 77 is normally provided to close the top of the brew basket 12 and thereby prevent undesired spilling of water or coffee grounds therefrom during the brewing procedure. In one preferred form as illustrated in FIG. 11, the jets ports 14 formed along the hollow ribs 72 of the brew basket 12 may be designed for minimizing or eliminating undesirable inflow or ingestion of particle-laden coffee when the supply of hot water to the jet ports 14 terminates. As shown in FIG. 11, each jet port 14 can be shaped to define a tapered profile with a cross sectional size that reduces toward a downstream or discharge end thereof, in combination with a filter screen 15 which can be formed as by in-place plastic molding generally at an upstream or inlet end of the jet port 14 . Upon supply of hot water to the jet port, the water passes freely through the filter screen 15 and then outwardly through the jet port 14 at a substantial velocity for intermixing with the coffee grounds within the brew basket. Upon cessation of the hot water flow, any particulate grounds which may flow or be drawn into the jet port 14 are collected on the downstream side of the filter screen 15 , where they cannot clog internal flow passages of the coffee maker apparatus. Instead, such collected grounds are retained on the screen 15 where they are hydraulically delivered back into the brew basket 12 during a subsequent brew cycle. Alternative structures for capturing ingested coffee grounds and/or for preventing backflow of such coffee grounds into and/or through the jet ports 14 will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. The thus-produced fluidized bed is swirled by centrifugal action against the inboard side of the brew basket side wall 68 , a portion of which is defined by one or more mesh or mesh-like filter elements 78 . Such filter elements 78 are supported by the brew basket 12 in slightly spaced relation to the adjacent divider wall 36 to define a flow pathway for brewed coffee to pass therebetween to a drip outlet port 79 (FIG. 6) formed in the upper bowl 29 and an underlying drip outlet port 80 (FIGS. 5-6) formed in the lower shell 39 . This latter outlet port 80 is positioned over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 , whereby the brewed coffee flows downwardly for collection within the pot 20 . As viewed in FIGS. 1-6, the brew basket cavity 32 formed in the upper housing bowl 29 may intersect and thereby interrupt a forward region of the bowl 29 , to form an arcuate recess 83 to expose a frontal portion or segment 82 of the brew basket 12 at a front side of the brewer head 28 . In this regard, this exposed frontal segment 82 of the brew basket 12 is desirably formed from a transparent or partially transparent material to permit visual observation of the swirling and spinning fluidized bed during the brewing procedure. A lower margin of the recess 83 in the upper bowl 29 is disposed above the drip outlet port 79 . The removable cap 77 may also be formed from a transparent or partially transparent material. In use, to brew a pot of coffee, a selected volume of water is poured into the water reservoir 30 , and the brew basket 12 containing a selected quantity of ground coffee is placed into the associated brew basket cavity 32 in the brewer head 28 . A portion of the water within the reservoir 30 will flow downwardly through the first check valve 45 to fill the associated pathway within the heating unit 34 . Then, upon depression of the on-off button 22 , the heating unit 34 is energized to raise the temperature of the water therein substantially to boiling, resulting in pressure-forced pumping the hot water upwardly through the inverted and elevated inverted conduit turn 56 and further through the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 within the brew basket 12 . This upwardly pumped water is replaced by continued water downflow from the reservoir 30 , for heating by the heating unit 34 , until the reservoir 30 reaches a substantially empty condition. The hot water is jetted into the interior of the brew basket 12 via the jet ports 14 , as described, to generate the swirling turbulent fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. The thus-brewed coffee is filtered through the mesh filter elements 78 for delivery into the underlying pot 20 , wherein the brewed coffee may be retained in a heated state by suitably controlling the heating unit 34 for heating the platen 18 . Alternately, the heating unit 34 may be designed to de-activate and the brewed coffee may be retained within an insulated decanter. Following this brew cycle, the brew basket 12 may be removed from the brewer head 28 for appropriate cleaning and discarding of the spent coffee grounds retained on the filter elements. Thereafter, the brew basket 12 may be refilled with coffee grounds for a subsequent brew cycle. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention thus produces brewed coffee by means of intimately thorough and consistent intermixing between the hot water and coffee grounds, to produce a coffee beverage of repeatable high quality taste and other characteristics. In addition, because the heated water passes directly into the coffee grounds, the resultant steam rising from the fluidized bed is believed to carry enhanced or intensified coffee aroma, thereby producing an enhanced of more enjoyable coffee brewing experience. FIGS. 12-20 depict a modified coffee brewer 110 constructed in accordance with one alternative preferred form of the invention. For sake of clarity and ease of description, components common to those shown and described in FIGS. 1-11 are identified by common reference numerals, whereas modified components which correspond generally in terms of function with those shown and described in FIGS. 1-11 are identified by common reference numerals increased by 100 . In general terms, the modified coffee brewer 110 of FIGS. 12-19 includes an externally visible light 84 positioned generally within a transparent frontal segment 182 or front window for illuminating the visible brewing process. More particularly, the modified coffee brewer 110 generally comprises a lower support base 16 defining a platen 18 for removably supporting a coffee pot 20 . The pot 20 is positioned beneath an upper brewer head 28 mounted on an upstanding support post 26 . An on-off button or switch 22 is provided on the front of the support base 16 for initiating a brew cycle. The upper brewer head 28 comprises an upwardly open housing bowl 29 carrying a hinged lid 138 for normally closing and covering the otherwise open top of the bowl 29 , as viewed in FIG. 12. The hinged lid 138 can be pivoted upwardly to an open position, as viewed in FIGS. 14-15, to expose the bowl interior which includes a central divider wall 36 separating the bowl interior into a rearwardly disposed water reservoir 30 and a forwardly disposed brew basket cavity 32 . A hinged cap 177 is shown for normally closing and covering the brew basket cavity 32 . A modified brew basket 112 is removably seated within this cavity 32 , for supporting a selected quantity of ground coffee in the course of a coffee brewing cycle. Importantly, in this modified embodiment, water from the reservoir 30 is coupled through an appropriate heating element for delivery via an inflow port 62 (FIG. 15) to the brew basket 112 , in the same manner as shown and described previously herein with respect to FIGS. 1-11. As shown in FIGS. 12-15, the light 84 is positioned generally at the front of the brew basket cavity 32 , generally centered at a lower margin of the front-open arcuate recess 83 . The light 84 comprises a relatively small light element preferably such as an LED upstanding a short distance at this lower margin of the recess 83 . In one preferred form, the light 84 incorporates a translucent bulb body such as a frosted bulb for providing broad and relatively uniform dispersal of generated light energy, substantially without providing a sharp point of light. Alternately, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a non-frosted bulb may also be used. Persons skilled in the art will also recognize that a variety of different light sources may be used, including but not limited to incandescent bulbs and the like. The brew basket 112 (FIGS.15-19) is generally constructed as previously shown and described to include an underside feed port (not shown) for registry with the inflow port 62 when the brew basket 112 is seated within the cavity 32 for a brew cycle. Hot water from the inflow port 62 thus enters a false bottom or plenum chamber (also not shown) of the brew basket 112 , for flow further to and upwardly through a plurality of upstanding hollow ribs 72 each having at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed therein. As previously described, these jet ports 14 deliver the hot water in jetted streams into the brew basket interior for turbulently agitating and stirring the coffee grounds during a brew cycle. At least one and preferably a plurality of these jet ports 14 are disposed below the surface level of the coffee grounds contained within the brew basket, as previously shown and described. The frontal segment 182 of the brew basket 112 comprises a forwardly protruding structure having a size and shape for substantially seated reception within the arcuate recess 83 . Accordingly, this frontal segment 182 defines a generally U-shaped shoulder 88 which protrudes forwardly from the otherwise generally truncated conical profile of the brew basket 112 . A forward margin of this shoulder 88 is joined to a substantially transparent front window 89 of the frontal segment 182 , whereas a rearward margin of the shoulder 88 is joined to the rearwardly-disposed truncated conical portion of the brew basket which includes mesh-type filter elements or segments 78 through which brewed coffee may flow outwardly and drain downwardly into the underlying coffee pot 20 as previously shown and described in FIGS. 1-11. The U-shaped shoulder 88 of the forwardly protruding frontal segment 182 defines a relatively small, downwardly open pocket 90 . This pocket 90 is positioned, and has a size and shape, for sliding reception of the upstanding light 84 , when the brew basket 112 is mounted within the brew cavity 32 . As viewed in FIG. 20 in accordance with a preferred construction, this pocket 90 is spaced rearwardly at least a short distance from an inboard side of the transparent window 89 , thereby defining a chamber 91 therebetween, so that a portion of the water-borne coffee grounds may flow or circulate through this chamber 91 , i.e., between the window 89 and the light-containing pocket 90 . In this position, when energized, the light 84 illuminates or back-lights the transparent window 89 thereby also illuminating and back-lighting the portion of the water-borne coffee grounds circulating between the light and the window to render the brewing process externally visible. When a non-frosted light 84 is used, the region of the basket defining the pocket 90 is preferably frosted for improved and relatively even light distribution. As previously noted, this brew process includes multiple water jets oriented for turbulently stirring the coffee grounds during the brew cycle, for purposes of achieving improved extraction of coffee flavor. When the brew cycle is initiated as by depression of the on-off button 22 , a control circuit 23 (FIG. 12) energizes the light 84 . Upon completion of the brew cycle, as indicated by a cessation of jetted water inflow to the brew basket 112 , the control circuit 23 may be adapted to turn the light 84 off thereby indicating brew cycle completion. FIG. 21 shows a further alternative preferred form of the invention, wherein components identical to those shown and described in FIGS. 12-20 are referred by common reference numerals, and further wherein modified but otherwise functionally similar components are referred to by reference numerals increased by 100 . As shown, a light 84 is carried on the lower end of a post 92 depending from a modified hinged cap 277 for closing the brew basket cavity 32 during a brew cycle. The light 84 in FIG. 21 is suitable coupled to the control circuit 23 for on-off regulation in the same manner as previously shown and described with respect to FIGS. 12-20. In particular, during a brew cycle, the light 84 in FIG. 21 is spaced rearwardly from an inboard side of the transparent front window 89 on the brew basket 112 , thereby permitting at least some of the water-borne coffee grounds to circulate between the light 84 and the window 89 during brewing. Such circulating grounds are thus back-lighted for easy external viewing. The light 84 may be frosted, or otherwise positioned within a frosted pocket defined at a distal end of the post 92 . FIG. 22 is a schematic diagram showing the coffee brewer of FIGS. 12-21 in association with the control circuit 23 . As shown, water from the reservoir 30 flows through the pair of check valves 45 and 60 disposed at opposite sides of the heating unit 34 for supply as hot water jets into the interior of the brew basket 110 as previously shown and described. Such water flow is initiated upon depression of a suitable on-off switch or button 22 adapted to couple electrical power to the heating unit 34 , and also through a light control circuit 94 to the light 84 . Illumination of the light 84 can be responsive to a suitable sensor 96 such as temperature sensor for detecting the presence of hot water flow from the second check valve 60 and through the conduit 58 to the brew basket. Suitable sensor forms may include a thermistor, or a bimetal thermal sensor, or the like. When heater water flow is initiated and detected by the sensor 96 , the light 84 is illuminated by the light control circuit 94 . When the brew cycle is complete, and hot water flow past the sensor 96 thus stops, the sensor will detect a reduced temperature and thereupon signal the light control circuit 94 to extinguish the light 84 thus providing a visible indication that the brew process has been finished. In a further alternative form as viewed in FIG.23, a modified sensor 196 may be provided in the form of a float element 97 carrying a magnet 98 or the like in close proximity with a magnetic reed switch 296 coupled to the light control circuit 94 . In this embodiment, upon initiation of hot water flow to the brew basket 110 , the float element 97 is carried upwardly along the flow conduit 58 thereby displacing the magnet 98 relative to the reed switch 296 resulting in switch movement indicative of said hot water flow. The reed switch 296 thus signals the light control circuit 94 which responds by energizing the light 84 . Subsequently, when the hot water flow ceases, the float element descends within the conduit for reversing the state of the reed switch 296 , which thereupon signals the light control circuit 94 to de-energize the light 84 . Suitable stops 101 and 103 may be provided along the conduit for defining end limits of float movement therein. A variety of further modifications and improvements in and to the coffee brewer of the present invention will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art. Accordingly, no limitation on the invention is intended by way of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings, except as set forth in the appended claims.","20060102010"

No. 15/482,121, which was filed on 7 Apr. 2017, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/320,101, filed on 8 Apr. 2016. The entire disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Technical Field Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods for brewing coffee. Discussion of Art Coffee can be consumed as a hot or cold beverage. In order to produce cold coffee (e.g., coffee that is cooled below room temperature, such as to a temperature that is no greater than 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a variety of known techniques may be used. A cold brewing technique involves grinding coffee beans and placing the ground coffee beans into cold or room temperature water for a prolonged period of time. Typically, the coffee grounds are placed into the water for twelve hours or more. The coffee grounds are filtered out of the water and coffee that is either cool or at room temperature is produced. Because of the prolonged time needed for brewing the coffee using this technique, however, cold brewing may not be suitable for many applications. Additionally, because coffee beans include components such as caffeine, oils, and fatty acids that are more soluble at elevated temperatures but less soluble or insoluble at the temperatures at which the coffee is brewed using the cold brewing technique, the flavor profile of coffee produced using the cold brewing technique may not be desirable to many consumers. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then add ice to the hot coffee to cool the coffee to a lower temperature. This technique results in the coffee becoming diluted, which may not be desired by many consumers. Additionally, control over the flavor profile of the coffee can be difficult due to the inability to accurately control the amount of dilution of the coffee on a repeated basis. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then cool the coffee, such as by placing the coffee in a refrigerated container. One problem with this technique is that the time required to cool the coffee can be considerable. The longer the time period needed to cool the coffee, the more the coffee may oxidize. The oxidized coffee can provide a taste that is undesirable to many consumers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The subject matter described herein will be better understood from reading the following description of non-limiting embodiments, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein below: FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system for producing cold coffee; and FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for brewing cold coffee. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system 100 for producing cold coffee. The brewing system 100 is used to generate cold coffee within a relatively short time period without diluting the coffee or allowing the coffee to oxidize. As a result, the end product is cooled coffee produced in a short period of time and having a flavor profile that is the same as or closer to hot coffee than cold coffee brewed by other techniques. In one embodiment, the brewing system 100 can generate a large amount of cold coffee within a short time period, such as at least 35 gallons of cold coffee, at least 75 gallons of cold coffee, up to 150 gallons of cold coffee, up to 1,500 gallons of cold coffee, or another amount, within twenty minutes (or another period of time). Optionally (and as described below), the brewing system 100 may add a gas to the cold coffee, such as nitrogen, after brewing. The brewing system 100 includes a brewing tank 102 , such as a lauter tun or other container, that holds a filter body 104 . The brewing tank 102 forms an enclosure in which heated water is mixed with coffee grounds to brew hot coffee. In one embodiment, water is preheated in another tank and transferred to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, the water may be heated in the brewing tank 102 . For example, the brewing tank 102 may include one or more heating elements, or bodies that become heated and thereby heat the water in the tank 102 . The water may be heated to an elevated temperature suitable for brewing coffee. In one embodiment, the water is heated to a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit (or 93.3 degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the water may be heated to a temperature of 198 to 202 degrees Fahrenheit (or 92.2 to 94.4 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 198 and 202 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (or 90.6 to 96.1 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 190 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (or 87.8 to 98.9 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 190 and 210 degrees Fahrenheit. Optionally, another elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature) may be used. Some, but not all, of the heated water used for brewing coffee using the system 100 during the brewing of a single batch of coffee may be mixed with coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 . The amount of heated water that is equivalent to one third of the total amount of water used to brew coffee in a single batch may be added to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water may be added to the brewing tank 102 . For example, if seventy-five gallons of water are to be used in brewing coffee during a single batch, then twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water can be in the tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water can be added to the tank 102 , such as fifty gallons (or 190 liters) of water (e.g., when 150 gallons or 570 liters of water are used to brew coffee), 500 gallons (or 1900 liters) of water (e.g., when 1500 gallons or 5700 liters of water are used to brew coffee), or another amount can be added to the tank 102 . The coffee grounds may be relatively large size. For example, coffee beans may be ground such that, when the coffee grounds are passed through a ROTAP device, 69-75% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #20 and #30 sieves, 25-28% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #12 and #16 sieves, and 10-14% of the coffee grounds pass through a US Standard Size #30 sieve and into a pan or other collection device. Alternatively, the coffee grounds may be a smaller size. Coffee grounds are introduced into the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to begin brewing hot coffee. In one embodiment, sixty pounds (or twenty-seven kilograms) of ground coffee beans are mixed into twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water in the tank 102 . Alternatively, a greater or lesser amount of coffee grounds may be mixed with a greater or lesser amount of heated water. The amount of coffee grounds may be based on the amount of coffee to be brewed. For example, the amount of coffee grounds may increase with larger batches of coffee being brewed, and can decrease with smaller batches of coffee being brewed. The ratio of weight of heated water to coffee grounds used to brew the coffee may be a 10:1 ratio (e.g., seventy-five gallons of heated water and sixty pounds of ground coffee) in one embodiment. Alternatively, another ratio of heated water to may be used. For example, a ratio of at least 12:1 to no more than 8:1 may be used, a ratio of at least 11:1 to no more than 9:1 may be used, or another ratio may be used. The coffee grounds are agitated in the heated water in the tank 102 in one embodiment. This agitation may be performed manually, such as by an operator of the system 100 moving a paddle or other object in the tank 102 to agitate the coffee grounds. Alternatively, the agitation may be performed automatically or by machine implementation, such as by one or more motors moving one or more paddles within the tank 102 . Additional heated water is added to the tank 102 in one embodiment. The remaining amount of water used to brew the batch of coffee may be added. For example, if the amount of heated water that equals one third of the total amount of water to be used in brewing coffee is already in the tank 102 , then an amount of heated water that equals two thirds of the total amount of water to be used in brewing the coffee can be added to the tank 102 . Agitation of the coffee grounds in the water in the tank 102 can occur while the remaining heated water is introduced into the tank 102 . The coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a brewing time. This brewing time can vary to achieve different flavors of coffee, can vary based on the amount of coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 , and/or can vary based on the amount of heated water in the brewing tank 102 . In one embodiment, the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a time period of at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty minutes. Alternatively, a shorter or longer time period may be used. This time period may be referred to as a contact time. Once the brewing time is complete, a drain valve 106 opens. The drain valve 106 controls flow of the coffee brewed in the tank 102 (referred to as hot coffee or hot brewed coffee) through one or more conduits 108 in the system 100 . A first portion of the conduits 108 fluidly couples the brewing tank 102 with a filter 110 . Responsive to opening the drain valve 106 , the hot brewed coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 and flows through the first portion of the conduits 108 to the filter 110 . The filter 110 may be referred to as an in-line filter. The hot brewed coffee can flow through the filter body 104 , where at least some of the coffee grounds introduced into the brewing tank 102 are filtered or otherwise removed from the hot brewed coffee. The filter body 104 may be a metal filter or another type of filter. The coffee passing through the filter body 104 may include some additional coffee grounds, which are removed from the hot brewed coffee by the filter 110 . The hot brewed coffee flows through the filter 110 to remove remaining coffee grounds. The filter 110 may be a centrifugal filter or another type of filter. In one embodiment, the filter 110 is a twenty inch (or fifty-one centimeter) inline filter with a metal wedge wire micron 127 filter. Alternatively, another type of filter may be used. A pump 112 generates a suction force in the conduits 108 to draw the hot brewed coffee through the conduits 108 . The pump 112 can pull on the hot brewed coffee flowing out of the brewing tank 102 and through the filter 110 . The coffee exiting the filter 110 can be referred to as filtered coffee. The pump 112 can direct the filtered coffee (which may remain at an elevated temperature, such as the temperature at which the coffee was brewed or slightly less, such as five to ten degrees Fahrenheit less) through a second portion of the conduits 108 to a heat exchanger 114 . With the storage tank 102 and the pump 112 , a unique coffee brewing process is provided by the system 100 . This brewing process includes a first stage, immersion type of coffee brewing, where the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 (e.g., with the drain valve 106 remaining closed) for a first designated period of time. This first designated period of time may be approximately six minutes in one embodiment. Alternatively, a different period of time may be used, such as between five and seven minutes. The brewing process includes a subsequent, second stage of pressure assisted drip type of coffee brewing. This stage involves the coffee dripping out of a bed of coffee grounds formed on the filter body 104 in the storage tank 102 into the first portion of the conduits 108 . The coffee may be drawn through this bed of coffee grounds by the pressure or suction generated by the pump 112 . This second stage of the brewing process can last for a different, second designated period of time. This second designated period of time may be approximately nine to fourteen minutes. For example, the second designated period of time may be at least nine minutes and no more than fourteen minutes. Alternatively, the second designated period of time may be different, such as at least eight minutes and no more than fifteen minutes, at least seven minutes and no more than sixteen minutes, or another period of time. The heat exchanger 114 cools the filtered coffee to a designated reduced temperature. The heat exchanger 114 can be a plate-style heat exchanger that pumps water, glycol, or other fluids in channels that are separate from, but thermally coupled with, channels in the heat exchanger 114 through which the filtered coffee flows due to the pressure generated by the pump 112 . This allows the heat exchanger 114 to cool the hot and filtered coffee without diluting the coffee or changing the chemical constituents of the coffee. The heat exchanger 114 rapidly cools the filtered coffee in one embodiment. For example, the temperature of the filtered coffee may decrease by at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (or seventy-one degrees Celsius), by at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit (or sixty-six degrees Celsius), by at least 125 degrees Fahrenheit (or fifty-two degrees Celsius), by at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or thirty-eight degrees Celsius), or by another amount. In one embodiment, the filtered coffee is cooled during flow of the filtered coffee through the heat exchanger 114 to a temperature of forty degrees Fahrenheit (or four degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the filtered coffee may be cooled to another temperature, such as between thirty-eight and forty-two degrees Fahrenheit or three to six degrees Celsius, inclusive; between thirty-six and forty-four degrees Fahrenheit or two to seven degrees Celsius, inclusive; or another temperature. The filtered coffee is cooled rapidly and faster than the coffee would be cooled by storing the filtered coffee in a standard home refrigerator overnight or by pouring the coffee over ice. For example, filtered coffee may be cooled to the designated temperature in less than twenty minutes, less than fifteen minutes, less than ten minutes, or less than five minutes, depending on the heat exchanger 114 (e.g., the size of the heat exchanger 114 ). Keeping the total time for producing the cooled coffee relatively short can reduce the total contact time of the water and coffee with the coffee grounds. Allowing the water and coffee to remain in contact with the coffee grounds for longer time periods can significantly deteriorate the taste of the end result coffee, such as by producing a more bitter coffee than is achieved by shorter contact times between the coffee grounds and the water or coffee. Additionally, once the filtered coffee leaves the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may provide a sealed environment that does not expose the coffee to the ambient environment and/or oxygen until after the coffee is removed from the system 100 . This also can assist in producing a coffee having an improved flavor profile relative to coffee that is exposed to the ambient environment and/or oxygen during cooling or storage. The filtered coffee may be cooled without freezing or partially freezing the coffee, so that the cooled coffee exiting the heat exchanger 114 can continue to flow through a third portion of the conduits 108 to a storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the storage tank 116 can be referred to as a brite tank or bright tank. The cooled coffee is directed into the storage tank 116 by the pressure generated by the pump 112 . The time period between placing the coffee grounds into contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to placing or directing the cooled and filtered coffee into the storage tank 116 may be relatively short, such as twenty minutes or less, thirty minutes or less, or another amount of time. This short time period for brewing, filtering, and rapidly cooling the hot coffee may be used for large volumes of coffee, such as seventy-five gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, etc. The cold coffee may be brewed hot, filtered, and then cooled while not diluting the coffee or having the coffee stored in an environment that causes oxidation of the coffee for an extended period of time (e.g., more than twelve hours). Subsequent to the immersion brewing process in the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may reduce or prevent contact between the coffee and one or more constituents in the ambient environment (e.g., oxygen) by sealing the components of the system 100 from the external environment, as described above. This can assist in preventing the coffee from oxidizing or otherwise being chemically altered during the process described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the storage tank 116 is fluidly coupled with a gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can represent a tank of pressurized gas or a machine that generates the gas at an elevated pressure. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can store a gas that is introduced into the storage tank 116 to be mixed with the cooled coffee. For example, the gas source 118 may include nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas is held in the gas source 118 at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch (or at least 3.1 bar). A valve 120 is closed to prevent the gas in the gas source 118 from flowing into the storage tank 116 and is opened to allow the gas in the gas source 118 to flow into the storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the valve 120 is open prior to the coffee being introduced into the storage tank 116 in order to introduce the gas in the tank 116 . The storage tank 116 may be purged with the gas prior to transferring coffee into the tank 116 to achieve no less than 100 parts per billion of dissolved oxygen in the tank 116 at a pressure (or absence of pressure) of zero pounds per square inch. The gas can be introduced into the tank 116 at a pressure of at least fourteen pounds per square inch, at least 14.5 pounds per square inch, at least fifteen pounds per square inch, or another pressure. This introduction of the gas prior to entry of the coffee into the tank 116 can charge (or at least partially fill) the tank 116 with the gas and purge oxygen from the tank 116 . The gas and cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 together in order to mix the gas with the cooled coffee. For example, nitrogen may be mixed in with the cooled coffee. Once the coffee is in the tank 116 , the pressure of the gas is supplied into the storage tank 116 can be increased to an elevated pressure, such as at least forty-five pounds per square inch, in one embodiment. Alternatively, the gas can be supplied into the storage tank 116 at another pressure, such as at least fifty-five pounds per square inch, at least thirty pounds per square inch, and/or up to sixth pounds per square inch, or another pressure. The gas may be supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least a designated period of time. Exposure of the coffee to the gas for such as extended period of time can assist in the coffee absorbing at least some of the gas while in the tank 116 . In one embodiment, the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least twenty-four hours. Another time period alternatively may be used. In one embodiment, a carbonating or carbonation stone is placed inside the storage tank 116 while the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 . The carbonating or carbonation stone may be added to the storage tank 116 to decrease the time that the cooled coffee is held in the storage tank 116 before serving at least some of the cooled coffee to one or more consumers. For example, without the carbonating or carbonation stone, the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for twenty-four hours while the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for four hours. In the illustrated embodiment, the system 100 includes a controller 122 that operates to control various components of the system 100 . The controller 122 represents hardware circuitry that includes and/or is electrically connected with one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits, or other electronic logic-based devices). The controller 122 is communicatively coupled with various components of the system 100 to allow the controller 122 to generate and communicate control signals that direct the components to implement various actions. For example, the controller 122 can be coupled with the drain valve 106 , the pump 112 , the heat exchanger 114 , and/or the valve 120 by one or more wired and/or wireless connections over or through which the controller 122 can transmit and/or broadcast control signals to control operations of these components. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the controller 122 , or may include several controllers 122 that separately control operations of different components of the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the drain valve 106 to change a state of the drain valve 106 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the drain valve 106 (or a motor or other device coupled with the drain valve 106 ) to open the drain valve 106 or to close the drain valve 106 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the drain valve 106 is open or closed. The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the pump 112 to activate or deactivate the pump 112 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the pump 112 (or a motor or other device of the pump 112 ) to turn on the pump 112 and cause the pump 112 to begin generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 or to turn the pump 112 off and stop the pump 112 from generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the heat exchanger 114 to activate or deactivate the heat exchanger 114 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the heat exchanger (or a motor or other device of the heat exchanger 114 ) to turn on the heat exchanger 114 and cause the heat exchanger 114 to begin cooling the coffee or to turn the heat exchanger 114 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the valve 120 to change a state of the valve 120 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the valve 120 (or a motor or other device coupled with the valve 120 ) to open the valve 120 or to close the valve 120 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the valve 120 is open or closed to control the flow of gas in the gas source 118 into the storage tank 116 . FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 200 for brewing cold coffee. The method 200 can be performed by the system 100 described herein to brew cold coffee in large amounts within a short time period without diluting the coffee or changing flavor of the hot coffee that is initially brewed (e.g., through oxidation). Optionally, the method 200 can represent an algorithm that is a software program or that is used to program one or more of the components of the system 100 to brew the cold coffee. At 202 , water is heated to an elevated temperature. As one example, the water can be heated to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit, as described above. The water can be heated in the brewing tank 102 or in another location. At 204 , a portion (and less than all) of the heated water is placed into the brewing tank. For example, one third of the total water used to brew a single batch of coffee (e.g., the 75 gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, or other amount) may be adding to the brewing tank 102 . At 206 , coffee grounds are added to the heated water in the brewing tank 102 . At 208 , the remainder of the heated water is added to the brewing tank 102 . During and/or after addition of the coffee grounds and water to the brewing tank 102 , the mixture of the coffee grounds and the water may be agitated, as described above. At 210 , hot coffee is brewed in the brewing tank 102 using immersion brewing. During this brewing, the water and coffee grounds remain in the brewing tank 102 so that the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water. At 212 , a determination is made as to whether the immersion brewing of the coffee in the brewing tank 102 is complete. If the immersion brewing is complete (e.g., the coffee grounds have been in contact with the heated water for a designated time period, as described above), then flow of the method 200 can proceed toward 214 . Otherwise, flow of the method 200 can return toward 210 so that immersion brewing can continue until complete. At 214 , a drain valve is opened in order to drain the hot coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The coffee drained from the brewing tank 102 is heated. For example, the coffee may be at an elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature, above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, above 150 degrees Fahrenheit to 205 degrees Fahrenheit, or another range of acceptable brewing temperatures) as the coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 . At 216 , a pump is activated to force the heated coffee through one or more conduits. The pump may be activated to being pressure assisted drip brewing of the coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The pump may be activated at the same time that the drain valve is opened, after the drain valve is opened, or prior to opening the drain valve in different embodiments. At 218 , the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 is filtered using multiple stage filters. For example, the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 may be drained from the brewing tank 102 through the filter body 104 in the brewing tank 102 and then filtered again using the inline filter 110 . Alternatively, the hot coffee may be filtered using more than two filters or using a single filter. At 220 , the coffee is rapidly cooled. The coffee can be cooled after the coffee has been filtered, as described above. Alternatively, the coffee can be cooled prior to filtering the coffee or between filters of a multi-stage filtering process. The coffee may be cooled within a relatively short time period without diluting or chemically altering the coffee, in contrast to cooling techniques involving mixing the coffee with ice, allowing the coffee to slowly cool (thereby resulting in oxidation), etc. The coffee can be cooled by flowing the coffee through one or more heat exchangers. At 222 , the cooled and filtered coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The coffee can be stored in the storage tank 116 for at least a designated time period (e.g., twenty-four hours), or may be immediately available for consumption following completion of the brewing of the batch of coffee (where the batch is completed when the water mixed with the coffee in the brewing tank 102 has reached the storage tank 116 ). The storage tank 116 may be sealed to reduce or eliminate contact between the coffee and the external environment to reduce or eliminate oxidation or other chemical changes to the coffee. As described above, the tank 116 may be purged with the gas (e.g., nitrogen) to remove oxygen from the tank 116 , the coffee may then be introduced into the tank 116 , and the pressure of the gas can be increased to the head pressure to cause the gas to be absorbed in the coffee in the tank 116 . At 224 , the coffee optionally may be mixed with a gas. For example, nitrogen can be directed into the storage tank 116 to mix with the coffee while the coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The mixture of coffee and the gas can provide a pleasant or desired taste to at least some consumers. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes adding a first portion of a total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to a brewing tank, subsequently adding the coffee grounds to the brewing tank, and adding a remaining portion of the total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee, filtering the hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee produces a batch amount of cooled coffee, where the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least seventy-five gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 150 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 1,500 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a ratio of ten to one of the hot water to the coffee grounds by weight. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes a multiple stage brewing process that includes an immersion brewing stage of the hot coffee and a pressure assisted drip brewing stage of the hot coffee. In one example, the pressure assisted drip brewing stage occurs over a longer time period than the immersion brewing stage. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water in a brewing tank, and wherein filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes additionally passing the hot coffee through an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes agitating a mixture of the coffee grounds and the hot water. In one example, the method also includes mixing the cooled coffee with nitrogen gas. In one example, the nitrogen gas is mixed with the cooled coffee at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas for at least twenty-four hours. In one example, mixing the cooled coffee with the nitrogen gas occurs in presence of a carbonating stone. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas in the presence of the carbonating stone for no more than six hours. In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, the brewing tank is a Lauter tun. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least seventy-five gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 150 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 1,500 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the one or more filters include multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, the one or more filters include a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, the one or more filters also include an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, the system also includes a storage tank in which the cooled coffee is mixed with nitrogen gas. In one example, the storage tank includes a carbonating stone. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to improvements in devices and systems for brewing coffee or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved coffee brewer utilizing streams of heated water for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds, to yield brewed coffee having improved flavor and enhanced aroma and other characteristics. Drip-style coffee brewers are available in a wide range of different configurations and sizes for use in residential or commercial environments to produce brewed coffee. Such coffee brewers commonly include a water reservoir from which a controlled volume of water is heated and then dispensed downwardly by dripping or spraying onto coffee grounds contained within an underlying, upwardly open brew basket. The hot water intermixes with the coffee grounds to produce the desired brewed coffee beverage which is drained from the brew basket through a filter element into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In one common form, the brewer includes a refillable water reservoir from which the water is delivered through a heating element for drip-flow dispensing into the brew basket. Alternately, the brewer may be coupled directly to a tap water supply or the like. While drip-style coffee brewers of the above described type have been used extensively for many years, the flavor and other characteristics of the brewed coffee is inconsistent and, in many cases, can be of marginal or unacceptable quality. Such problems are believed to stem from inadequate and/or inconsistent intermixing of the hot water with the coffee grounds contained in the brew basket, resulting in brewed coffee exhibiting inconsistent flavor and body traits, often including unacceptable bitter taste attributes. In this regard, the downward dispensing of hot water onto the initially dry coffee grounds in the underlying brew basket can produce erosion-type channels through the coffee grounds, wherein such channels can permit a significant portion of the water volume to pass through the coffee grounds and drip from the brew basket without significantly wetting or otherwise adequately intermixing therewith. While this channeling problem can sometimes be mitigated by carefully pre-distributing the coffee grounds substantially uniformly within the brew basket, significant attention to this aspect of the coffee brewing process is seldom given. A variety of modified coffee brewers and related brewing processes have been provided in an attempt to overcome these problems and disadvantages by providing improved intermixing between the heated water and the coffee grounds within a filtered brew basket. In general, such concepts utilize mechanical stirring devices for improving thorough contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds. While such concepts may provide brewed coffee with enhanced and/or more consistent flavor characteristics, they inherently incorporate moving parts that increase the overall complexity and cost of the coffee brewer, and are susceptible to occasional break-down to require periodic repair or replacement. There exists, therefore, a continuing need for further improvements in and to coffee brewers and related coffee brewing processes for achieving significantly improved intermixing between heated water and coffee grounds, for providing brewed coffee of consistent high quality and improved flavor and other desirable attributes, without requiring mechanical stirring devices and their attendant disadvantages. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, an improved coffee brewer and brewing method are provided for producing brewed coffee with improved flavor. The coffee brewer includes a removably mounted brew basket having jet ports connected to a source of heated water and positioned to deliver hot water streams into the brew basket at a location for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds contained therein to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds for improved flavor extraction. This fluidized bed is directed against one or more mesh filter elements forming a wall portion of the brew basket for outward passage of the thus-produced coffee which is then directed into an underlying carafe or the like. In one preferred form, the coffee brewer includes a water reservoir coupled via a first check valve for flow in heat transfer relation with a heating unit. The heating unit elevates the temperature of the water substantially to the boiling point, whereupon the heated water flows through a second check valve to the brew basket. The heated water flows to and through the jet ports into the interior of the brew basket, with at least some of the jet ports being disposed at a position beneath the level of coffee grounds contained therein. As a result, the heated water is jetted or sprayed into and thoroughly wets the coffee grounds with an agitating and stirring action that is effective to lift, suspend, and turbulently stir the grounds in a manner to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne grounds. In the preferred form, the jet ports are oriented for rotationally stirring the coffee grounds with a substantial spinning or orbital path of motion. The fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds provides improved and consistent intermixing of the heated water with the coffee grounds for enhanced flavor extraction with minimal bitter and/or other undesirable attributes. This spinning fluidized bed is directed by centrifugal action in a generally radially outward direction against an inboard side wall of the brew basket, a portion of which is defined by the mesh filter element or elements which permit outward flow-through passage of the brewed liquid coffee while substantially preventing outward passage of the coffee grounds. The brewed coffee passed through the filter element or elements is directed further as by gravity flow into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention, a frontal portion of the brew basket side wall comprises a substantially transparent window visible from the exterior of the coffee brewer, when the brew basket mounted is thereon. During a brewing cycle, the spinning fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket is thus externally observable. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As shown in the exemplary drawings, an improved coffee brewer referred to generally in FIGS. 1-6 by the reference numeral 10 is provided for rapid and consistent high quality brewing of coffee. The coffee brewer 10 includes a brew basket 12 (FIGS. 4-10) for receiving a selected quantity of ground coffee (not shown). In accordance with a primary aspect of the invention, the brew basket 12 is adapted for connection to a source of heated water, and includes at least one and preferably a plurality of jet ports 14 (FIGS. 7 and 9 - 11 ) positioned for agitating and turbulently stirring the coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of suspended and water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket 12 . This fluidized bed results in substantially improved and intimately thorough wetting contact and intermixing between the hot water and the coffee grounds, for achieving enhanced flavor extraction to consistently produce a high quality, fuller-bodied and more robust coffee beverage. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention is shown generally in one preferred form in FIGS. 1-6. As depicted, the coffee brewer 10 comprises a relatively compact base 16 having a platen 18 formed or carried thereon with a size and shape suitable for secure rested support of a coffee pot 20 such as a carafe or decanter or the like. An on-off button 22 is exposed at a front side of the base 16 and may be depressed manually when brewing of a pot of coffee is desired, as will be described in more detail. A power cord 24 (FIG. 1) protrudes rearwardly from the base 16 for connecting the brewer 10 to a suitable electrical power source. A support post 26 extends upwardly from a rear side of the base 16 to support an upper brewer head 28 in a positioned generally cantilevered over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 supported on the base platen 18 . In general terms, the brewer head 28 comprises a relatively compact housing structure defining a water reservoir 30 (FIGS. 3-4) for receiving a selected volume of water for use in brewing a pot of coffee, in combination with an upwardly open cavity 32 (FIGS. 4-6) for removably supporting the brew basket 12 . Upon depression of the on-off button 22 , water within the reservoir 30 is delivered in heat exchange relation with a heating unit 34 shown mounted within the base 16 as viewed in FIG. 6, and further to the brewer basket jet ports 14 for delivery into the interior of the brew basket 12 in the form of a plurality of pressurized or jetted hot water streams. These hot water jets turbulently stir and intermix with coffee grounds contained within the brew basket 12 to produce the fluidized bed or suspension of coffee grounds within a spinning and swirling body of water within the brew basket, to produce the improved, high quality, and consistent coffee beverage in accordance with the invention. This coffee beverage is filtered and delivered from the brew basket to the underlying coffee pot or carafe 20 , ready for immediate use and enjoyment. More particularly, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 3-6, the illustrative brewer head 28 includes an upper housing bowl 29 with an internal, generally vertically oriented divider wall 36 subdividing the brewer head 28 into the upwardly open water reservoir 30 occupying a rearward region of the head 28 , and the brewer basket cavity 32 at a forward region of the head 28 . A rear hinged lid 38 is provided on the brewer head 28 for normally closing the water reservoir 30 , but this lid 38 is adapted for quick and easy pivoting movement to an open position (as viewed in FIGS. 3-4) to permit a selected volume of water to be poured into the reservoir 30 . In a typical residential coffee maker, the reservoir 30 may be sized for receiving a standardized volume of water, such as a water volume sufficient to brew a standardized volume of coffee, such as 8, 10 or 12 cups. Alternately, the brewer head 28 may include volumetric gradation marks (not shown) indicating the volume of water contained therein, to facilitate brewing of different selected volumes of coffee. As a further alternative, persons skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the coffee brewer 10 may be connected directly to a tap water source or the like, in lieu of the reservoir 30 for pour-in reception of a selected water volume. The upper housing bowl 29 defining the water reservoir 30 is mounted on a lower housing shell 39 (shown best in FIGS. 5-6) which is supported at an upper end of the support post 26 in cantilevered relation spaced above the base 16 . Water within the reservoir 30 is coupled through a port 40 formed in a bottom wall of the upper bowl 29 (FIG. 6) to an underlying receiver 44 which is mounted on the lower shell 39 within a compartment 46 defined cooperatively between the upper bowl 29 and lower shell 39 . This receiver 44 may include a spring-loaded valve positioned for engagement by the upper bowl 29 for movement to an open position permitting downward water flow from the reservoir 30 , when the upper bowl 29 is mounted on the lower shell 39 . Such downward water flow proceeds through the receiver 44 and further through a short supply conduit 48 (FIGS. 5-6) which couples the water downflow to a passage 50 formed in the support post 26 and further to the heating unit 34 . A first check valve 45 (FIG. 6) is mounted along this passage 50 within the support post 26 to permit water downflow, but to prevent upward backflow from the heating unit 34 toward the reservoir 30 . The heating unit 34 , although depicted generally in FIG. 6 by dotted lines, comprises a standard dual pathway device of the type known in the art for use in coffee brewers. In particular, the heating unit 34 incorporates an electrical resistance heating element mounted within one annular pathway and disposed in heat transfer relation with water flow through an adjacent annular pathway. One exemplary dual pathway heating unit of this general type is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,956, which is incorporated by reference herein. With this construction, the water downflow through the post passage 50 is circulated though the water pathway of the heating unit 34 which heats the water substantially to boiling. A downstream end of the water pathway through the heating unit 34 is coupled to a second flow passage 52 (FIG. 6) for upward or return flow to the brewer head 28 . The upward return flow passage 52 through the support post 26 delivers the heated water through a short transition conduit 54 to an inverted, generally U-shaped turn 56 positioned within the water reservoir 30 and disposed at least slightly above a maximum fill level of the reservoir. This inverted and elevated conduit turn 56 prevents water within the reservoir 30 from draining past the turn 56 when the reservoir is filled with water. A downstream end of the inverted conduit turn 56 is coupled by an additional supply conduit 58 to a second check valve 60 mounted at the underside of the upper bowl 29 to permit one-way flow-through passage of water from the supply conduit 58 to brew basket 12 , but prevents backflow of water to the conduit 58 . More particularly, the second check valve 60 is positioned in aligned relation with an inflow port 62 (FIGS. 3 and 6) formed in the bottom wall of the upper housing bowl 29 , at a location generally centered within the brew basket cavity 32 . In this regard, as shown best in FIGS. 8 and 10, the brew basket 12 includes a downwardly open feed port 64 having a size and shape for seated reception on the underlying inflow port 62 , when the brew basket 12 is positioned within the brew cavity 32 . This feed port 64 communicates water inflow from the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 of the brew basket 12 . The brew basket 12 may comprise a generally bowl-shaped component constructed primarily from lightweight molded plastic or the like, to provide a generally upwardly open geometry defined by a bottom wall 66 joined to an upstanding side wall 68 of generally cylindrical configuration. The bottom wall 68 is formed to include the downwardly open feed port 64 for communicating hot water inflow upwardly into a false bottom or plenum chamber 70 (FIG. 10) which distributes the hot water flow to at least one and preferably a plurality of hollow ribs 72 formed in the side wall 68 . In the preferred configuration as shown, three of said hollow ribs 72 are formed in the side wall 68 at approximate 120° intervals, and each of these ribs 72 includes a closed upper end and has at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed along the height thereof for jetting hot water streams into the interior of the brew basket 12 . FIGS. 6-7 and 9 - 10 illustrate each hollow rib 72 with a pair of vertically spaced jet ports 14 positioned and aimed for jetting water streams generally tangentially in a common swirling direction (clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 9) into the brew basket interior. At least the lower jet ports 14 on the hollow ribs 72 are positioned at a level below a normal level or upper surface of a bed of dry coffee grounds placed into the brew basket 12 for brewing coffee, as indicated approximately by the dotted line 74 in FIG. 10. Thus, when the hot water is jetted through the jet ports 14 , at least a portion of the hot water stirs and agitates the body of coffee grounds to initiate a swirling or spinning action to create the fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. That is, upon initial supply of hot water into the brew basket 12 , water passing through the lower jets 14 stirs and agitates the initially dry coffee grounds, whereas the upper jets may be disposed above the upper surface of the coffee grounds and thereby initially spray onto and wet that upper surface. As hot water flow continues, the brew basket 12 gradually fills substantially with water, while the agitating and stirring action of the lower jets continues. As the brew basket fills with water, the water level eventually increases to a point higher than the upper jets 14 , as indicated approximately by the dotted line 76 in FIG. 10, whereby the upper and lower jets 14 cooperatively stir and agitate the combined body of coffee grounds and water to suspend and swirl the coffee grounds in the form of a water-borne fluidized dispersion. Such action exposes the entire volume of the coffee grounds to the heated water thoroughly and substantially uniformly, and for substantially for the entire period of the brew cycle, to result in a significantly improved and consistently high quality brewed coffee beverage. A removable cap 77 is normally provided to close the top of the brew basket 12 and thereby prevent undesired spilling of water or coffee grounds therefrom during the brewing procedure. In one preferred form as illustrated in FIG. 11, the jets ports 14 formed along the hollow ribs 72 of the brew basket 12 may be designed for minimizing or eliminating undesirable inflow or ingestion of particle-laden coffee when the supply of hot water to the jet ports 14 terminates. As shown in FIG. 11, each jet port 14 can be shaped to define a tapered profile with a cross sectional size that reduces toward a downstream or discharge end thereof, in combination with a filter screen 15 which can be formed as by in-place plastic molding generally at an upstream or inlet end of the jet port 14 . Upon supply of hot water to the jet port, the water passes freely through the filter screen 15 and then outwardly through the jet port 14 at a substantial velocity for intermixing with the coffee grounds within the brew basket. Upon cessation of the hot water flow, any particulate grounds which may flow or be drawn into the jet port 14 are collected on the downstream side of the filter screen 15 , where they cannot clog internal flow passages of the coffee maker apparatus. Instead, such collected grounds are retained on the screen 15 where they are hydraulically delivered back into the brew basket 12 during a subsequent brew cycle. Alternative structures for capturing ingested coffee grounds and/or for preventing backflow of such coffee grounds into and/or through the jet ports 14 will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. The thus-produced fluidized bed is swirled by centrifugal action against the inboard side of the brew basket side wall 68 , a portion of which is defined by one or more mesh or mesh-like filter elements 78 . Such filter elements 78 are supported by the brew basket 12 in slightly spaced relation to the adjacent divider wall 36 to define a flow pathway for brewed coffee to pass therebetween to a drip outlet port 79 (FIG. 6) formed in the upper bowl 29 and an underlying drip outlet port 80 (FIGS. 5-6) formed in the lower shell 39 . This latter outlet port 80 is positioned over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 , whereby the brewed coffee flows downwardly for collection within the pot 20 . As viewed in FIGS. 1-6, the brew basket cavity 32 formed in the upper housing bowl 29 may intersect and thereby interrupt a forward region of the bowl 29 , to form an arcuate recess 83 to expose a frontal portion or segment 82 of the brew basket 12 at a front side of the brewer head 28 . In this regard, this exposed frontal segment 82 of the brew basket 12 is desirably formed from a transparent or partially transparent material to permit visual observation of the swirling and spinning fluidized bed during the brewing procedure. A lower margin of the recess 83 in the upper bowl 29 is disposed above the drip outlet port 79 . The removable cap 77 may also be formed from a transparent or partially transparent material. In use, to brew a pot of coffee, a selected volume of water is poured into the water reservoir 30 , and the brew basket 12 containing a selected quantity of ground coffee is placed into the associated brew basket cavity 32 in the brewer head 28 . A portion of the water within the reservoir 30 will flow downwardly through the first check valve 45 to fill the associated pathway within the heating unit 34 . Then, upon depression of the on-off button 22 , the heating unit 34 is energized to raise the temperature of the water therein substantially to boiling, resulting in pressure-forced pumping the hot water upwardly through the inverted and elevated inverted conduit turn 56 and further through the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 within the brew basket 12 . This upwardly pumped water is replaced by continued water downflow from the reservoir 30 , for heating by the heating unit 34 , until the reservoir 30 reaches a substantially empty condition. The hot water is jetted into the interior of the brew basket 12 via the jet ports 14 , as described, to generate the swirling turbulent fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. The thus-brewed coffee is filtered through the mesh filter elements 78 for delivery into the underlying pot 20 , wherein the brewed coffee may be retained in a heated state by suitably controlling the heating unit 34 for heating the platen 18 . Alternately, the heating unit 34 may be designed to de-activate and the brewed coffee may be retained within an insulated decanter. Following this brew cycle, the brew basket 12 may be removed from the brewer head 28 for appropriate cleaning and discarding of the spent coffee grounds retained on the filter elements. Thereafter, the brew basket 12 may be refilled with coffee grounds for a subsequent brew cycle. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention thus produces brewed coffee by means of intimately thorough and consistent intermixing between the hot water and coffee grounds, to produce a coffee beverage of repeatable high quality taste and other characteristics. In addition, because the heated water passes directly into the coffee grounds, the resultant steam rising from the fluidized bed is believed to carry enhanced or intensified coffee aroma, thereby producing an enhanced of more enjoyable coffee brewing experience. A variety of further modifications and improvements in and to the coffee brewer 10 of the present invention will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art. Accordingly, no limitation on the invention is intended by way of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings, except as set forth in the appended claims.","RE45476"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to improvements in devices and systems for brewing coffee or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved coffee brewer utilizing streams of heated water for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds, to yield brewed coffee having improved flavor and enhanced aroma and other characteristics. Drip-style coffee brewers are available in a wide range of different configurations and sizes for use in residential or commercial environments to produce brewed coffee. Such coffee brewers commonly include a water reservoir from which a controlled volume of water is heated and then dispensed downwardly by dripping or spraying onto coffee grounds contained within an underlying, upwardly open brew basket. The hot water intermixes with the coffee grounds to produce the desired brewed coffee beverage which is drained from the brew basket through a filter element into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In one common form, the brewer includes a refillable water reservoir from which the water is delivered through a heating element for drip-flow dispensing into the brew basket. Alternately, the brewer may be coupled directly to a tap water supply or the like. While drip-style coffee brewers of the above described type have been used extensively for many years, the flavor and other characteristics of the brewed coffee is inconsistent and, in many cases, can be of marginal or unacceptable quality. Such problems are believed to stem from inadequate and/or inconsistent intermixing of the hot water with the coffee grounds contained in the brew basket, resulting in brewed coffee exhibiting inconsistent flavor and body traits, often including unacceptable bitter taste attributes. In this regard, the downward dispensing of hot water onto the initially dry coffee grounds in the underlying brew basket can produce erosion-type channels through the coffee grounds, wherein such channels can permit a significant portion of the water volume to pass through the coffee grounds and drip from the brew basket without significantly wetting or otherwise adequately intermixing therewith. While this channeling problem can sometimes be mitigated by carefully pre-distributing the coffee grounds substantially uniformly within the brew basket, significant attention to this aspect of the coffee brewing process is seldom given. A variety of modified coffee brewers and related brewing processes have been provided in an attempt to overcome these problems and disadvantages by providing improved intermixing between the heated water and the coffee grounds within a filtered brew basket. In general, such concepts utilize mechanical stirring devices for improving thorough contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds. While such concepts may provide brewed coffee with enhanced and/or more consistent flavor characteristics, they inherently incorporate moving parts that increase the overall complexity and cost of the coffee brewer, and are susceptible to occasional break-down to require periodic repair or replacement. There exists, therefore, a continuing need for further improvements in and to coffee brewers and related coffee brewing processes for achieving significantly improved intermixing between heated water and coffee grounds, for providing brewed coffee of consistent high quality and improved flavor and other desirable attributes, without requiring mechanical stirring devices and their attendant disadvantages. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, an improved coffee brewer and brewing method are provided for producing brewed coffee with improved flavor. The coffee brewer includes a removably mounted brew basket having jet ports connected to a source of heated water and positioned to deliver hot water streams into the brew basket at a location for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds contained therein to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds for improved flavor extraction. This fluidized bed is directed against one or more mesh filter elements forming a wall portion of the brew basket for outward passage of the thus-produced coffee which is then directed into an underlying carafe or the like. In one preferred form, the coffee brewer includes a water reservoir coupled via a first check valve for flow in heat transfer relation with a heating unit. The heating unit elevates the temperature of the water substantially to the boiling point, whereupon the heated water flows through a second check valve to the brew basket. The heated water flows to and through the jet ports into the interior of the brew basket, with at least some of the jet ports being disposed at a position beneath the level of coffee grounds contained therein. As a result, the heated water is jetted or sprayed into and thoroughly wets the coffee grounds with an agitating and stirring action that is effective to lift, suspend, and turbulently stir the grounds in a manner to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne grounds. In the preferred form, the jet ports are oriented for rotationally stirring the coffee grounds with a substantial spinning or orbital path of motion. The fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds provides improved and consistent intermixing of the heated water with the coffee grounds for enhanced flavor extraction with minimal bitter and/or other undesirable attributes. This spinning fluidized bed is directed by centrifugal action in a generally radially outward direction against an inboard side wall of the brew basket, a portion of which is defined by the mesh filter element or elements which permit outward flow-through passage of the brewed liquid coffee while substantially preventing outward passage of the coffee grounds. The brewed coffee passed through the filter element or elements is directed further as by gravity flow into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention, a frontal portion of the brew basket side wall comprises a substantially transparent window visible from the exterior of the coffee brewer, when the brew basket mounted is thereon. During a brewing cycle, the spinning fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket is thus externally observable. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying drawings illustrate the invention. In such drawings: FIG. 1 is a side perspective view illustrating a coffee brewer in accordance with the present invention, with a carafe positioned beneath an overlying head of the coffee brewer for drip-flow reception of brewed coffee; FIG. 2 is a front perspective view of the coffee brewer of FIG. 1, with the carafe removed; FIG. 3 is a top perspective view of the coffee brewer, with a hinged lid on the brewer head disposed in an open position to expose an underlying reservoir for pour-in reception of a volume of water for use in brewing coffee; FIG. 4 is another top perspective view similar to FIG. 3, but depicting additional removal of a brew basket and cap therefor, to expose an upwardly open cavity on the brewer head for removably supporting the brew basket; FIG. 5 is another top perspective view similar to FIG. 4, but showing further removal of an upper housing member of the brewer head, to exposed underlying water flow conduits; FIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view of the coffee brewer; FIG. 7 is a top perspective view of the brew basket; FIG. 8 is a bottom perspective view of the brew basket; FIG. 9 is a top plan view of the brew basket; FIG. 10 is a vertical sectional view taken generally on the line 10 - 10 of FIG. 9; and FIG. 11 is an enlarged fragmented sectional view showing a jet port in accordance with one preferred form of the invention, wherein heated water is jetted through the jet port into the brew basket. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As shown in the exemplary drawings, an improved coffee brewer referred to generally in FIGS. 1-6 by the reference numeral 10 is provided for rapid and consistent high quality brewing of coffee. The coffee brewer 10 includes a brew basket 12 (FIGS. 4-10) for receiving a selected quantity of ground coffee (not shown). In accordance with a primary aspect of the invention, the brew basket 12 is adapted for connection to a source of heated water, and includes at least one and preferably a plurality of jet ports 14 (FIGS. 7 and 9 - 11 ) positioned for agitating and turbulently stirring the coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of suspended and water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket 12 . This fluidized bed results in substantially improved and intimately thorough wetting contact and intermixing between the hot water and the coffee grounds, for achieving enhanced flavor extraction to consistently produce a high quality, fuller-bodied and more robust coffee beverage. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention is shown generally in one preferred form in FIGS. 1-6. As depicted, the coffee brewer 10 comprises a relatively compact base 16 having a platen 18 formed or carried thereon with a size and shape suitable for secure rested support of a coffee pot 20 such as a carafe or decanter or the like. An on-off button 22 is exposed at a front side of the base 16 and may be depressed manually when brewing of a pot of coffee is desired, as will be described in more detail. A power cord 24 (FIG. 1) protrudes rearwardly from the base 16 for connecting the brewer 10 to a suitable electrical power source. A support post 26 extends upwardly from a rear side of the base 16 to support an upper brewer head 28 in a positioned generally cantilevered over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 supported on the base platen 18 . In general terms, the brewer head 28 comprises a relatively compact housing structure defining a water reservoir 30 (FIGS. 3-4) for receiving a selected volume of water for use in brewing a pot of coffee, in combination with an upwardly open cavity 32 (FIGS. 4-6) for removably supporting the brew basket 12 . Upon depression of the on-off button 22 , water within the reservoir 30 is delivered in heat exchange relation with a heating unit 34 shown mounted within the base 16 as viewed in FIG. 6, and further to the brewer basket jet ports 14 for delivery into the interior of the brew basket 12 in the form of a plurality of pressurized or jetted hot water streams. These hot water jets turbulently stir and intermix with coffee grounds contained within the brew basket 12 to produce the fluidized bed or suspension of coffee grounds within a spinning and swirling body of water within the brew basket, to produce the improved, high quality, and consistent coffee beverage in accordance with the invention. This coffee beverage is filtered and delivered from the brew basket to the underlying coffee pot or carafe 20 , ready for immediate use and enjoyment. More particularly, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 3-6, the illustrative brewer head 28 includes an upper housing bowl 29 with an internal, generally vertically oriented divider wall 36 subdividing the brewer head 28 into the upwardly open water reservoir 30 occupying a rearward region of the head 28 , and the brewer basket cavity 32 at a forward region of the head 28 . A rear hinged lid 38 is provided on the brewer head 28 for normally closing the water reservoir 30 , but this lid 38 is adapted for quick and easy pivoting movement to an open position (as viewed in FIGS. 3-4) to permit a selected volume of water to be poured into the reservoir 30 . In a typical residential coffee maker, the reservoir 30 may be sized for receiving a standardized volume of water, such as a water volume sufficient to brew a standardized volume of coffee, such as 8, 10 or 12 cups. Alternately, the brewer head 28 may include volumetric gradation marks (not shown) indicating the volume of water contained therein, to facilitate brewing of different selected volumes of coffee. As a further alternative, persons skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the coffee brewer 10 may be connected directly to a tap water source or the like, in lieu of the reservoir 30 for pour-in reception of a selected water volume. The upper housing bowl 29 defining the water reservoir 30 is mounted on a lower housing shell 39 (shown best in FIGS. 5-6) which is supported at an upper end of the support post 26 in cantilevered relation spaced above the base 16 . Water within the reservoir 30 is coupled through a port 40 formed in a bottom wall of the upper bowl 29 (FIG. 6) to an underlying receiver 44 which is mounted on the lower shell 39 within a compartment 46 defined cooperatively between the upper bowl 29 and lower shell 39 . This receiver 44 may include a spring-loaded valve positioned for engagement by the upper bowl 29 for movement to an open position permitting downward water flow from the reservoir 30 , when the upper bowl 29 is mounted on the lower shell 39 . Such downward water flow proceeds through the receiver 44 and further through a short supply conduit 48 (FIGS. 5-6) which couples the water downflow to a passage 50 formed in the support post 26 and further to the heating unit 34 . A first check valve 45 (FIG. 6) is mounted along this passage 50 within the support post 26 to permit water downflow, but to prevent upward backflow from the heating unit 34 toward the reservoir 30 . The heating unit 34 , although depicted generally in FIG. 6 by dotted lines, comprises a standard dual pathway device of the type known in the art for use in coffee brewers. In particular, the heating unit 34 incorporates an electrical resistance heating element mounted within one annular pathway and disposed in heat transfer relation with water flow through an adjacent annular pathway. One exemplary dual pathway heating unit of this general type is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,956, which is incorporated by reference herein. With this construction, the water downflow through the post passage 50 is circulated though the water pathway of the heating unit 34 which heats the water substantially to boiling. A downstream end of the water pathway through the heating unit 34 is coupled to a second flow passage 52 (FIG. 6) for upward or return flow to the brewer head 28 . The upward return flow passage 52 through the support post 26 delivers the heated water through a short transition conduit 54 to an inverted, generally U-shaped turn 56 positioned within the water reservoir 30 and disposed at least slightly above a maximum fill level of the reservoir. This inverted and elevated conduit turn 56 prevents water within the reservoir 30 from draining past the turn 56 when the reservoir is filled with water. A downstream end of the inverted conduit turn 56 is coupled by an additional supply conduit 58 to a second check valve 60 mounted at the underside of the upper bowl 29 to permit one-way flow-through passage of water from the supply conduit 58 to brew basket 12 , but prevents backflow of water to the conduit 58 . More particularly, the second check valve 60 is positioned in aligned relation with an inflow port 62 (FIGS. 3 and 6) formed in the bottom wall of the upper housing bowl 29 , at a location generally centered within the brew basket cavity 32 . In this regard, as shown best in FIGS. 8 and 10, the brew basket 12 includes a downwardly open feed port 64 having a size and shape for seated reception on the underlying inflow port 62 , when the brew basket 12 is positioned within the brew cavity 32 . This feed port 64 communicates water inflow from the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 of the brew basket 12 . The brew basket 12 may comprise a generally bowl-shaped component constructed primarily from lightweight molded plastic or the like, to provide a generally upwardly open geometry defined by a bottom wall 66 joined to an upstanding side wall 68 of generally cylindrical configuration. The bottom wall 68 is formed to include the downwardly open feed port 64 for communicating hot water inflow upwardly into a false bottom or plenum chamber 70 (FIG. 10) which distributes the hot water flow to at least one and preferably a plurality of hollow ribs 72 formed in the side wall 68 . In the preferred configuration as shown, three of said hollow ribs 72 are formed in the side wall 68 at approximate 120° intervals, and each of these ribs 72 includes a closed upper end and has at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed along the height thereof for jetting hot water streams into the interior of the brew basket 12 . FIGS. 6-7 and 9 - 10 illustrate each hollow rib 72 with a pair of vertically spaced jet ports 14 positioned and aimed for jetting water streams generally tangentially in a common swirling direction (clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 9) into the brew basket interior. At least the lower jet ports 14 on the hollow ribs 72 are positioned at a level below a normal level or upper surface of a bed of dry coffee grounds placed into the brew basket 12 for brewing coffee, as indicated approximately by the dotted line 74 in FIG. 10. Thus, when the hot water is jetted through the jet ports 14 , at least a portion of the hot water stirs and agitates the body of coffee grounds to initiate a swirling or spinning action to create the fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. That is, upon initial supply of hot water into the brew basket 12 , water passing through the lower jets 14 stirs and agitates the initially dry coffee grounds, whereas the upper jets may be disposed above the upper surface of the coffee grounds and thereby initially spray onto and wet that upper surface. As hot water flow continues, the brew basket 12 gradually fills substantially with water, while the agitating and stirring action of the lower jets continues. As the brew basket fills with water, the water level eventually increases to a point higher than the upper jets 14 , as indicated approximately by the dotted line 76 in FIG. 10, whereby the upper and lower jets 14 cooperatively stir and agitate the combined body of coffee grounds and water to suspend and swirl the coffee grounds in the form of a water-borne fluidized dispersion. Such action exposes the entire volume of the coffee grounds to the heated water thoroughly and substantially uniformly, and for substantially for the entire period of the brew cycle, to result in a significantly improved and consistently high quality brewed coffee beverage. A removable cap 77 is normally provided to close the top of the brew basket 12 and thereby prevent undesired spilling of water or coffee grounds therefrom during the brewing procedure. In one preferred form as illustrated in FIG. 11, the jets ports 14 formed along the hollow ribs 72 of the brew basket 12 may be designed for minimizing or eliminating undesirable inflow or ingestion of particle-laden coffee when the supply of hot water to the jet ports 14 terminates. As shown in FIG. 11, each jet port 14 can be shaped to define a tapered profile with a cross sectional size that reduces toward a downstream or discharge end thereof, in combination with a filter screen 15 which can be formed as by in-place plastic molding generally at an upstream or inlet end of the jet port 14 . Upon supply of hot water to the jet port, the water passes freely through the filter screen 15 and then outwardly through the jet port 14 at a substantial velocity for intermixing with the coffee grounds within the brew basket. Upon cessation of the hot water flow, any particulate grounds which may flow or be drawn into the jet port 14 are collected on the downstream side of the filter screen 15 , where they cannot clog internal flow passages of the coffee maker apparatus. Instead, such collected grounds are retained on the screen 15 where they are hydraulically delivered back into the brew basket 12 during a subsequent brew cycle. Alternative structures for capturing ingested coffee grounds and/or for preventing backflow of such coffee grounds into and/or through the jet ports 14 will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. The thus-produced fluidized bed is swirled by centrifugal action against the inboard side of the brew basket side wall 68 , a portion of which is defined by one or more mesh or mesh-like filter elements 78 . Such filter elements 78 are supported by the brew basket 12 in slightly spaced relation to the adjacent divider wall 36 to define a flow pathway for brewed coffee to pass therebetween to a drip outlet port 79 (FIG. 6) formed in the upper bowl 29 and an underlying drip outlet port 80 (FIGS. 5-6) formed in the lower shell 39 . This latter outlet port 80 is positioned over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 , whereby the brewed coffee flows downwardly for collection within the pot 20 . As viewed in FIGS. 1-6, the brew basket cavity 32 formed in the upper housing bowl 29 may intersect and thereby interrupt a forward region of the bowl 29 , to form an arcuate recess 83 to expose a frontal portion or segment 82 of the brew basket 12 at a front side of the brewer head 28 . In this regard, this exposed frontal segment 82 of the brew basket 12 is desirably formed from a transparent or partially transparent material to permit visual observation of the swirling and spinning fluidized bed during the brewing procedure. A lower margin of the recess 83 in the upper bowl 29 is disposed above the drip outlet port 79 . The removable cap 77 may also be formed from a transparent or partially transparent material. In use, to brew a pot of coffee, a selected volume of water is poured into the water reservoir 30 , and the brew basket 12 containing a selected quantity of ground coffee is placed into the associated brew basket cavity 32 in the brewer head 28 . A portion of the water within the reservoir 30 will flow downwardly through the first check valve 45 to fill the associated pathway within the heating unit 34 . Then, upon depression of the on-off button 22 , the heating unit 34 is energized to raise the temperature of the water therein substantially to boiling, resulting in pressure-forced pumping the hot water upwardly through the inverted and elevated inverted conduit turn 56 and further through the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 within the brew basket 12 . This upwardly pumped water is replaced by continued water downflow from the reservoir 30 , for heating by the heating unit 34 , until the reservoir 30 reaches a substantially empty condition. The hot water is jetted into the interior of the brew basket 12 via the jet ports 14 , as described, to generate the swirling turbulent fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. The thus-brewed coffee is filtered through the mesh filter elements 78 for delivery into the underlying pot 20 , wherein the brewed coffee may be retained in a heated state by suitably controlling the heating unit 34 for heating the platen 18 . Alternately, the heating unit 34 may be designed to de-activate and the brewed coffee may be retained within an insulated decanter. Following this brew cycle, the brew basket 12 may be removed from the brewer head 28 for appropriate cleaning and discarding of the spent coffee grounds retained on the filter elements. Thereafter, the brew basket 12 may be refilled with coffee grounds for a subsequent brew cycle. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention thus produces brewed coffee by means of intimately thorough and consistent intermixing between the hot water and coffee grounds, to produce a coffee beverage of repeatable high quality taste and other characteristics. In addition, because the heated water passes directly into the coffee grounds, the resultant steam rising from the fluidized bed is believed to carry enhanced or intensified coffee aroma, thereby producing an enhanced of more enjoyable coffee brewing experience. A variety of further modifications and improvements in and to the coffee brewer 10 of the present invention will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art. Accordingly, no limitation on the invention is intended by way of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings, except as set forth in the appended claims.","7240611"

BACKGROUND Technical Field Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods for brewing coffee. Discussion of Art Coffee can be consumed as a hot or cold beverage. In order to produce cold coffee (e.g., coffee that is cooled below room temperature, such as to a temperature that is no greater than 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a variety of known techniques may be used. A cold brewing technique involves grinding coffee beans and placing the ground coffee beans into cold or room temperature water for a prolonged period of time. Typically, the coffee grounds are placed into the water for twelve hours or more. The coffee grounds are filtered out of the water and coffee that is either cool or at room temperature is produced. Because of the prolonged time needed for brewing the coffee using this technique, however, cold brewing may not be suitable for many applications. Additionally, because coffee beans include components such as caffeine, oils, and fatty acids that are more soluble at elevated temperatures but less soluble or insoluble at the temperatures at which the coffee is brewed using the cold brewing technique, the flavor profile of coffee produced using the cold brewing technique may not be desirable to many consumers. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then add ice to the hot coffee to cool the coffee to a lower temperature. This technique results in the coffee becoming diluted, which may not be desired by many consumers. Additionally, control over the flavor profile of the coffee can be difficult due to the inability to accurately control the amount of dilution of the coffee on a repeated basis. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then cool the coffee, such as by placing the coffee in a refrigerated container. One problem with this technique is that the time required to cool the coffee can be considerable. The longer the time period needed to cool the coffee, the more the coffee may oxidize. The oxidized coffee can provide a taste that is undesirable to many consumers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The subject matter described herein will be better understood from reading the following description of non-limiting embodiments, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein below: FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system for producing cold coffee; and FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for brewing cold coffee. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system 100 for producing cold coffee. The brewing system 100 is used to generate cold coffee within a relatively short time period without diluting the coffee or allowing the coffee to oxidize. As a result, the end product is cooled coffee produced in a short period of time and having a flavor profile that is the same as or closer to hot coffee than cold coffee brewed by other techniques. In one embodiment, the brewing system 100 can generate a large amount of cold coffee within a short time period, such as at least 35 gallons of cold coffee, at least 75 gallons of cold coffee, up to 150 gallons of cold coffee, up to 1,500 gallons of cold coffee, or another amount, within twenty minutes (or another period of time). Optionally (and as described below), the brewing system 100 may add a gas to the cold coffee, such as nitrogen, after brewing. The brewing system 100 includes a brewing tank 102 , such as a lauter tun or other container, that holds a filter body 104 . The brewing tank 102 forms an enclosure in which heated water is mixed with coffee grounds to brew hot coffee. In one embodiment, water is preheated in another tank and transferred to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, the water may be heated in the brewing tank 102 . For example, the brewing tank 102 may include one or more heating elements, or bodies that become heated and thereby heat the water in the tank 102 . The water may be heated to an elevated temperature suitable for brewing coffee. In one embodiment, the water is heated to a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit (or 93.3 degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the water may be heated to a temperature of 198 to 202 degrees Fahrenheit (or 92.2 to 94.4 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 198 and 202 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (or 90.6 to 96.1 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 190 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (or 87.8 to 98.9 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 190 and 210 degrees Fahrenheit. Optionally, another elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature) may be used. Some, but not all, of the heated water used for brewing coffee using the system 100 during the brewing of a single batch of coffee may be mixed with coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 . The amount of heated water that is equivalent to one third of the total amount of water used to brew coffee in a single batch may be added to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water may be added to the brewing tank 102 . For example, if seventy-five gallons of water are to be used in brewing coffee during a single batch, then twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water can be in the tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water can be added to the tank 102 , such as fifty gallons (or 190 liters) of water (e.g., when 150 gallons or 570 liters of water are used to brew coffee), 500 gallons (or 1900 liters) of water (e.g., when 1500 gallons or 5700 liters of water are used to brew coffee), or another amount can be added to the tank 102 . The coffee grounds may be relatively large size. For example, coffee beans may be ground such that, when the coffee grounds are passed through a ROTAP device, 69-75% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #20 and #30 sieves, 25-28% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #12 and #16 sieves, and 10-14% of the coffee grounds pass through a US Standard Size #30 sieve and into a pan or other collection device. Alternatively, the coffee grounds may be a smaller size. Coffee grounds are introduced into the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to begin brewing hot coffee. In one embodiment, sixty pounds (or twenty-seven kilograms) of ground coffee beans are mixed into twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water in the tank 102 . Alternatively, a greater or lesser amount of coffee grounds may be mixed with a greater or lesser amount of heated water. The amount of coffee grounds may be based on the amount of coffee to be brewed. For example, the amount of coffee grounds may increase with larger batches of coffee being brewed, and can decrease with smaller batches of coffee being brewed. The ratio of weight of heated water to coffee grounds used to brew the coffee may be a 10:1 ratio (e.g., seventy-five gallons of heated water and sixty pounds of ground coffee) in one embodiment. Alternatively, another ratio of heated water to may be used. For example, a ratio of at least 12:1 to no more than 8:1 may be used, a ratio of at least 11:1 to no more than 9:1 may be used, or another ratio may be used. The coffee grounds are agitated in the heated water in the tank 102 in one embodiment. This agitation may be performed manually, such as by an operator of the system 100 moving a paddle or other object in the tank 102 to agitate the coffee grounds. Alternatively, the agitation may be performed automatically or by machine implementation, such as by one or more motors moving one or more paddles within the tank 102 . Additional heated water is added to the tank 102 in one embodiment. The remaining amount of water used to brew the batch of coffee may be added. For example, if the amount of heated water that equals one third of the total amount of water to be used in brewing coffee is already in the tank 102 , then an amount of heated water that equals two thirds of the total amount of water to be used in brewing the coffee can be added to the tank 102 . Agitation of the coffee grounds in the water in the tank 102 can occur while the remaining heated water is introduced into the tank 102 . The coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a brewing time. This brewing time can vary to achieve different flavors of coffee, can vary based on the amount of coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 , and/or can vary based on the amount of heated water in the brewing tank 102 . In one embodiment, the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a time period of at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty minutes. Alternatively, a shorter or longer time period may be used. This time period may be referred to as a contact time. Once the brewing time is complete, a drain valve 106 opens. The drain valve 106 controls flow of the coffee brewed in the tank 102 (referred to as hot coffee or hot brewed coffee) through one or more conduits 108 in the system 100 . A first portion of the conduits 108 fluidly couples the brewing tank 102 with a filter 110 . Responsive to opening the drain valve 106 , the hot brewed coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 and flows through the first portion of the conduits 108 to the filter 110 . The filter 110 may be referred to as an in-line filter. The hot brewed coffee can flow through the filter body 104 , where at least some of the coffee grounds introduced into the brewing tank 102 are filtered or otherwise removed from the hot brewed coffee. The filter body 104 may be a metal filter or another type of filter. The coffee passing through the filter body 104 may include some additional coffee grounds, which are removed from the hot brewed coffee by the filter 110 . The hot brewed coffee flows through the filter 110 to remove remaining coffee grounds. The filter 110 may be a centrifugal filter or another type of filter. In one embodiment, the filter 110 is a twenty inch (or fifty-one centimeter) inline filter with a metal wedge wire micron 127 filter. Alternatively, another type of filter may be used. A pump 112 generates a suction force in the conduits 108 to draw the hot brewed coffee through the conduits 108 . The pump 112 can pull on the hot brewed coffee flowing out of the brewing tank 102 and through the filter 110 . The coffee exiting the filter 110 can be referred to as filtered coffee. The pump 112 can direct the filtered coffee (which may remain at an elevated temperature, such as the temperature at which the coffee was brewed or slightly less, such as five to ten degrees Fahrenheit less) through a second portion of the conduits 108 to a heat exchanger 114 . With the storage tank 102 and the pump 112 , a unique coffee brewing process is provided by the system 100 . This brewing process includes a first stage, immersion type of coffee brewing, where the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 (e.g., with the drain valve 106 remaining closed) for a first designated period of time. This first designated period of time may be approximately six minutes in one embodiment. Alternatively, a different period of time may be used, such as between five and seven minutes. The brewing process includes a subsequent, second stage of pressure assisted drip type of coffee brewing. This stage involves the coffee dripping out of a bed of coffee grounds formed on the filter body 104 in the storage tank 102 into the first portion of the conduits 108 . The coffee may be drawn through this bed of coffee grounds by the pressure or suction generated by the pump 112 . This second stage of the brewing process can last for a different, second designated period of time. This second designated period of time may be approximately nine to fourteen minutes. For example, the second designated period of time may be at least nine minutes and no more than fourteen minutes. Alternatively, the second designated period of time may be different, such as at least eight minutes and no more than fifteen minutes, at least seven minutes and no more than sixteen minutes, or another period of time. The heat exchanger 114 cools the filtered coffee to a designated reduced temperature. The heat exchanger 114 can be a plate-style heat exchanger that pumps water, glycol, or other fluids in channels that are separate from, but thermally coupled with, channels in the heat exchanger 114 through which the filtered coffee flows due to the pressure generated by the pump 112 . This allows the heat exchanger 114 to cool the hot and filtered coffee without diluting the coffee or changing the chemical constituents of the coffee. The heat exchanger 114 rapidly cools the filtered coffee in one embodiment. For example, the temperature of the filtered coffee may decrease by at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (or seventy-one degrees Celsius), by at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit (or sixty-six degrees Celsius), by at least 125 degrees Fahrenheit (or fifty-two degrees Celsius), by at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or thirty-eight degrees Celsius), or by another amount. In one embodiment, the filtered coffee is cooled during flow of the filtered coffee through the heat exchanger 114 to a temperature of forty degrees Fahrenheit (or four degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the filtered coffee may be cooled to another temperature, such as between thirty-eight and forty-two degrees Fahrenheit or three to six degrees Celsius, inclusive; between thirty-six and forty-four degrees Fahrenheit or two to seven degrees Celsius, inclusive; or another temperature. The filtered coffee is cooled rapidly and faster than the coffee would be cooled by storing the filtered coffee in a standard home refrigerator overnight or by pouring the coffee over ice. For example, filtered coffee may be cooled to the designated temperature in less than twenty minutes, less than fifteen minutes, less than ten minutes, or less than five minutes, depending on the heat exchanger 114 (e.g., the size of the heat exchanger 114 ). Keeping the total time for producing the cooled coffee relatively short can reduce the total contact time of the water and coffee with the coffee grounds. Allowing the water and coffee to remain in contact with the coffee grounds for longer time periods can significantly deteriorate the taste of the end result coffee, such as by producing a more bitter coffee than is achieved by shorter contact times between the coffee grounds and the water or coffee. Additionally, once the filtered coffee leaves the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may provide a sealed environment that does not expose the coffee to the ambient environment and/or oxygen until after the coffee is removed from the system 100 . This also can assist in producing a coffee having an improved flavor profile relative to coffee that is exposed to the ambient environment and/or oxygen during cooling or storage. The filtered coffee may be cooled without freezing or partially freezing the coffee, so that the cooled coffee exiting the heat exchanger 114 can continue to flow through a third portion of the conduits 108 to a storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the storage tank 116 can be referred to as a brite tank or bright tank. The cooled coffee is directed into the storage tank 116 by the pressure generated by the pump 112 . The time period between placing the coffee grounds into contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to placing or directing the cooled and filtered coffee into the storage tank 116 may be relatively short, such as twenty minutes or less, thirty minutes or less, or another amount of time. This short time period for brewing, filtering, and rapidly cooling the hot coffee may be used for large volumes of coffee, such as seventy-five gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, etc. The cold coffee may be brewed hot, filtered, and then cooled while not diluting the coffee or having the coffee stored in an environment that causes oxidation of the coffee for an extended period of time (e.g., more than twelve hours). Subsequent to the immersion brewing process in the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may reduce or prevent contact between the coffee and one or more constituents in the ambient environment (e.g., oxygen) by sealing the components of the system 100 from the external environment, as described above. This can assist in preventing the coffee from oxidizing or otherwise being chemically altered during the process described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the storage tank 116 is fluidly coupled with a gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can represent a tank of pressurized gas or a machine that generates the gas at an elevated pressure. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can store a gas that is introduced into the storage tank 116 to be mixed with the cooled coffee. For example, the gas source 118 may include nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas is held in the gas source 118 at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch (or at least 3.1 bar). A valve 120 is closed to prevent the gas in the gas source 118 from flowing into the storage tank 116 and is opened to allow the gas in the gas source 118 to flow into the storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the valve 120 is open prior to the coffee being introduced into the storage tank 116 in order to introduce the gas in the tank 116 . The storage tank 116 may be purged with the gas prior to transferring coffee into the tank 116 to achieve no less than 100 parts per billion of dissolved oxygen in the tank 116 at a pressure (or absence of pressure) of zero pounds pounds per square inch. The gas can be introduced into the tank 116 at a pressure of at least fourteen pounds per square inch, at least 14.5 pounds per square inch, at least fifteen pounds per square inch, or another pressure. This introduction of the gas prior to entry of the coffee into the tank 116 can charge (or at least partially fill) the tank 116 with the gas and purge oxygen from the tank 116 . The gas and cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 together in order to mix the gas with the cooled coffee. For example, nitrogen may be mixed in with the cooled coffee. Once the coffee is in the tank 116 , the pressure of the gas is supplied into the storage tank 116 can be increased to an elevated pressure, such as at least forty-five pounds per square inch, in one embodiment. Alternatively, the gas can be supplied into the storage tank 116 at another pressure, such as at least fifty-five pounds per square inch, at least thirty pounds per square inch, and/or up to sixth pounds per square inch, or another pressure. The gas may be supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least a designated period of time. Exposure of the coffee to the gas for such as extended period of time can assist in the coffee absorbing at least some of the gas while in the tank 116 . In one embodiment, the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least twenty-four hours. Another time period alternatively may be used. In one embodiment, a carbonating or carbonation stone is placed inside the storage tank 116 while the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 . The carbonating or carbonation stone may be added to the storage tank 116 to decrease the time that the cooled coffee is held in the storage tank 116 before serving at least some of the cooled coffee to one or more consumers. For example, without the carbonating or carbonation stone, the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for twenty-four hours while the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for four hours. In the illustrated embodiment, the system 100 includes a controller 122 that operates to control various components of the system 100 . The controller 122 represents hardware circuitry that includes and/or is electrically connected with one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits, or other electronic logic-based devices). The controller 122 is communicatively coupled with various components of the system 100 to allow the controller 122 to generate and communicate control signals that direct the components to implement various actions. For example, the controller 122 can be coupled with the drain valve 106 , the pump 112 , the heat exchanger 114 , and/or the valve 120 by one or more wired and/or wireless connections over or through which the controller 122 can transmit and/or broadcast control signals to control operations of these components. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the controller 122 , or may include several controllers 122 that separately control operations of different components of the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the drain valve 106 to change a state of the drain valve 106 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the drain valve 106 (or a motor or other device coupled with the drain valve 106 ) to open the drain valve 106 or to close the drain valve 106 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the drain valve 106 is open or closed. The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the pump 112 to activate or deactivate the pump 112 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the pump 112 (or a motor or other device of the pump 112 ) to turn on the pump 112 and cause the pump 112 to begin generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 or to turn the pump 112 off and stop the pump 112 from generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the heat exchanger 114 to activate or deactivate the heat exchanger 114 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the heat exchanger (or a motor or other device of the heat exchanger 114 ) to turn on the heat exchanger 114 and cause the heat exchanger 114 to begin cooling the coffee or to turn the heat exchanger 114 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the valve 120 to change a state of the valve 120 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the valve 120 (or a motor or other device coupled with the valve 120 ) to open the valve 120 or to close the valve 120 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the valve 120 is open or closed to control the flow of gas in the gas source 118 into the storage tank 116 . FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 200 for brewing cold coffee. The method 200 can be performed by the system 100 described herein to brew cold coffee in large amounts within a short time period without diluting the coffee or changing flavor of the hot coffee that is initially brewed (e.g., through oxidation). Optionally, the method 200 can represent an algorithm that is a software program or that is used to program one or more of the components of the system 100 to brew the cold coffee. At 202 , water is heated to an elevated temperature. As one example, the water can be heated to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit, as described above. The water can be heated in the brewing tank 102 or in another location. At 204 , a portion (and less than all) of the heated water is placed into the brewing tank. For example, one third of the total water used to brew a single batch of coffee (e.g., the 75 gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, or other amount) may be adding to the brewing tank 102 . At 206 , coffee grounds are added to the heated water in the brewing tank 102 . At 208 , the remainder of the heated water is added to the brewing tank 102 . During and/or after addition of the coffee grounds and water to the brewing tank 102 , the mixture of the coffee grounds and the water may be agitated, as described above. At 210 , hot coffee is brewed in the brewing tank 102 using immersion brewing. During this brewing, the water and coffee grounds remain in the brewing tank 102 so that the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water. At 212 , a determination is made as to whether the immersion brewing of the coffee in the brewing tank 102 is complete. If the immersion brewing is complete (e.g., the coffee grounds have been in contact with the heated water for a designated time period, as described above), then flow of the method 200 can proceed toward 214 . Otherwise, flow of the method 200 can return toward 210 so that immersion brewing can continue until complete. At 214 , a drain valve is opened in order to drain the hot coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The coffee drained from the brewing tank 102 is heated. For example, the coffee may be at an elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature, above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, above 150 degrees Fahrenheit to 205 degrees Fahrenheit, or another range of acceptable brewing temperatures) as the coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 . At 216 , a pump is activated to force the heated coffee through one or more conduits. The pump may be activated to being pressure assisted drip brewing of the coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The pump may be activated at the same time that the drain valve is opened, after the drain valve is opened, or prior to opening the drain valve in different embodiments. At 218 , the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 is filtered using multiple stage filters. For example, the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 may be drained from the brewing tank 102 through the filter body 104 in the brewing tank 102 and then filtered again using the inline filter 110 . Alternatively, the hot coffee may be filtered using more than two filters or using a single filter. At 220 , the coffee is rapidly cooled. The coffee can be cooled after the coffee has been filtered, as described above. Alternatively, the coffee can be cooled prior to filtering the coffee or between filters of a multi-stage filtering process. The coffee may be cooled within a relatively short time period without diluting or chemically altering the coffee, in contrast to cooling techniques involving mixing the coffee with ice, allowing the coffee to slowly cool (thereby resulting in oxidation), etc. The coffee can be cooled by flowing the coffee through one or more heat exchangers. At 222 , the cooled and filtered coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The coffee can be stored in the storage tank 116 for at least a designated time period (e.g., twenty-four hours), or may be immediately available for consumption following completion of the brewing of the batch of coffee (where the batch is completed when the water mixed with the coffee in the brewing tank 102 has reached the storage tank 116 ). The storage tank 116 may be sealed to reduce or eliminate contact between the coffee and the external environment to reduce or eliminate oxidation or other chemical changes to the coffee. As described above, the tank 116 may be purged with the gas (e.g., nitrogen) to remove oxygen from the tank 116 , the coffee may then be introduced into the tank 116 , and the pressure of the gas can be increased to the head pressure to cause the gas to be absorbed in the coffee in the tank 116 . At 224 , the coffee optionally may be mixed with a gas. For example, nitrogen can be directed into the storage tank 116 to mix with the coffee while the coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The mixture of coffee and the gas can provide a pleasant or desired taste to at least some consumers. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes adding a first portion of a total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to a brewing tank, subsequently adding the coffee grounds to the brewing tank, and adding a remaining portion of the total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee, filtering the hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee produces a batch amount of cooled coffee, where the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least seventy-five gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 150 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 1,500 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a ratio of ten to one of the hot water to the coffee grounds by weight. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes a multiple stage brewing process that includes an immersion brewing stage of the hot coffee and a pressure assisted drip brewing stage of the hot coffee. In one example, the pressure assisted drip brewing stage occurs over a longer time period than the immersion brewing stage. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water in a brewing tank, and wherein filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes additionally passing the hot coffee through an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes agitating a mixture of the coffee grounds and the hot water. In one example, the method also includes mixing the cooled coffee with nitrogen gas. In one example, the nitrogen gas is mixed with the cooled coffee at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas for at least twenty-four hours. In one example, mixing the cooled coffee with the nitrogen gas occurs in presence of a carbonating stone. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas in the presence of the carbonating stone for no more than six hours. In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, the brewing tank is a Lauter tun. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least seventy-five gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 150 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 1,500 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the one or more filters include multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, the one or more filters include a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, the one or more filters also include an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank.

The complete text of these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a coated coffee particle and to various items made using such coated coffee particles. Further, the coated coffee particle may be formed into a structured coffee composition suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers can find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. Single serving coffee makers such as those by Hamilton Beach, Cuisinart, Mr. Coffee and others are generally designed to make a single cup of coffee (but can make slightly larger volumes) using a single use ground, or powered, coffee composition. In some instances, the coffee compositions used in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be powered in nature, in other instances the coffee compositions utilized in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be contained in what is typically viewed as a single use coffee “cup.” In this instance, such a coffee “cup” container/structure can contain, but does not require, a built-in filter element that lines the inside surface of such a single “use” coffee cup container/structure. It should be noted that although such coffee cup containers/structures are viewed as single use, the end user or consumer can, and often does, use such single use coffee cups more than once. Other forms of coffee makers and methods for preparing coffee include, but are not limited to, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced whereby various manufacturers provide coffee in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, are provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “containers,” “cups,” and/or “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are really only designed to brew a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tabletted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. Moreover, when roast and ground (R&G) coffee is exposed to air and/or sunlight for significant amounts of time, it goes stale overtime and exhibits papery notes that are evidence thereof. Further, roast and ground coffee must also be packaged in air tight packaging (e.g., wherein the removal of most oxygen must be purged therefrom) to avoid oxidation occurring thereon causing the roast and ground coffee to become stale. In light of the above and in view of the current products available in the marketplace, it would be desirable to develop a coffee composition and one or more items made therefrom that utilize a combination of instant coffee with one or more of roast coffee and/or ground coffee to achieve a coffee composition able to withstand exposure to air and light over some time without staling while still maintaining the product's integrity in combination with providing faster disassociation when brewed, thereby advantageously providing a variety of consistent coffee products of varying strengths with the ability to also use less robust packaging therefor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided are coated coffee particles and to various items made using the coated coffee particles. In another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particles can be formed into a structured coffee compositions suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use one or more of the present embodiments. The general principles described herein can be applied to embodiments and applications other than those detailed below without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Therefore, the present embodiments are not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed or suggested herein. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety as though they are fully set forth herein. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the numerical properties set forth in the following specification and claims are approximations that can vary depending on the desired properties sought to be obtained in embodiments of the present invention. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations; the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported with relative precision. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from error found in their respective measurements. As noted above, the present invention relates to coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to various coffee compositions and to a variety of items made using such coffee compositions wherein the coffee composition is in the form of coated particulates as disclosed herein. In yet another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particulates can be formed into any three-dimensional coffee structure suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, old brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. Terminology: Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Non-Coffee Binder” means a material which improves the structural integrity of a coffee composition made in accordance with the present invention. “Non-Coffee Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc., or any one or more binders made from one or more coffee ingredients and some amount of water. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, liquid coffee concentrate, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. Ground roast coffee can also be referred to as “roast coffee, ground coffee, or even a combination of roast coffee and ground coffee”. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Coffee solids” means the coffee constituents that are extracted or extractable during the brewing of coffee. Unless indicated otherwise, the term coffee solids refers to both the dissolved coffee solids and suspended coffee solids (e.g., very small grinds or fines). “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee composition means that the coffee composition is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the composition, when the composition is in place in a brewing device so as to be contacted with water (hot, cold or any temperature therebetween) for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example, flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3 weight percent) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. Furthermore, instant coffee used in the present invention can be prepared by any convenient process, of which a variety of processes are known to those skilled in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Moreover, representative spray drying processes that can provide suitable instant coffee are disclosed in, for example, pages 382 through 513 of Sivetz & Foote, “Coffee Processing Technology,” Vol. I (Avi Publishing Co. 1963), U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,771,343, 2,750,998, and 2,469,553, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Other suitable processes for providing instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,436,227, 3,493,388, 3,615,669, 3,620,756, and 3,652,293, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. The instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention can be prepared form any single variety of coffees or a blend of different varieties, and can be decaffeinated or un-decaffeinated, and can be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic as necessary. Additionally, instant coffee has many forms: spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid. “Liquid coffee concentrate” or “liquid coffee extract” as used herein designates an aqueous extract of the roasted coffee beans wherein the solids content is substantially greater than used for direct consumption as a beverage. The coffee solids content may be from about 10 wt % to about 75 wt %. The term as used here indicates a concentrated coffee extract, irrespective of this being liquid or a solid deep frozen coffee concentrate. As is generally known coffee extracts are recovered by contacting roasted and ground coffee beans with water or an aqueous solution. On an industrial scale, the intention is to achieve high extraction efficiency leading to extraction of aroma substances, that is odorants and flavorings, from the ground coffee. The concentration method is not particularly limited and can be performed by a known method and apparatus, evaporation, membrane concentration, concentration under reduced pressure, freeze concentration, and the like. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3 grams to about 5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of espresso strength brewed coffee. In one embodiment, the present invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures can be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing can include about 70° C. to about 100° C., about 80° C. to about 99° C., about 85° C. to about 97° C., or about 90° C. to about 96° C. However, it is contemplated that brewing may take place in other brewers at high pressures of greater than 100° C. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce anywhere from about 4 to about 12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The coffee products of the present invention can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and can be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. For more information related to ADC brewers see, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Coated Coffee Particle The general inventive concepts encompass various embodiments that are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a coated coffee particle. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may include a ground roast coffee particle that is coated with a coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, and at least partially drying the granulated composition. Optionally, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure. Examples of coffee extracts for use in the solution of coffee extracts include, but are not limited to, liquid coffee concentrate and instant coffee. It has been found that by mixing a solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee and at least partially drying the granulated composition a plurality of coated ground roast coffee particles may be prepared. As used herein, the coated ground roast coffee particles may be referred to as coated coffee particles or coated particulates. Through the mixing of the solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee a portion of the ground roasted coffee is extracted. Accordingly, a matrix is formed that includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee on the ground roast coffee particles. Stated differently, the matrix is composed of compounds that originated from both the coffee exact and roast and ground coffee particles. In one or more embodiments, coffee exact may be prepared from an instant coffee, a liquid coffee concentrate, or a combination thereof. For the purpose of this specification, ground roast coffee particles that include a coating of the matrix or coffee extracts and extracts from the round roast coffee may be referred to as the coated ground roast coffee particles. The coating may also be referred to as a coffee extract and ground roast coffee extract matrix or simply the matrix. The coating at least partially covers the surface of the ground roast coffee particles and may fill in any cracks or crevices on the surface of the particle. The coating of the ground roast coffee particles may also bind the particles together to form a structured coffee composition. As indicated above, the matrix or coating of the ground roast coffee particles compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. This mixture may be experimentally shown via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR analysis shows a peak that corresponds with a wavelength of 940 nm in the coffee coating that is not present in coffee extracts such as those prepared from instant coffee. This peak is high in ground roasted coffee but is present in lower amounts in the coating. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the peak may be related to lipids present in the ground roast coffee, but it may also be a combination of lipids with other compounds that absorb in this region. Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/QTOF) analysis of the coffee coating and ground roast coffee particles, and the coffee extracts may also be used to show compositional differences. For example, coffee extracts such as instant coffee have an extremely low amount of lipids and a different compositional background compared to roast and ground coffee. The presence of high amounts of lipids and/or composition similar to roast and ground coffee but different from instant would indicate a solvent was used. Further, visual appearance of the coating through by surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy or other surface measuring techniques may be used to identify that the coating of coffee extracts was added using a solvent. Visual appearance may also suggest that a solvent was used. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of problems solved, the coated coffee particle advantageously provides a solution to one or more of the following problems: (a) fast disassociation in hot or cold water; (b) the creation of a larger surface area via capillary action creating void spaces due to solution of the instant component; (c) significantly higher percentages brew solids (BS) are achieved with less coffee weight and volume; (d) delivery of improved brew profile and rich color early in brew; (e) consistent results across a full range of brew methods (i.e., ADC, single serve, French Press, cup infuser, cold brew); (f) the structured coffee composition may be prepared with 100 percent coffee or coffee related flavorings / additives; (g) coffee flavor of instant coffee portion of the composition is enhanced by extraction of flavor notes from ground roast component; (h) cold brewing can be achieved with significantly less volumes of coffee and shorter brew times (e.g., about 2 to about 4 hours or about 2 to about 3 hours for a pitcher); and (i) the product stays fresher longer (less staling perception) when stored in low barrier packaging. Ingredients: Ground Roast Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be prepared from ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “ Arabica ( s )”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “ Robusta ( s )”). See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in its entirety. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of ground coffees produced from the coffee beans discussed above can be used to make the structured coffee composition. Further, mixtures of two or more different varieties, or types, of ground coffees described above can also be used in combination to prepare the structured coffee composition. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12 weight percent. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology, “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112 to 169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. In other embodiments, the coffee been may be “pre-dried” prior to roasting. In these or other embodiments, the coffee beans may be dried to a moisture content in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Exemplary methods of pre-drying a coffee bean are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,160,757 and 5,322,703 and which are both incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. This drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional or low moisture drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at a temperature in the range of about 70° F. to about 325° F. (21° C. to 163° C.), or from about 90° F. to about 300° F., or from about 120° F. to about 275° F., or even from about 160° F. to about 250° F. over drying times lasting about 1 minute to about 24 hours, or from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, or from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, or from about 3 hours to about 6 hours, or even from about 4 hours to about 5 hours. After drying the green coffee beans (and optionally pre-drying the coffee beans), the coffee beans to are typically processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of the present invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans can be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8° C. to about 371.1° C. (about 350° F. to about 700° F.), or about 176.8° C. to about 260° C. (about 350° F. to about 500° F.), or about 204.4° C. to about 232.2° C. (about 400° C. to about 450° F.), or about 260° C. to about 287.8° C. (about 500° C. to about 550° F.), or about 315.6° C. to about 348.9° C. (about 600° C. to about 660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and can, for example, be about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or about 12 minutes to about 18 minutes, or can be about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 6 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 4 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and can, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1 minutes to about 3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° F. to about 1200° F. (about 177 C to about 649° C.), or from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, or from about 10 seconds to about 47 seconds. As is well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer ., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee that is used to make the structured coffee composition can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, or from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, or even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as about 250 μm (microns) and as high as about 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of about 400 μm to about 2,500 μm, or from about 500 μm to about 2,400 μm, or from about 650 μm to about 2,200 μm, or from about 800 μm to about 2,000 μm, or from about 900 μm to about 1,00 μm, or from about 1,000 μm to about 1,600 μm, or from about 1,200 μm to about 1,400 μm, or even about 1,300 μm. The coffee beans can be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to about 1.5 mm, or from about 300 μm to about 1,600 μm, or even from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles can be broken down during three-dimensional shape molding, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the molded structure formed from the various coffee compositions described herein. In one or embodiments, the size of the ground roast coffee particles may be described with reference to the size range of the coffee typically employed for a particular brewing method. In one or more embodiments, the ground roast coffee particles may be a coarse grind typically used for French press or percolator coffee brew, for example (e.g., about 900 microns to about 1400 microns), a medium-coarse grind typically used for pour over brewers, flat bottom drip brewer or ADC, or Aeropress, for example, (e.g., about 800 microns to about 1200 microns), a medium grind typically used for clever dripper, café solo, or single serve brewer, for example, (e.g., about 500 microns to about 900 microns), a medium fine grind typically used for Turkish coffee, for example, (e.g., about 200 microns to about 550 microns) or a super fine grind typically used for espresso, or moka pot, for example (e.g., about 200 microns to about 450 microns), or any one or more combinations thereof based on the desired type of coffee beverage and coffee strength. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by full particle size distribution curve. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than about 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. In one or more embodiment the roast ground coffee particles may be prepared using mill flaking. Mill flaking technology or mill flaking is a unique grinding process that creates a larger surface area on each flake for hot water to easily extract more of our coffee flavor. Flaked coffee is further disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,676, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/mL to about 0.35 g/mL such as, for example, about 0.263 g/mL, about 0.288 g/mL, about 0.325 g/mL, or even about 0.35 g/mL, if desired. Alternatively, the structured coffee composition can also be made for ground roast coffees having lower or higher densities, if desired. For example, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from high density coffees having densities of greater than about 0.40 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of up to about 0.60 g/cm 3 , although even higher densities are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. Similarly, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from low density coffees having densities of less than about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 to about 0.25 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.22 g/cm 3 to about 0.23 g/cm 3 (such as about 0.19 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 , about 0.21 g/cm 3 , about 0.22 g/cm 3 , about 0.23 g/cm 3 , about 0.24 g/cm 3 or even about 0.25 g/cm 3 ). Furthermore, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from higher density coffees having densities from about 0.39 g/cm 3 to about 0.57 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.40 g/cm 3 to about 0.56 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.46 g/cm 3 to about 0.48 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.47 g/cm 3 . In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3.5 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.75 to about 4.25 weight percent. In one instance, the inventive coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.6 weight percent, or from about 2.85 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or even from about 4.5 weight percent to about 4.85 weight percent. Generally speaking, the structured coffee composition can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, in one embodiment it is desirable that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular,” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. In another instance, embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the coffee compositions of the present invention is/are decaffeinated are also within the scope of the present invention. In one or more embodiments, the amount of one or more ground roast coffees (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the structured coffee composition used are in the range of about 60 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, or from about 65 weight percent to about 87.5 weight percent, or from about 70 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, or from about 72.5 weight percent to about 82.5 weight percent, or from about 75 weight percent to about 80 weight percent even about 77.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Instant Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include instant coffee. The instant coffee may be used to form a slurry in the preparation of the structured coffee composition by adding water to an instant coffee. The slurry is then combined with roast and ground coffee. It has been found that when an instant coffee is included in the structured coffee composition, the instant coffee may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. The presence of instant coffee in coffee compositions and/or structures can be detected by a number of different methods. However, one method is described in R. M. Noyes and C. M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee product to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. See various methods of detecting presence of instant coffee also as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different instant coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the method of which the instant coffee is prepared and other factors. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of less than 7 weight percent, or less than 6.5 weight percent, or less than 6 weight percent, or of less than 5.5 weight percent, or of less than 5 weight percent, or less than 4.5 weight percent, or of less than 4 weight percent, or less than 3.5 weight percent, or of less than 3 weight percent. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of about 0.5 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.5 to about 4.25 weight percent. Suitable instant coffee for use in the structured coffee composition include, but are not limited to, spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid instant coffees. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the yield of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high yield instant coffee, a medium yield instant coffee, or a low yield instant coffee. High yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of greater than 45%. High yields instant coffees may be obtained using a primary and then a secondary extract with high water temperatures. Typically, high yield instant coffees include a high robusta content to maximize extraction yield. Medium yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of between 25% to 45%. Typically, medium yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content with a minimal robusta content. Low yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of less than 25%. Low yield instant coffees may be obtained using only a primary extraction at temperatures generally at or below 100 ° C. Typically, low yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%). In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the quality of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high quality instant coffee or a low quality instant coffee. High quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that produce a cup of brewed coffee with an aroma similar to a roast and ground coffee and have a flavor with minimal processed and Carmel notes. Typically, high quality instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%) and are produced at a low extraction yield. Low quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that have a dull or unexciting flavor that may taste stale. Typically, low quality instant coffees include a high robusta content and are produced at a high extraction yield. In some embodiments a low yield, high quality instant coffee is used. In another embodiment a high yield instant coffee is used. The structured coffee composition may employ a variety and types of instant coffee can be used, including a high yield, high quality instant coffee, a high yield, low quality instant, or a low yield, low quality instant, or one or more combinations thereof any one or more instant coffee varieties and types of instant coffee. Exemplary instant coffees can be used with the present invention to make the coffee composition, including but not limited to, those as shown below in Table 1.

In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee that may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, instant coffees may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Liquid Coffee Concentrate As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include a liquid coffee concentrate. Liquid coffee concentrates may be purchased commercially or prepared prior to inclusion in the structured coffee composition. It has been found that when a liquid coffee concentrate is included in the preparation of a structured coffee composition, the liquid coffee concentrate may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. In one or more embodiments, a liquid coffee concentrates may be prepared by concentrating the draw-off stream from a liquid extraction process. This process utilizes hot and/or cool water and and/or steam to extract soluble coffee from roast and ground coffee. The liquid stream may then be concentrated by either thermal evaporation or freeze concentration or an alternate method. The concentrated stream of liquid coffee extract can be utilized to create a slurry, or with a roast and ground coffee with or without adding additional process water. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. An exemplary liquid coffee concentrate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,113,643, which is incorporated herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, a commercially available liquid coffee concentrate may be employed in the structured coffee composition. Liquid coffee concentrate is often sold in frozen form, and may be thawed prior to being combined with roast and ground coffee. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be characterized by the percent of coffee solids in the total volume of the liquid coffee concentrate. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may have coffee solids in an amount of about 10% to about 75%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 15% to about 70%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 20% to about 65%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 25% to about 60%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 30% to about 58%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 35% to about 55%,and in other embodiments in an amount of about 40% to about 50%. The amount of liquid coffee concentrate that may be included in the structured coffee composition should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least property such as binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, and staling resistance. In one or more embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on the overall weight of the total weight of structured coffee composition. Additional Additives The coated coffee particles may include on or more additional ingredients. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the structured coffee composition (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context.). Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included and, surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee products. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290; 6,277,428; 6,090,431; 1,951,357, and EP 813816, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. While binders included in certain embodiments, in other embodiments the structured coffee composition is free of non-coffee binders. In one or more embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added during the step of mixing the one or more ground roast coffee and the solution of one or more coffee extracts. In other embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added to the structured coffee composition (e.g., after the step of drying). Flavorants, both liquid and solid (or dry), can be included in the structured coffee products in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Crème Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. The flavorants that can be used include those known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavorants. A solid sweetener such as white granulated sugar may be used in connection with the structured coffee product. Examples of a whitening agent that can be used in connection with the structured coffee products include liquid dairy components and dry dairy components. Other suitable sweeteners that can be used in connection with the structured coffee compositions are those well known in the art, including both natural and artificial sweeteners, including but not limited to also high intensity sweeteners. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,706,785; 10,182,583; and 10,278,407, which disclose flavorants, sweeteners, and whitening agents for inclusion into the structured coffee products. These patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, where the coated coffee particle is in a structured coffee composition, the structured coffee composition may be made with one or more layers of additives, for example, coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers on a side of the structured coffee composition (e.g., the top, bottom, or any side or rounded face of the structured coffee composition). In these or other embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers that bisect or are situated between two portions of the coffee composition in the structured coffee composition. In other various embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be made with one or more various elements including the coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc., wherein the structured coffee composition is a homogenous mixture of any one or more of the foregoing included therein. Method of Making a Coated Coffee Particle: As indicated above, the coated coffee particles may be prepared by mixing a solution of brewed coffee extracts with ground coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. In one or more embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts may be prepared from instant coffee. In these or other embodiments, the instant coffee may be mixed with a solvent to prepare the solution of brewed coffee extracts. Suitable solvents for used in preparing the solution of brewed coffee extracts include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, brewed extracts from coffee, tea, juice, carbonated water, nitrogen infused water, and liquid CO 2 , among others. Any suitable method of mixing the instant coffee and the solvent may be used. Generally, the instant coffee and the solvent are mixed until smooth and uniform consistency is achieved. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using an instant coffee may be a slurry. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent may be from about 4:1 to about 1:2, in other embodiments from about 3:1 to about 1:1.75, in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 1:1.5, in other embodiments from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.25, in other embodiments from about 1.15:1 to about 1:15.1, in other embodiments from about 1.1:1 to about 1:1.1, and in other embodiments from about 1.05:1 to about 1:1.05. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of brewed coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, liquid coffee concentrate may be used as or to prepare the solution of coffee extract(s). In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee extract may be used as prepared (i.e. the product of an extraction and an optional concentration). In other embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be diluted with a solvent. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extracts prepared using a liquid coffee concentrate may be a slurry. Regardless, in one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may include a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. For example, a solution of coffee extracts may be prepped by combining a solution prepared by combining instant coffee and a solvent with a liquid coffee concentrate. In other embodiments, the instant coffee may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate to prepare a solution of coffee extracts. The ranges and amount of coffee solids provided above for the liquid coffee concentrate may be used in a solution of coffee extracts that includes a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. The solution of coffee extracts may then be combined with a ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Any suitable method of mixing the solution of coffee extracts and the ground roast coffee may be used. Suitable mixing device include, but are not limited to stand mixers, spatulas, and paddle mixers. In certain embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may be sprayed on the ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Typically, prior to drying the granulated composition may be described as sticky. In one or more embodiments, the amount of solution of coffee extracts and the amount of ground roast coffee in the granulated composition may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the weight of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract(s) to the weight of the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the ratio of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts to the ground roast coffee may be from about 10:90 to about 40:60, in other embodiments from about 12.5:87.5 to about 37.5:62.5, in other embodiments from about 15:85 to about 35:65, in other embodiments from about 17.5:82.5 to about 32.5:67.5, and in other embodiments from about 20:80 to about 30:70. After the granulated composition it may be formed or otherwise shaped into a structure. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into an agglomerate with a random shape. In other embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed or molded into geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure using a press or a die. Suitable presses include a Carver Press, for example Model #3912. In these or other embodiments, a low amount of pressure or compaction should be employed in the forming of the structure so the resultant structured coffee composition is not completely compressed and includes a level of porosity. For example, a de minimis amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a pressure that slightly exceeds 0 pounds per square inch (PSI). In other embodiments, an amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a compaction of the granulated composition of between 60% and 70%. For example, a portion of the granulation composition may be molded using a target compaction travel on a carver press of 94% which is calculated by taking the amount in millimeters of the 100 percent travel of the die assembly and multiplying by 0.94 to determine the amount of travel in millimeters to achieve a 94% compaction travel target using hand compaction until the target travel is achieved thereby resulting in a compaction of 60 percent to 70 percent of the granulated coffee. After the granulated composition is formed into a structure, it may be dried to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water or other solvents may be removed by air drying, microwave drying, infrared drying, etc. After the drying step a residual amount of water, moisture, or a combination thereof may remain in the coated coffee particles. The solvent content (i.e. water, other solvents, or a combination of water and other solvents) of the of the coated coffee particles may be determined by oven drying coupled with weight analysis to provide the most universal method across solvents, allowing one to measure percent loss of the solvent or Karl Fischer Titration. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a final solvent content of less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 9.75 weight percent, less than about 9.5 weight percent, less than about 9.25 weight percent, less than about 9 weight percent, less than about 8.75 weight percent, less than about 8.5 weight percent, less than about 8.25 weight percent, less than about 8 weight percent, less than about 7.75 weight percent, less than about 7.5 weight percent, less than about 7.25 weight percent, less than about 7 weight percent, less than about 6.75 weight percent, less than about 6.5 weight percent, less than about 6.25 weight percent, less than about 6 weight percent, less than about 5.75 weight percent, less than about 5.5 weight percent, less than about 5.25 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 4.75 weight percent, less than about 4.5 weight percent, less than about 4.25 weight percent, less than about 4 weight percent, less than about 3.75 weight percent, less than about 3.5 weight percent, less than about 3.25 weight percent, less than about 3 weight percent, less than about 2.75 weight percent, less than about 2.5 weight percent, less than about 2.25 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1.75 weight percent, less than about 1.5 weight percent, less than about 1.25 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the coffee composition and/or structure present. In one or more embodiments, the water content of the structured coffee composition may be described in reference to the water content of the ingredients used to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the ground roast coffee employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. In still other embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the combination of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee (i.e. the percent of water in the combined amount of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee) employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. For example, if a structured coffee composition is prepared with a ground roast coffee and an instant coffee that both have an initial water content of 3%, the structured coffee composition may have a water content with 15% of 3% (i.e., 2.55% to 3.45%). Coating Characteristics As indicated above, the coated coffee particles include a coating that compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extract(s) and extract(s) from the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the mean thickness of the coating, which may be measured using electron microscopy and/or micro computed tomography (Micro CT).

In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may include a coating with a mean thickness of about 5 microns to about 1500 microns, in other embodiments about 10 microns to about 1450 microns, in other embodiments about 20 microns to about 1400 microns, in other embodiments about 30 microns to about 1350 microns, in other embodiments about 40 microns to about 1300 microns, in other embodiments about 50 microns to about 1250 microns, in other embodiments about 60 microns to about 1200 microns, in other embodiments about 70 microns to about 1150 microns, in other embodiments about 80 microns to about 1100 microns, in other embodiments about 90 microns to about 1050 microns, in other embodiments about 100 microns to about 1000 microns, in other embodiments about 110 microns to about 950 microns, in other embodiments about 120 microns to about 900 microns, in other embodiments about 130 microns to about 850 microns, in other embodiments about 140 microns to about 800 microns, in other embodiments about 150 microns to about 750 microns, in other embodiments about 160 microns to about 700 microns, in other embodiments about 175 microns to about 600 microns, in other embodiments about 200 microns to about 550 microns, in other embodiments about 225 microns to about 500 microns, in other embodiments about 250 microns to about 450 microns, in other embodiments about 275 microns to about 400 microns, in other embodiments about 290 microns to about 350 microns, and in other embodiments about 300 microns to about 325 microns. In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the amount of the surface of the coffee particle that is coated by the coating that includes a mixture of the brewed coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the average surface area coverage of the coffee particle is in the range of about 50 percent to 100 percent, about 52.5 percent to 97.5 percent, or from about 55 percent to about 95 percent, or from about 57.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, or from about 60 percent to about 90 percent, or from about 62.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, or from about 65 percent to about 85 percent, or from about 67.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, or from about 70 percent to about 80 percent, or from about 72.5 percent to about 77.5 percent, or even about 75 percent of the exposed surface area of the coffee particle. Composition Size and Configuration: As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be used in structured coffee composition. Although the structured coffee compositions may be made in any size and/or three-dimensional geometric shape, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produce a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, an structured coffee may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and can optionally be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to break any coffee structure made from the one or more coffee compositions into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e., break a molded product/pellet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as one-half of a standard serving, or one-third of standard serving, or one-quarter of standard serving. The end user/consumer may add or reduce the number of coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference, to achieve brewed coffee that is weaker or stronger than normal. Since, in one embodiment, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; and 9,474,290, which disclose methods of adjusting the weakness or strength of a standard brewed coffee, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. Furthermore, about one (1) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about one (1) cup of coffee; or about three (3) standard servings of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or about four (4) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or even about five (5) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of dimensions, the process and ingredients the structured coffee composition may have a cylindrical structure measuring about 29 mm to about 33 mm in diameter and about 19.5 mm to about 32 mm in thickness and about 14.0 cm3 to about 27.0 cm3 in volume, which can have variations thereabout as further described below and shown in FIG. 2, and Tables 2, 3, and 4. The diameter and thickness can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 6.5 grams, about 7.5 grams, about 8.5 grams, about 10.5 grams, or even about 12.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 13 grams, about 15 grams, about 17 grams, about 21 grams, or even about 25 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 19.5 grams, about 22.5 grams, about 25.5 grams, about 31.5 grams, or even about 37.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 26 grams, about 30 grams, about 34 grams, about 42 grams, or even about 50 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. Similarly, structured coffee compositions made with different dose sizes, e.g., a coffee product made to produce one-third of a standard serving of brewed coffee per structure or molded product, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different structure configurations for the structured coffee composition are also possible. For example, cylinder, cube, cuboid, sphere, pellet, ellipsoid, triangular pyramid, hexagonal prism, truncated triangular pyramid, truncated square pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, truncated hexagonal pyramid, cone, truncated cone, diamond, a three dimensional shape with an oval-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with heart-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with triangle-shaped face, or pillow shape are contemplated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical molded structure can, if so desired, be concave or convex. Additionally, or alternatively, the outer surface of a structure or molded product can have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be in the form of a particulate or an agglomeration of particles. See FIG. 1 for examples of structural shapes. It should also be noted that comparative examples are shown in some tables and figures herein, which can be labeled “Tablet Example”. The comparative example, “Tablet Example”, is a coffee tablet made using a multi-step compaction process as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Resistance to Staling In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles may have a resistance to staling or a reduced perception of staling. Resistance to staling may be measured through the quantification of lipid oxidation byproducts, such as hexanal, that are known to be generated during coffee staling and contribute to the perception of stale coffee particulate or products. Reduced perception of staling in roasted coffee particulate or products by the end user (consumer) once brewed, can be measured though the use of a trained sensory panel calibrated to identify stale notes, such as “papery,” in a coffee brew. Advantageously, the coated coffee particles may protect coffee flavor from one or more negative organoleptic effects, such as development of paper off-notes, of staling, especially those staling effects caused by lipid oxidation. In one embodiment, this is accomplished via the use of a coated coffee particulate or product (i.e., roasted and ground coffee or coffee structures formed from a roasted and ground coffee particulate or product that has been coated in any manner discussed herein) which may limit exposure of such a coffee particulate or product to environmental conditions that cause or result in enhanced lipid oxidation. In addition, the structured coffee compositions may minimize surface area to volume ratios for coffee particulate or products that will be exposed to oxidative forces, further minimizing lipid oxidation and staling thereof. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 4 days in a UV light box. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and assessed by expert panelists for staling. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Further experimental details are included in the example section. The staling data may be reported along with the exposed surface area (i.e., the area of the surface that is exposed to light divided by the total volume of the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.5, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 1. Stated differently, the brewed coffee is perceived as not stale. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.82, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 2. Stated differently the brewed coffee is perceived to have a very slight off note. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by aging the coffee under UV lights and testing determining the hexanal content. The coffee may be aged by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 7 days. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and the amount of hexanal may be determined. Further experimental details are included in the example section. In one or more embodiments, the amount of hexanal after a week of exposure of light in the coated coffee particles may be less than 40 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 30 ng/g, other embodiments less than 25 ng/g, and in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g. Packaging and Use: The coated coffee particles are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages and/or packaging. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be provided in a package as a plurality of coated coffee particles. In other embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be bound together as a structured coffee composition. Due to the resistance to staling of the coated coffee particles, they allow for reduction of packaging materials and lowers packaging cost. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; woven and nonwoven filter paper, a nylon mesh material, boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. Moreover, the instant coated slurry and/or liquid coffee concentrate can even be used to coat the inside of a package or packaging material for the coffee compositions and/or coffee structures thereof. The packaging for the coated coffee particles may be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the coated coffee particles are periodically used by the consumer, the unused coated coffee particles that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. If desired, in embodiments where the coated coffee particles are used in structured coffee compositions, the structured coffee compositions may be packaged in any desired number so that each packaged amount can be designed to yield any desired number of brewed coffee servings and/or strengths. For example, structured coffee compositions are in one embodiment designed to produce a single serving of coffee per coffee composition and/or structures thereof can be packaged individually to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, in groups of two to facilitate making two cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of three to facilitate making three cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle and so forth up to groups of twelve to facilitate making twelve cups of coffee in a single brew. The structured coffee compositions may be packaged with more or less of the same to produce stronger or weaker coffee for a standard brew of coffee since, in one embodiment, the coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) can be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. Furthermore, in yet other embodiments designed to produce a single serving of coffee per structured coffee composition can be packaged individually as structured coffee composition to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, or can be packaged in a group of three (3) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of about four (4) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of even about five (5) structured coffee compositions coffee to facilitate making about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. One advantage is that two or more structured coffee compositions may be, via two different coffee compositions or structures formed from each respective different structured coffee composition, combined in the same brew to produce a preferred brew in which the one or more properties resulting from the combination of different coffee compositions or structures provide a desired variation, change or combination in flavor, strength, caffeine content, or other such characteristic in the preferred brew. A wide variety of types of structured coffee compositions can be provided together in a pre-packaged kit, or in a consumer selected array, to facilitate preparation of a preferred brew specific to an individual consumer's preferences. As such, an exemplary kit may include a plurality of varied structured coffee compositions, with at least two of the varied structured coffee compositions having a different predetermined property, such as, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, level of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee, or type, of coffee bean treatment. Such a kit can be provided with instructions for combining the two or more types of coffee composition to prepare a desired brewed coffee. These instructions may include one or more “recipes” for preparing one or more special predetermined blends of coffee. The present invention may be packaged as coffee compositions (if in loose powdered form) and/or as an appropriate number of structured coffee compositions. See various methods of packaging and use of coffee compositions and products as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition Properties: In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with brewing water of a desired and/or suitable temperature (any temperature could be used, for example in the range of 1° C. to 100° C., as both hot and cold coffee brews are desirable) at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated herein. The strength/robustness of the structured coffee compositions may conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a product's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the structure in an axial direction over the height of the structure or across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure. Product hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the structure is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the structure breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the structure to break is taken as the hardness of the structure, which is sometimes referred to as the “structure crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. As shown in Table 2 below and FIGS. 3A and 3B, the structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the height or axial direction of the structure in the range of about 21.3 N (Newtons) to about 61.7 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 20 N to about 65 N, about 22.5 N to about 62.5 N, about 25 N to about 60 N, about 27.5 N to about 57.5 N, about 30 N to about 55 N, about 32.5 N to about 52.5 N, about 35 N to about 50 N, about 37.5 N to about 47.5 N, about 40 N to about 45 N or even about 42.5 N. The structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure in the range of about 11.1 N (Newtons) to about 51.6 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 10 N to about 52.5 N, about 12.5 N to about 50 N, about 15 N to about 45 N, about 17.5 N to about 42.5 N, about 20 N to about 40 N, about 20 N to about 37.5 N, about 22.5 N to about 35 N, about 25 N to about 32.5 N, or even about 30 N.

For convenience, the friability of the structured coffee compositions can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating the structure in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these structures that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The structures should not be broken to obtain the weight of the structure in grams, but adjust the number of whole structures to come as close as possible to weight of the structure in grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of structures represents the friability of these structures. As shown in Table 3 below and in FIG. 4, it has been found that the structured coffee compositions, can have a friability in the range of about 50 to 55 percent to about 100 percent (total disintegration of the coffee structure), of about 57.5 percent to about 97.5 percent, of about 60 percent to about 95 percent, of about 62.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, of about 65 percent to about 90 percent, of about 67.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, of about 70 percent to about 85 percent, of about 72.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, of about 75 percent to about 80 percent, or even about 77.5 percent.

Water activity may be determined using a water activity meter such as a Rotronic Hygrolab Water Activity Meter. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. Furthermore, generally speaking, and as shown in Table 4 (water activity data) above, structured coffee compositions having the above combination of properties of about stated values and/or within claimed ranges for hardness, friability, and density within the diameter and height measurements and the about stated target weights may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. It has been further found that the coated coffee particles achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise conventional ground roast coffee composition. That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the coated coffee particles are used in a typical ADC coffee maker or other brewing devices than when the same amount of conventional ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. Yield ratios provided by the structured coffee compositions, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the structured coffee compositions relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of conventional ground roast coffee (e.g., the ground roast coffee used to prepare the structured coffee composition) is normally greater than about 1 and in many instances greater than about 1.1, greater than about 1.2, greater than about 1.25, greater than about 1.5, greater than about 1.75, greater than about 2, greater than about 2.25, greater, than about 2.5, greater than about 2.75, and even about 3 on a weight basis. As discussed herein, various particle sizes for the roast and ground coffee may be used, which may result in various percent brew solids, density, and percent porosity in the molded product. Porosity is measured by Micro-CT (also called microtomography or micro-computed tomography). In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity (i.e., percent of total volume) in the structured coffee compositions may greater than 40%, greater than 42.5%, greater than 45% or greater than 47.5%, or greater than 50%, or greater than 52.5%, or greater than 55%, or greater than 57.5%, or greater than 60%. In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity in the structured coffee compositions may range between from about 40% to about 80%, or from about 42.5% to about 77.5%, or from about 45% to about 75%, or from about 47.5% to about 72.5%, or from about 50% to about 70%, or from about 52.5% to about 67.5%, or from about 55% to about 65%, or from about 57.5% to about 62.5%, or even about 60%. In light of the above, when a standard serving of coffee is prepared the percent brew solids achieved by the structed coffee compositions are in the range of about 0.90 weight percent to about 3.00 weight percent, or from about 0.95 weight percent to about 2.95 weight percent, about 1.00 weight percent to about 2.9 weight percent, or from about 1.05 weight percent to about 2.85 weight percent, or from about 1.10 weight percent to about 2.80 weight percent, about 1.15 weight percent to about 2.75 weight percent, or from about 1.20 weight percent to about 2.70 weight percent, about 1.25 weight percent to about 2.65 weight percent, about 1.30 weight percent to about 2.60 weight percent, about 1.35 weight percent to about 2.55 weight percent, about 1.40 weight percent to about 2.50 weight percent, about 1.45 weight percent to about 2.45 weight percent, about 1.50 weight percent to about 2.40 weight percent, about 1.55 weight percent to about 2.35 weight percent, about 1.60 weight percent to about 2.30 weight percent, about 1.65 weight percent to about 2.25 weight percent, about 1.70 weight percent to about 2.20 weight percent, about 1.75 weight percent to about 2.15 weight percent, about 1.80 weight percent to about 2.10 weight percent, about 1.85 weight percent to about 2.05 weight percent, about 1.90 weight percent to about 2.00 weight percent, or even about 1.95 weight percent, based on the weight of the coffee brewed. For measurement of the percent (%) brew solids (%BS) used herein, the refractive index (RI) is measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. Then a linear regression equation is developed and used to correlate the RI to %BS. The coated coffee particles and structured coffee compositions prepared from the coated coffee particles coated coffee particles disassociate and brews rapidly in both room temperature and cold water applications when used for cold brew coffee, which is shown in Table 5. The present invention disassociates in hot water (196.5-202° F.) in about 15 to about 21 seconds, in room temperature water (72-72.3° F.) in about 1 minute 7 seconds to about 1 minute 24 seconds, and in cold water (38.7-42.3° F.) in about 2 minutes 51 seconds to about 4 minutes 12 seconds. While the coated coffee particles may be brewed by any conventional means, the coated coffee particles, when used for quick cold brew coffee provides a bold cold brew coffee strength to remain bold when served over ice. It uses less coffee and brews in a shorter time frame than conventional cold brew formulations to provide a consistent brew.

The follow list of coffee products are used to produce the various coffee brews tested by the panelists: (a) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at standard drop weight (30.5 grams) (FOL 30.5 grams); (b) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at drop weight matching the present invention composition drop weight (34.0 grams) (FOL 34 grams); (c) Present Invention (4×8.5 gram structures)−80 percent Folgers Classic Roast and Ground+20 percent Colcafe Instant (Invention); (d) Folgers Instant Crystals (14.2 grams) (Fol Inst); and (e) Colcafe Instant (14.2 grams)−Low Yield High Quality Instant (Colcafe). All products are brewed in Mr. Coffee ADC brewers in 1420 mL H2O at a temperature of about 157° F.+/−1° F. The panels are run blind and randomized. These products are evaluated and compared over a number of different coffee flavor attributes. It is determined that the coated coffee particles produce a brewed coffee that has the most coffee “Body,” such as heaviness, mouthfeel, consistency, and/or weight as it coated the tongue of the panelists. Further, Body, is the feeling of the consistency of the liquid related to the amount of extraction of the solids or any other additives that increase the viscosity (References: heaviness on tongue, fullness of mouthfeel). As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the coated coffee particle closely tracks the attributes of a conventional roast and ground coffee (both Folgers Classic roast and ground coffees) even with a mixture of instant coffee therein with the roast and ground. Working Examples: Proof of UV Treatment as an Accelerant to Induce Staling: A validation experiment is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of UV treatment to accelerate staling. This experiment evaluates the degree of difference (DOD) of brewed coffee flavor from a sealed control. The treatments include coffee placed on a foil lined tray subjected to UV aging, coffee placed on a foil lined tray and left in the dark, coffee left enclosed in its original canister after opening, and coffee left sealed in its original canister without opening. At the beginning of the experiment, ten cans of Folgers Classic Roast coffee are procured from a local grocery store (Buehler's, Orrville, Ohio). All cans are within their use by dates at time of evaluation. All cans are subjected to oxygen measurement before opening to ensure fresh coffee. Four randomly selected cans are opened and 29.5 gram lots of roast and ground coffee from each can are placed in a thin layer on two foil lined service trays (number of tray samples=8 trays total). Four of these trays are placed under UV lights, four are placed in dark in laboratory drawers. After coffee samples are distributed, the cans from which they came are then closed with their manufacture supplied lids and placed in a dark drawer at room temperature for storage. Finally, one tray of 29.5 grams of instant coffee (Folger's) is placed under UV light as well. Coffee samples are evaluated against a sealed reference at one, four and eleven days of storage. On the final day, the instant coffee is included in the evaluation. Degree of difference is scored internally by expert cuppers on the following scale: 0.2 no difference; 0.3 very slight difference; 0.5 slight difference; 0.8 moderate difference; and 1.2 large difference. Results: It is found that coffee stored under UV light is noticeably stale after one day of aging and is moderately to very different in flavor from a sealed control by day four. By day eleven, coffee stored under UV light and in the dark on trays are both moderately to very different from sealed controls and classified as stale (See Table 6 below). These results indicate that UV light treatment does accelerate the aging process. It also highlights that the sensory qualities produced by UV staling are the same as encountered in coffee samples that stale in the dark, supporting the theory that both UV exposed and non-UV exposed samples are undergoing similar aging reactions, but at different rates. Table 6 below discloses average degree of difference (DOD) scores for coffee stored under different conditions and illustrates that UV light rapidly accelerated the aging process.

The experiment examines four product forms all using an 80:20 weight percent mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee: (a) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee dry mix; (b) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed herein using water in the form of a three-dimensional coffee structure; (c) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed above using water in the form of a loose unformed particulate; and (d) flaked roast and ground coffee with instant in a dry mix. Evaluations are carried out using two different instant coffees, a high yield regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration and a high quality Colombian instant coffee from Coleafé. The experiment is set up as a randomized block design with five blocks containing three replicates of each of the four coffee forms disclosed above. At the start of the experiment, the first block is subjected to in initial evaluation before aging (Time (T)=0 days). After the initial assessment, the remaining blocks are placed under UV lights. Additional samples are evaluated at one, four and seven days. On sampling days, a block is chosen at random for evaluation. Coffee from the selected block is brewed (34 grams coffee to 1420 grams water) on an ADC brewer and subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using a trained sensory panel (no. of evaluators=9 to 11 evaluators per tasting). Panelists assign each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Before submitting coffee samples for sensory analysis, two 5.0 mL aliquots of each brew are collected for monitoring of chemical markers for lipid oxidation, including hexanal. Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Finally, samples from each treatment in each block are saved for imaging using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Results: It is found that there is a significant reduction in both staling flavor and the chemical marker for staling (hexanal) in the formed coffee structures of item (b) above versus all other treatments for both instant types (see FIGS. 9A and 9B). There is no difference between the un-formed three-dimensional coffee structures (item (c) above) and the roast and ground/instant mix control (Item (d) above). It is further determined that the exposed surface of the three-dimensional coffee structure of item (b) above has a significantly higher level of hexanal per gram dry coffee than the core of the structure (see FIG. 10). This suggests a surface area effect for protecting the coffee from staling. It is found that a coating of instant coffee is formed on individual roast and ground coffee particles during the methods of the present invention using water as described herein. However, it is also found that the coating of the roast and ground coffee particles is uneven, leaving some areas with no instant coffee coating (see FIGS. 11A, 11B and 11C). Specifically, FIG. 9A illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above are scored significantly lower compared to all other forms of coffee (items (a), (c) and (d)) for papery notes, a measure of coffee staling, for both instant coffee types. FIG. 9B illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above have significantly lower hexanal concentrations as compared to all other treatments (items (a), (c) and (d)) starting at day three of the experiment for both instant coffees evaluated. FIG. 10 illustrates that the surface of the three-dimensional coffee structures have a significantly higher concentration of hexanal than the core of the coffee structures as evidenced by higher hexanal/deuterated hexanal ratio for the surface of the coffee structures (see item (b) above). This difference is identified in the coffee structures of item (b) using both instant coffee types. FIGS. 11A, 11B and 11C are electron micrographs of un-treated roast and ground coffee particles where FIG. 11A depicts void spaces with sharp edges resulting from the remnants of cell walls of the coffee seed; FIG. 11B depicts that some portions of the un-coated coffee particulate particles are similarly un-coated; and FIG. 11C depicts that other portions exhibit an instant coffee coating. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: To test the barrier effects of an instant coffee coating apart from the effect of product form, this experiment places roast and ground coffee into metal tins that are then subjected to accelerated aging using UV light. The tins protect the coffee from light except at the exposed surface. The tins are then assigned to one of four treatments: (i) uncovered with full exposure to UV light; (ii) covered with a metal tin lid; (iii) partially covered with instant coffee coating; and (iv) fully covered with an instant coffee coating. The tins are exposed to UV light for five days and then subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation by expert cuppers and evaluated for stale flavors. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Results: After five (5) days of aging, it is found that coffee covered with a full coating of instant coffee is not significantly different from coffee covered with a tin lid, thus showing no staling effect for both treatments. Coffee exposed to UV light, or with a partial coating, tastes stale. Matching the sensory results, the level of hexanal in the uncovered samples is significantly higher than in the control or fully coated samples, indicating that the fully coated samples are protected from staling. As shown in FIG. 12, the hexanal to deuterated hexanal ratio of samples covered with a tin lid (control) or covered with a full coating of instant coffee (covered) are significantly lower than uncovered samples, indicating that less staling had occurred. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: This experiment is designed to test if thin layers of instant coffee could prevent staling of roast and ground coffee. In this experiment, thin layers if instant coffee (covering two ranges of thickness, averaging 45 μm and 258 μm, respectively) are created on a scaffolding of nylon mesh. Layers are created by applying hydrated instant coffee (1:1 w/w with water) to the mesh with a brush. The scaffold is then allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight. The resulting layers of instant coffee are then fixed over trays of roast and ground coffee. Trays are then subjected accelerated aging using UV light. Staling is assessed through sensory evaluation and measurement of chemical staling markers. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using expert cuppers. Cuppers assigned each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. The instant coffee films are visualized and their thickness measured using ESEM (150× magnification). Thin films averaged 48 μm in thickness (minimum 23 μm), while the thicker films averaged 258 μm in thickness. A nylon mesh is used as a scaffolding to form thin layers of instant coffee. To test the effectiveness of these layers in preventing staling, the mesh scaffolds with and without instant coffee are placed over trays of roast and ground coffee during accelerated aging using UV light. Results: It is found that the instant coffee films (both thicknesses) are able to reduce staling in the roast and ground coffee as assessed though sensory evaluation and measurement of the chemical staling marker hexanal (see FIGS. 13A and 13B, respectively). This experiment demonstrates that a thin film of instant coffee is able to confer a protective effect against staling for roast and ground coffee. As illustrated in FIG. 13A, papery flavor scores for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. As illustrated in FIG. 13B, the area ratios between hexanal and deuterated hexanal for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. Creating Roast and Ground Particles with Instant Coating: This set of experiments evaluates several different methods of combining at least one roast and ground coffee with a hydrated slurry formed from water and at least one instant coffee (or equivalent) for their ability to form an instant coffee coating on the at least one type of roast and ground coffee (see Table 7 for the various particulars). Coating completeness is evaluated by electron microscopy. The method of forming the coated products of Treatments 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 is discussed in detail below. Each form represents a different means of application that is effective in producing a coating with a coverage within the scope of the present invention as discussed above. As shown in Table 7, different treatments are tested to see if a coating of instant coffee within the scope of the present invention as detailed herein could be applied to roast and ground coffee particles.

Treatment 2—Roast and Ground Coffee with Liquid Coffee Concentrate, small agglomerates: Step (1): Place liquid coffee concentrate (20.0g liquid coffee concentrate for 100 grams of mix) in a clean stand mixer bowl. Agitate the coffee concentrate at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment (about 0.5 minutes) Step (2): Once the liquid coffee concentrate has begun to coat the mixing bowl, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the liquid coffee concentrate at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts liquid coffee concentrate (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams liquid coffee concentrate). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the liquid coffee concentrate suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and liquid coffee concentrate are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #8 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen. The resulting matrix is then transferred to a drying surface (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). Step (5): The resulting matrix is allowed to dry over night or until excess moisture is removed. Treatment 4—Particulate Air Dried: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) of at least one type of instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until fully mixed (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allowed dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 6—Particulate #16 Sieve: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #16 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen in order to create small agglomerates/particles over a catch tray that can be used for drying (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). The screening process creates small agglomerates that dry easily at room temperature. Step (5): The resulting mixture is allowed to dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 8—Particulate: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 60 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 60.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 10—Microgrind: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (50.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (50.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula with gentle agitation. Allow the resulting coffee-water mixture to settle for about 30 minutes. Remove any foam from the top of the instant coffee suspension and retain the de-foamed suspension. Step (2): Combine the de-foamed instant coffee suspension with microgrind roast and ground coffee in a stand mixer bowl at a ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts dry instant coffee equivalent (80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 40.0 grams of instant coffee suspension from Step (1)). Mix microgrind roast and ground coffee and instant coffee suspension using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (3): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Results: The above experiments found that by varying one of several variables, a desired shell formed from one or more types of liquid coffee concentrate or instant coffee, with any desired coverage percentage as disclosed above, could be achieved around individual roast and ground coffee particles (see FIGS. 14A through 14E) as evidenced by comparison to uncoated regions of a un-formed coffee particulate coffee ground (see FIG. 15). Variables within the scope of the present invention include, but are not limited to, increasing the amount of water in the water/instant coffee mixture, varying the roast and ground particle size, increasing the amount of instant coffee slurry to roast and ground coffee to form the instant coffee/roast and ground mixture, and/or altering the post-mix handling process. More Anti-Staling Working Examples: Multiple experiments to test anti-staling properties of coffee extract coatings are setup and run to analyze the impact of the following: (i) surface area to volume ratio; (ii) instant coffee mass to water ratio; and (iii) use of liquid coffee extract as a coating substance. Accelerated aging using UV light box is utilized for three to four days of aging. Staling of the coffee samples is assessed by expert panelists through independent assessments. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Impact of Surface Area to Volume Ratio on Staling of Coffee: Two sample types of coffee are prepared to assess the impact of surface area to volume ratio on coffee samples which include (1) loose roast and ground coffee on a tray; and (2) three-dimensional coffee structures prepared from the any one of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein. For item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee the percent of surface area exposed to UV light is controlled with aluminum foil (Al) or sheets of instant coffee film (IF) laid over the roast and ground coffee. The coffee on an uncovered tray has one (top) surface exposed to UV (50 percent of surface area) and one (bottom) surface against the tray bottom (50 percent of surface area). For item (2) the three-dimensional coffee structure (cylindrical shaped) only the top surface of the structure is directly exposed to UV light. Decreasing the mass of the structure changes its height, but does not change its diameter. Further, decreasing the mass of the structure increases the surface area exposed to UV light for a given mass of structures (approximately 34 grams). Both coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: Item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee on a tray started to stale between 75 percent and 85 percent coverage. The instant coffee film (IF) covered coffee samples performed as well as the aluminum foil (Al) covered coffee samples. The three dimensional structures of the present invention discussed herein started to stale between tablets weights of about four gram to two gram target weights. As seen in Table 8, staling of coffee samples discussed above is not detected at a surface to area volume ratio at or below 0.82. Staling is detected at a surface area to volume ratio at or above 1.39. Exposed surface area to volume ratios for preventing staling of any of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein are at least about 0, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.05, at least about 0.07, at least about 0.10, at least about 0.12, at least about 0.15, at least about 0.17, at least about 0.20, at least about 0.22, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.27, at least about 0.30, at least about 0.32, at least about 0.35, at least about 0.37, at least about 0.40, at least about 0.43 at least about 0.45, at least about 0.48, at least about 0.50, at least about 0.53, at least about 0.55, at least about 0.57, at least about 0.60, at least about 0.62, at least about 0.65, at least about 0.67, at least about 0.70, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.75, at least about 0.77, at least about 0.80, at least about 0.82, at least about 0.84, at least about 0.86, at least about 0.88, at least about 0.90, at least about 0.92, at least about 0.94, at least about 0.96, at least about 0.98, or even at least about 1. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges.

The instant coffee dilutions of items (i) through (iii) above are tested on micro grind roast and ground coffee (particle size of about 200 microns or less) and ADC brewer grind size roast and ground coffee (average particle size of about 1000 microns). All treatments of items (i) through (iii) are applied using various methods as discussed herein of the present invention at an 80:20 mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee to make coffee compositions of the present invention as discussed herein. The coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the microgrind coffee samples with a more diluted suspension of instant coffee (1:4) to water is more effective at protecting the microgrind coffee from staling than more concentrated suspensions (1:1 or 1:2), which is likely due to increased coating with less dense extract suspension on this grind size. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of three (3) (slightly stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of one (1) (not stale) For ADC brewer grind size, the larger grind size, a more concentrated suspension of instant coffee in water is more effective at protecting the coffee from staling. The larger grind size may absorb the suspension differently than smaller particles. Grind size is critical to determine the target instant coffee dilution (weight percent) for forming the coating. It is determined that different dilutions needed at different grind sizes. For the microgrind a 1:4 dilution is targeted and for the ADC brewer grind size, a 1:1-1:2 dilution is targeted. For the ADC brewer grind size, the negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). Impact of Roast and Ground Coffee to Coffee Extract Ratio on Staling: Three ratios of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract are analyzed including: (i) 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; (ii) 70:30 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; and (iii) 60:40 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract (all at a weight to weight). Two roast and ground grind sizes of coffee are analyzed for the coating of instant coffee thereof including microgrind and ADC brewer grind size. Liquid coffee concentrate is used to coat the roast and ground coffee. All roast and ground coffee samples are in particulate form. The coated coffee samples are aged under UV light for three days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the liquid coffee concentrate coating on microgrind coffee, an increased amount of liquid coffee (60:40 ratio) in the formulation helps prevent staling versus less mass of liquid coffee (80:20 or 70:30 ratios). The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is more effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 60:40 ratio received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of three point five (3.5) (slightly stale to stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). For liquid coffee concentrate coating on ADC brewer grind size, an increased amount of liquid coffee (70:30 ratio) staled while application of liquid coffee 20 percent by weight did not. The 60:40 application is too liquid to form particulates and is untestable. The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is less effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of the five (5) (very stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of one (1) (not stale). Summary of Anti-Staling Working Examples: The total solids concentration and liquid volume impact the instant coating effectiveness of protecting the roast and ground coffee from staling. Target application of the instant coating on microgrind coffee is an instant coffee dilution of 1:4 instant coffee to water and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for microgrind coffee is a target applied at 60:40 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight). Target application for ADC brewer grind size coffee for instant coffee dilution is about a 1:1 to about a 1:2 instant coffee to water ratio and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for ADC brewer grind size coffee is target applied at 80:20 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight).

No. 10/272,968, filed Oct. 17, 2002, now abandoned which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/345,234, filed Oct. 19, 2001, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to liquid coffee concentrates, methods of producing and assessing the quality of liquid coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Consumers produce the traditional “pot of coffee” by extracting the desired components of roast and ground coffee using an automatic drip coffee maker (ADC) or other form of brewer. Although the flavor and aroma of such a coffee beverage is highly desired and appreciated, the inconvenience of the brewing process has lead to the development of instant coffee and coffee concentrate products that allow the consumer to quickly make a single cup of coffee. Unfortunately, the production processes used to produce such coffee products result in finished products having ratios of flavor and aroma components that are different from fresh brewed coffee. As a result, coffee beverages produced from such concentrated products do not have the highly desired flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee. Since the flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee is especially desired by consumers, attempts have been made to improve the flavor and aroma of products made from coffee concentrates. Such attempts include incorporating volatile aroma flavor components into the finished concentrates, and the intensification of such components by the application of thermal energy. While such attempts are appreciated, there remains a need for a liquid coffee concentrate having the same ratios of flavor and aroma components as that of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the coffee concentrate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicant's invention relates to a liquid coffee concentrate having a furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value that is from about 50% to about 210% of the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Applicants also claim methods of producing and assessing the quality of coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. DETAILED DESCRIPTION A. Definitions As used herein, the term “coffee product” includes, but is not limited to coffee concentrates, coffee extracts and fresh brewed coffee. As used herein, the term “coffee concentrate” means a coffee extract that has undergone additional processing, such as thermal treatment. As used herein, the term “pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's pyridine and 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting pyridine's peak area value is divided by said 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran's peak area value. As used herein, the term “furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's furfuryl acetate and 4-ethyl guaiacol peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting furfuryl acetate's peak area value is divided by said 4-ethyl guaiacol's peak area value. As used herein, the term “unit operation” includes, but is not limited to, equipment used to transfer heat such as heaters and coolers; holders; and transfer lines. All percentages and ratios are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, the articles a and an, when used in a claim, are understood to mean at least one of the components that are claimed or described. Publications, patents, and patent applications are referred to throughout this disclosure. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. B. Coffee Concentrate Characteristics and Preparation The quality of any ready-to-use coffee product, made from a coffee concentrate, is dependent on the properties of the concentrate. Although coffee concentrates contain innumerable aroma and flavor components, Applicants discovered that the flavor and aroma of products made from concentrate approaches that of fresh brewed coffee when the concentrate's ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol approaches the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the concentrate. In addition to discovering the correlation between the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol, and flavor and aroma, Applicants discovered that a coffee concentrate's ratio of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol can be adjusted by the application of thermal energy to the concentrate. While evaluating the suitability of thermal processing, Applicants discovered that the entire, rather than just the hold tube portion, of a time and temperature profile must be considered. Applicants also recognized that the suitability of any set of thermal processing conditions is not only time and magnitude dependent but rate dependent as well. As a result, more common thermal processing descriptors such as Fo are insufficient to describe the thermal processing conditions that will result in the flavor and aroma improvements of Applicants' invention. Thus, Applicants' processing conditions are described in terms of equivalent times and temperatures, as thermal processing conditions that are time, magnitude and rate dependent can be effectively and efficiently described by these descriptors. A detailed description of Applicants' coffee concentrate and processes of making said concentrate is set forth in detail below. 1. Coffee Concentrate Embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 50% to about 210% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 65% to about 150% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Still other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 80% to about 120% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. 2. Process of Making Coffee Concentrate Coffee extracts that can be thermally processed according to Applicants' process can be prepared by any suitable process used to produce a coffee extract. Preferably, said coffee extracts are non-hydrolysed liquids having pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio values of from about 3:1 to about 25:1 and solids contents of from about 2.3% to about 25% by weight. Other preferred non-hydrolysed liquid coffee extracts include those extracts having a pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value of from about 4:1 to about 20:1 and a solids content of from about 3.5% to about 10% by weight; and those extracts having a pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value of from about 4.5:1 to about 15:1 and a solids content of from about 3.5% to about 8% by weight. Suitable methods of producing a coffee extract include, but are not limited to, extracting said concentrate from roasted and ground, caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee using a continuous flow column. Said columns are typically stainless steel vertical columns having a height-to-diameter ratio greater than or equal to 6:1 and a perforated top and bottom retainer to permit the transport of feed water while simultaneously keeping coffee granules between the retainers. Suitable columns can be obtained from Niro A/S of Soeborg, Denmark. Suitable extraction conditions include, but are not limited to, operating the extraction process at a temperature less than 149° C. and achieving a flow rate ratio of kilograms water per minute to kilograms of coffee from about 0.1:1 to about 0.5:1, a water front speed of from about 5 cm to about 25 cm per minute, a draw-off ratio of mass of extract to mass of coffee from about 4:1 to about 10:1; and a yield of from about 17% to about 35%. Other suitable extraction conditions include operating the extraction process at a temperature less than 149° C. and achieving a flow rate ratio of kilograms water per minute to kilograms of coffee from about 0.2:1 to about 0.4:1, a water front speed of from about 12.5 cm to about 25 cm per minute, a draw-off ratio of mass of extract to mass of coffee from about 5.5:1 to about 8:1; and a yield of from about 17% to about 30%; and operating the extraction process at a temperature less than 149° C. and achieving a flow rate ratio of kilograms water per minute to kilograms of coffee from about 0.25:1 to about 0.36:1, a water front speed of from about 12.5 cm to about 15.2 cm per minute, a draw-off ratio of mass of extract to mass of coffee from about 6.5:1 to about 7:1; and a yield of from about 23% to about 27.5%. Still other suitable extraction conditions include operating the extraction process at a temperature range of from about 65° C. to about 99° C. or from about 82° C. to about 93° C. and achieving any set of flow rate, water front speed, draw-off ratio and yield parameters detailed previously. After a suitable extract is obtained, said extract is thermally processed. Suitable thermal processing equipment includes but is not limited to, a MicroThermics model 25DH UHT/HTST unit. Said equipment can be obtained from MicroThermics Inc. Raleigh, N.C. U.S.A. Regardless of the thermal processing equipment that is employed to thermally process a coffee extract, said equipment must be operated such that the extract is heat treated for an equivalent time from about 15 seconds to about 35 seconds at an equivalent temperature of from about 115° C. to about 149° C.; preferably said equipment must be operated such that the extract is heat treated for an equivalent time from about 16.5 seconds to about 30 seconds at an equivalent temperature of from about 126° C. to about 149° C.; and most preferably said equipment must be operated such that the extract is heat treated for an equivalent time from about 18 seconds to about 28 seconds at an equivalent temperature of from about 137° C. to about 149° C. Additionally, when an extract is heat treated for an equivalent time and temperature combination such that the following mathematical relationship is true, the resulting concentrate is sufficiently sterile to be aseptically packaged. Log ⁢ ⁢ ( Equivalent ⁢ ⁢ Time ) ≥ log ⁡ ( 10.1 ) - ( Equivalent ⁢ ⁢ Temperature - 135 ⁢ ° ⁢ ⁢ C . ) 10.5 The resultant coffee concentrate used may be used immediately, in the same manner as conventional coffee concentrates, to form coffee containing products or may be packaged according to known methods for later use.

The complete text of these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to structured coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be used in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers can find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. Single serving coffee makers such as those by Hamilton Beach, Cuisinart, Mr. Coffee and others are generally designed to make a single cup of coffee (but can make slightly larger volumes) using a single use ground, or powered, coffee composition. In some instances, the coffee compositions used in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be powered in nature, in other instances the coffee compositions utilized in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be contained in what is typically viewed as a single use coffee “cup.” In this instance, such a coffee “cup” container/structure can contain, but does not require, a built-in filter element that lines the inside surface of such a single “use” coffee cup container/structure. It should be noted that although such coffee cup containers/structures are viewed as single use, the end user or consumer can, and often does, use such single use coffee cups more than once. Other forms of coffee makers and methods for preparing coffee include, but are not limited to, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced whereby various manufacturers provide coffee in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, are provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “containers,” “cups,” and/or “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are really only designed to brew a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tabletted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. In light of the above and in view of the current products available in the marketplace, it would be desirable to develop a coffee composition and one or more items made therefrom that utilize a combination of instant coffee with one or more of roast coffee and/or ground coffee to achieve a coffee composition able to achieve a variety of brew amounts while still maintaining the product's integrity in combination with providing faster disassociation when brewed, thereby advantageously providing a variety of consistent coffee products of varying strengths. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided are structured coffee compositions and to various items made using such structured coffee compositions. In one embodiment, the structured coffee compositions may be used in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a structured coffee composition comprising: a plurality of ground roast coffee particles that each include an outer surface; and a coating of one or more coffee extracts and one or more extracts from the roast and ground coffee particles on the outer surface of the ground roast coffee particles, wherein the one or more coffee extracts binds the plurality of roast and ground coffee particles together to form a structure with porosity that is greater than 40%; and wherein a weight percent of the ground roast coffee particles is in the range of about 65 wt % to about 90 wt % based on the total weight of the roast and ground coffee particles and the one or more coffee extracts, and a weight percent of the one or more coffee extracts is in the range of about 10 wt % to about 35 wt % based on the total weight of roast and the ground coffee particles and the one or more coffee extracts. . The structured coffee composition may take the form of a cylinder, cube, cuboid, sphere, pellet, ellipsoid, triangular pyramid, hexagonal prism, truncated triangular pyramid, truncated square pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, truncated hexagonal pyramid, cone, truncated cone, diamond, a three dimensional shape with an oval-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with heart-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with triangle-shaped face, or pillow. In another embodiment, the present invention relates a method of making a structured coffee composition comprising the steps of: (A) supplying a solution of one or more coffee extracts that includes coffee solids; (B) mixing the one or more ground roast coffees and the solution of one or more coffee extracts until a granulated composition is formed; (C) forming a structure from the granulated composition; and (D) drying the granulated composition to achieve a moisture content of less than 10 wt % based on the total weight of the structured coffee composition and a porosity that is greater than 40%.; wherein a weight percent of the one or more roasted ground coffees is in the range of about 60 wt % to about 90 wt % based on of the total weight of the one or more roast and ground coffees and the coffee solids in the one or more coffee extracts, and a weight percent of the coffee solids in the one or more coffee extracts is in the range of about 10 wt % to about 40 wt % based on of the total weight of one or more roast and ground coffee particles and the coffee solids of the one or more coffee extracts..

Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the numerical properties set forth in the following specification and claims are approximations that can vary depending on the desired properties sought to be obtained in embodiments of the present invention. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations; the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported with relative precision. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from error found in their respective measurements. As noted above, the present invention relates to structured coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to coffee compositions suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. Terminology: Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Non-Coffee Binder” means a material which improves the structural integrity of a coffee composition made in accordance with the present invention. “Non-Coffee Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc., or any one or more binders made from one or more coffee ingredients and some amount of water. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, liquid coffee concentrate, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. Ground roast coffee can also be referred to as “roast coffee, ground coffee, or even a combination of roast coffee and ground coffee”. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Coffee solids” means the coffee constituents that are extracted or extractable during the brewing of coffee. Unless indicated otherwise, the term coffee solids refers to both the dissolved coffee solids and suspended coffee solids (e.g., very small grinds or fines). “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee composition means that the coffee composition is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the composition, when the composition is in place in a brewing device so as to be contacted with water (hot, cold or any temperature therebetween) for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example, flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3 weight percent) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. Furthermore, instant coffee used in the present invention can be prepared by any convenient process, of which a variety of processes are known to those skilled in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Moreover, representative spray drying processes that can provide suitable instant coffee are disclosed in, for example, pages 382 through 513 of Sivetz & Foote, “Coffee Processing Technology,” Vol. I (Avi Publishing Co. 1963), U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,771,343, 2,750,998, and 2,469,553, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Other suitable processes for providing instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,436,227, 3,493,388, 3,615,669, 3,620,756, and 3,652,293, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. The instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention can be prepared form any single variety of coffees or a blend of different varieties, and can be decaffeinated or un-decaffeinated, and can be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic as necessary. Additionally, instant coffee has many forms: spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid. “Liquid coffee concentrate” or “liquid coffee extract” as used herein designates an aqueous extract of the roasted coffee beans wherein the solids content is substantially greater than used for direct consumption as a beverage. The coffee solids content may be from about 10 wt % to about 75 wt %. The term as used here indicates a concentrated coffee extract, irrespective of this being liquid or a solid deep frozen coffee concentrate. As is generally known coffee extracts are recovered by contacting roasted and ground coffee beans with water or an aqueous solution. On an industrial scale, the intention is to achieve high extraction efficiency leading to extraction of aroma substances, that is odorants and flavorings, from the ground coffee. The concentration method is not particularly limited and can be performed by a known method and apparatus, evaporation, membrane concentration, concentration under reduced pressure, freeze concentration, and the like. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3 grams to about 5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of espresso strength brewed coffee. In one embodiment, the present invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures can be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing can include about 70° C. to about 100° C., about 80° C. to about 99° C., about 85° C. to about 97° C., or about 90° C. to about 96° C. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce anywhere from about 4 to about 12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The coffee products of the present invention can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and can be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. For more information related to ADC brewers see, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition The general inventive concepts encompass various embodiments that are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include ground roast coffee that is bound together with coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. Examples of coffee extracts for use in the solution of coffee extract include, but are not limited to liquid coffee concentrate and instant coffee. Advantageously, the coffee extracts assist in coating and binding the particles of the ground roast coffee together. The structured coffee composition may have a random three-dimensional shape such as an agglomerate or a geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. It has been found that by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure a plurality of ground roast coffee particles in a matrix of coffee extract may be prepared. Through the mixing of the solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee, a portion of the ground roasted coffee is extracted. Accordingly, the resultant matrix on the ground roast coffee particles includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. Stated differently, the coffee extract matrix is composed of compounds that originated from both the coffee exact and roast and ground coffee particles. In one or more embodiments, coffee exact may be prepared from an instant coffee, a liquid coffee concentrate, or a combination thereof. The coffee extract and ground roast coffee extract matrix may simply be referred to as the matrix. In one or more embodiments, where the matrix at least partially surrounds a ground roast coffee particle, the matrix may be referred to as a coating. For the purpose of this specification, ground roast coffee particles that include a coating of the matrix or coffee extract and extract from the round roast coffee may be referred to as the coated ground roast coffee particles. The coating at least partially covers the surface of the ground roast coffee particles and may fill in any cracks or crevices on the surface of the particle. The coating of the ground roast coffee particles may also bind the particles together to form a structured coffee composition. As indicated above, the matrix or coating of the ground roast coffee particles compositionally includes mixture of the coffee extract(s) and extract(s) from the ground roast coffee. This mixture may be experimentally shown via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR analysis shows a peak that corresponds with a wavelength of 940 nm in the coffee coating that is not present in coffee extracts such as those prepared from instant coffee. This peak is high in ground roasted coffee but is present in lower amounts in the coating. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the peak may be related to lipids present in the ground roast coffee, but it may also be a combination of lipids with other compounds that absorb in this region. Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/QTOF) analysis of the coffee coating and ground roast coffee particles, and the coffee extracts may also be used to show compositional differences. For example, coffee extracts such as instant coffee have an extremely low amount of lipids and a different compositional background compared to roast and ground coffee. The presence of high amounts of lipids and/or composition similar to roast and ground coffee but different from instant would indicate a solvent was used. Further, visual appearance of the coating through by surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy or other surface measuring techniques may be used to identify that the coating of coffee extracts was added using a solvent. Visual appearance may also suggest that a solvent was used. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of problems solved, the structured coffee composition advantageously provides a solution to one or more of the following problems: (a) fast disassociation in hot or cold water; (b) the creation of a larger surface area via capillary action creating void spaces due to solution of the instant component; (c) significantly higher percentages brew solids (BS) are achieved with less coffee weight and volume; (d) delivery of improved brew profile and rich color early in brew; (e) consistent results across a full range of brew methods (i.e., ADC, single serve, French Press, cup infuser, cold brew); (f) the structured coffee composition may be prepared with 100 percent coffee or coffee related flavorings/additives; (g) coffee flavor of instant coffee portion of the composition is enhanced by extraction of flavor notes from ground roast component; (h) cold brewing can be achieved with significantly less volumes of coffee and shorter brew times (e.g., four 8.5 gram structured coffee compositions may extract in 1700 milliliters of cold water at about 38.7 to about 42.3° F. in about 2 to about 4 hours or about 2 to about 3 hours for cold brew coffee with a percent brew solids of about 1.0 to about 1.5.); and (i) the product stays fresher longer (less staling perception) when stored in low barrier packaging. Ingredients: Ground Roast Coffee As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may be prepared from ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “Arabica(s)”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “Robusta(s)”). See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in its entirety. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of ground coffees produced from the coffee beans discussed above can be used to make the structured coffee composition. Further, mixtures of two or more different varieties, or types, of ground coffees described above can also be used in combination to prepare the structured coffee composition. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12 weight percent. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology, “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112 to 169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. In other embodiments, the coffee been may be “pre-dried” prior to roasting. In these or other embodiments, the coffee beans may be dried to a moisture content in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Exemplary methods of pre-drying a coffee bean are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,160,757 and 5,322,703 and which are both incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. This drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional or low moisture drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at a temperature in the range of about 70° F. to about 325° F. (21° C. to 163° C.), or from about 90° F. to about 300° F., or from about 120° F. to about 275° F., or even from about 160° F. to about 250° F. over drying times lasting about 1 minute to about 24 hours, or from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, or from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, or from about 3 hours to about 6 hours, or even from about 4 hours to about 5 hours. After drying the green coffee beans (and optionally pre-drying the coffee beans), the coffee beans to are typically processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of the present invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans can be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8° C. to about 371.1° C. (about 350° F. to about 700° F.), or about 176.8° C. to about 260° C. (about 350° F. to about 500° F.), or about 204.4° C. to about 232.2° C. (about 400° C. to about 450° F.), or about 260° C. to about 287.8° C. (about 500° C. to about 550° F.), or about 315.6° C. to about 348.9° C. (about 600° C. to about 660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and can, for example, be about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or about 12 minutes to about 18 minutes, or can be about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 6 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 4 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and can, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1 minutes to about 3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° F. to about 1200° F. (about 177 C to about 649° C.), or from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, or from about 10 seconds to about 47 seconds. As is well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee that is used to make the structured coffee composition can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, or from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, or even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as about 250 μm (microns) and as high as about 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of about 400 μm to about 2,500 μm, or from about 500 μm to about 2,400 μm, or from about 650 μm to about 2,200 μm, or from about 800 μm to about 2,000 μm, or from about 900 μm to about 1,800 μm, or from about 1,000 μm to about 1,600 μm, or from about 1,200 μm to about 1,400 μm, or even about 1,300 μm. The coffee beans can be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to about 1.5 mm, or from about 300 μm to about 1,600 μm, or even from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles can be broken down during three-dimensional shape molding, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the molded structure formed from the various coffee compositions described herein. In one or embodiments, the size of the ground roast coffee particles may be described with reference to the size range of the coffee typically employed for a particular brewing method. In one or more embodiments, the ground roast coffee particles may be a coarse grind typically used for French press or percolator coffee brew, for example (e.g., about 900 microns to about 1400 microns), a medium-coarse grind typically used for pour over brewers, flat bottom drip brewer or ADC, or Aeropress, for example, (e.g., about 800 microns to about 1200 microns), a medium grind typically used for clever dripper, café solo, or single serve brewer, for example, (e.g., about 500 microns to about 900 microns), a medium fine grind typically used for Turkish coffee, for example, (e.g., about 200 microns to about 550 microns) or a super fine grind typically used for espresso, or moka pot, for example (e.g., about 200 microns to about 450 microns), or any one or more combinations thereof based on the desired type of coffee beverage and coffee strength. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by full particle size distribution curve. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than about 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. In one or more embodiment the roast ground coffee particles may be prepared using mill flaking. Mill flaking technology or mill flaking is a unique grinding process that creates a larger surface area on each flake for hot water to easily extract more of our coffee flavor. Flaked coffee is further disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,676, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/mL to about 0.35 g/mL such as, for example, about 0.263 g/mL, about 0.288 g/mL, about 0.325 g/mL, or even about 0.35 g/mL, if desired. Alternatively, the structured coffee composition can also be made for ground roast coffees having lower or higher densities, if desired. For example, the structured coffee compositions can be made from high density coffees having densities of greater than about 0.40 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of up to about 0.60 g/cm 3 , although even higher densities are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. Similarly, the structured coffee composition can be made from low density coffees having densities of less than about 0.18 g/mL to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 to about 0.25 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.22 g/cm 3 to about 0.23 g/cm 3 (such as about 0.19 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 , about 0.21 g/cm 3 , about 0.22 g/cm 3 , about 0.23 g/cm 3 , about 0.24 g/cm 3 or even about 0.25 g/cm 3 ). Furthermore, the structured coffee composition can be made from higher density coffees having densities from about 0.39 g/cc to about 0.57 g/cc, or from about 0.40 g/cc to about 0.56 g/cc, or from about 0.46 g/cc to about 0.48 g/cc, or even about 0.47 g/cc. In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3.5 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.75 to about 4.25 weight percent. In one instance, the inventive coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.6 weight percent, or from about 2.85 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or even from about 4.5 weight percent to about 4.85 weight percent. Generally speaking, the structured coffee composition can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, in one embodiment it is desirable that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular,” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. In another instance, embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the coffee compositions of the present invention is/are decaffeinated are also within the scope of the present invention. In one or more embodiments, the amount of one or more ground roast coffees (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the structured coffee composition used are in the range of about 65 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, or from about 67.5 weight percent to about 87.5 weight percent, or from about 70 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, or from about 72.5 weight percent to about 82.5 weight percent, or from about 75 weight percent to about 80 weight percent even about 77.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Instant Coffee As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may include instant coffee. The instant coffee may be used to form a slurry in the preparation of the structured coffee composition by adding water to an instant coffee. The slurry is then combined with roast and ground coffee. It has been found that when an instant coffee is included in the structured coffee composition, the instant coffee may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. The presence of instant coffee in coffee compositions and/or structures can be detected by a number of different methods. However, one method is described in R.M. Noyes and C.M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee product to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. See various methods of detecting presence of instant coffee also as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different instant coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the method of which the instant coffee is prepared and other factors. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of less than 7 weight percent, or less than 6.5 weight percent, or less than 6 weight percent, or of less than 5.5 weight percent, or of less than 5 weight percent, or less than 4.5 weight percent, or of less than 4 weight percent, or less than 3.5 weight percent, or of less than 3 weight percent. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of about 0.5 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.5 to about 4.25 weight percent. Suitable instant coffee for use in the structured coffee composition include, but are not limited to, spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid instant coffees. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the yield of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high yield instant coffee, a medium yield instant coffee, or a low yield instant coffee. High yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of greater than 45%. High yields instant coffees may be obtained using a primary and then a secondary extract with high water temperatures. Typically, high yield instant coffees include a high robusta content to maximize extraction yield. Medium yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of between 25% to 45%. Typically, medium yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content with a minimal robusta content. Low yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of less than 25%. Low yield instant coffees may be obtained using only a primary extraction at temperatures generally at or below 100° C. Typically, low yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%). In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the quality of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high quality instant coffee or a low quality instant coffee. High quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that produce a cup of brewed coffee with an aroma similar to a roast and ground coffee and have a flavor with minimal processed and Carmel notes. Typically, high quality instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%) and are produced at a low extraction yield. Low quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that have a dull or unexciting flavor that may taste stale. Typically, low quality instant coffees include a high robusta content and are produced at a high extraction yield. In some embodiments a low yield, high quality instant coffee is used. In another embodiment a high yield instant coffee is used. The structured coffee composition may employ a variety and types of instant coffee can be used, including a high yield, high quality instant coffee, a high yield, low quality instant, or a low yield, low quality instant, or one or more combinations thereof any one or more instant coffee varieties and types of instant coffee. Exemplary instant coffees can be used with the present invention to make the coffee composition, including but not limited to, those as shown below in Table 1.

In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee that may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, instant coffees may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Liquid Coffee Concentrate As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may include a liquid coffee concentrate. Liquid coffee concentrates may be purchased commercially or prepared prior to inclusion in the structured coffee composition. It has been found that when a liquid coffee concentrate is included in the preparation of a structured coffee composition, the liquid coffee concentrate may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. In one or more embodiments, a liquid coffee concentrates may be prepared by concentrating the draw-off stream from a liquid extraction process. This process utilizes hot and/or cool water and and/or steam to extract soluble coffee from roast and ground coffee. The liquid stream may then be concentrated by either thermal evaporation or freeze concentration or an alternate method. The concentrated stream of liquid coffee extract can be utilized to create a slurry, or with a roast and ground coffee with or without adding additional process water. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. An exemplary liquid coffee concentrate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,113,643 which is incorporated herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, a commercially available liquid coffee concentrate may be employed in the structured coffee composition. Liquid coffee concentrate is often sold in frozen form, and may be thawed prior to being combined with roast and ground coffee. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be characterized by the percent of coffee solids in the total volume of the liquid coffee concentrate. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may have coffee solids in an amount of about 10% to about 75%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 15% to about 70%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 20% to about 65%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 25% to about 60%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 30% to about 58%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 35% to about 55%,and in other embodiments in an amount of about 40% to about 50%. The amount of liquid coffee concentrate that may be included in the structured coffee composition should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least property such as binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, and staling resistance. In one or more embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on the overall weight of the total weight of structured coffee composition. Additional Additives The structured coffee composition may include on or more additional ingredients. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the structured coffee composition (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context.). Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included and, surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee products. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290; 6,277,428; 6,090,431; 1,951,357, and EP 813816, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. While binders included in certain embodiments, in other embodiments the structured coffee composition is free of non-coffee binders. In one or more embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added during the step of mixing the one or more ground roast coffee and the solution of one or more coffee extracts. In other embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added to the structured coffee composition (e.g., after the step of drying). Flavorants, both liquid and solid (or dry), can be included in the structured coffee products in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Créme Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. The flavorants that can be used include those known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavorants. A solid sweetener such as white granulated sugar may be used in connection with the structured coffee product. Examples of a whitening agent that can be used in connection with the structured coffee products include liquid dairy components and dry dairy components. Other suitable sweeteners that can be used in connection with the structured coffee product are those well known in the art, including both natural and artificial sweeteners, including but not limited to also high intensity sweeteners. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,706,785; 10,182,583; and 10,278,407, which disclose flavorants, sweeteners, and whitening agents for inclusion into the structured coffee products. These patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may be made with one or more layers of additives, for example, coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers on a side of the structured coffee composition (e.g., the top, bottom, or any side or rounded face of the structured coffee composition). In these or other embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers that bisect or are situated between two portions of the coffee composition in the structured coffee composition. In other various embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be made with one or more various elements including the coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc., wherein the structured coffee composition is a homogenous mixture of any one or more of the foregoing included therein. Method of Making a Structured Coffee Composition: As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract may be prepared from instant coffee. In these or other embodiments, the instant coffee may be mixed with a solvent to prepare the solution of coffee extract. Suitable solvents for used in preparing the solution of coffee extract(s) include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, brewed extracts from coffee, tea, juice, carbonated water, nitrogen infused water, and liquid CO 2 , among others. Any suitable method of mixing the instant coffee and the solvent may be used. Generally, the instant coffee and the solvent are mixed until smooth and uniform consistency is achieved. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using an instant coffee may be a slurry. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent may be from about 4:1 to about 1:2, in other embodiments from about 3:1 to about 1:1.75, in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 1:1.5, in other embodiments from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.25, in other embodiments from about 1.15:1 to about 1:15.1, in other embodiments from about 1.1:1 to about 1:1.1, and in other embodiments from about 1.05:1 to about 1:1.05. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract(s). In these or other embodiments, the solution of coffee extract(s) that includes instant coffee may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, liquid coffee concentrate may be used as or to prepare the solution of coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee extract may be used as prepared (i.e. the product of an extraction and an optional concentration). In other embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be diluted with a solvent. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using a liquid coffee concentrate may be a slurry. Regardless, in one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract. In these or other embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may include a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. For example, a solution of coffee extracts may be prepped by combining a solution prepared by combining instant coffee and a solvent with a liquid coffee concentrate. In other embodiments, the instant coffee may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate to prepare a solution of coffee extract(s). The ranges and amounts of coffee solids provided for the liquid coffee concentrate may be used in a solution of coffee extracts that includes a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. The solution of coffee extract(s) may then be combined with a ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Any suitable method of mixing the solution of coffee extract and the ground roast coffee may be used. Suitable mixing device include, but are not limited to stand mixers, spatulas, and paddle mixers. In certain embodiments, the solution of coffee extract may be sprayed on the ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Typically, prior to drying the granulated composition may be described as sticky. In one or more embodiments, the amount of solution of coffee extract and the amount of ground roast coffee in the granulated composition may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the weight of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract to the weight of the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the ratio of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract to the ground roast coffee may be from about 10:90 to about 40:60, in other embodiments from about 12.5:87.5 to about 37.5:62.5, in other embodiments from about 15:85 to about 35:65, in other embodiments from about 17.5:82.5 to about 32.5:67.5, and in other embodiments from about 20:80 to about 30:70. After the granulated composition it may be formed or otherwise shaped into a structure. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into an agglomerate with a random shape. In other embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed or molded into geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure using a press or a die. Suitable presses include a Carver Press, for example Model #3912. In these or other embodiments, a low amount of pressure or compaction should be employed in the forming of the structure so the resultant structured coffee composition is not completely compressed and includes a level of porosity. For example, a de minimis amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a pressure that slightly exceeds 0 pounds per square inch (PSI). In other embodiments, an amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a compaction of the granulated composition of between 60% and 70%. For example, a portion of the granulation composition may be molded using a target compaction travel on a carver press of 94% which is calculated by taking the amount in millimeters of the 100 percent travel of the die assembly and multiplying by 0.94 to determine the amount of travel in millimeters to achieve a 94% compaction travel target using hand compaction until the target travel is achieved thereby resulting in a compaction of 60 percent to 70 percent of the granulated coffee. After the granulated composition is formed into a structure, it may be dried to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water or other solvents may be removed by air drying, microwave drying, infrared drying, etc. After the drying step a residual amount of water, moisture, or a combination thereof may remain in the structured coffee composition. The solvent content (i.e. water, other solvents, or a combination of water and other solvents) of the of the structured coffee composition may be determined by oven drying coupled with weight analysis to provide the most universal method across solvents, allowing one to measure percent loss of the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may have a final solvent content of less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 9.75 weight percent, less than about 9.5 weight percent, less than about 9.25 weight percent, less than about 9 weight percent, less than about 8.75 weight percent, less than about 8.5 weight percent, less than about 8.25 weight percent, less than about 8 weight percent, less than about 7.75 weight percent, less than about 7.5 weight percent, less than about 7.25 weight percent, less than about 7 weight percent, less than about 6.75 weight percent, less than about 6.5 weight percent, less than about 6.25 weight percent, less than about 6 weight percent, less than about 5.75 weight percent, less than about 5.5 weight percent, less than about 5.25 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 4.75 weight percent, less than about 4.5 weight percent, less than about 4.25 weight percent, less than about 4 weight percent, less than about 3.75 weight percent, less than about 3.5 weight percent, less than about 3.25 weight percent, less than about 3 weight percent, less than about 2.75 weight percent, less than about 2.5 weight percent, less than about 2.25 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1.75 weight percent, less than about 1.5 weight percent, less than about 1.25 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the coffee composition and/or structure present. In one or more embodiments, the water content of the structured coffee composition may be described in reference to the water content of the ingredients used to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the ground roast coffee employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. In still other embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the combination of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee (i.e. the percent of water in the combined amount of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee) employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. For example, if a structured coffee composition is prepared with a ground roast coffee and an instant coffee that both have an initial water content of 3%, the structured coffee composition may have a water content with 15% of 3% (i.e., 2.55% to 3.45%).

In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the mean thickness of the coating, which may be measured using electron microscopy and/or micro computed tomography (Micro CT). In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may include a coating with a mean thickness of at least about 5 microns (μm), at least about 7.5 microns, at least about 10 microns, at least about 12.5 microns, at least about 17.5 microns, at least about 20 microns, at least about 22.5 microns, at least about 25 microns, at least about 27.5 microns, at least about 30 microns, at least about 32.5 microns, at least about 35 microns, at least about 37.5 microns, at least about 40 microns, at least about 42.5 microns, at least about 45 microns, at least about 47.5 microns, at least about 50 microns, at least about 52.5 microns, at least about 55 microns, at least about 57.5 microns, at least about 60 microns, at least about 62.5 microns, at least about 65 microns, at least about 67.5 microns, at least about 70 microns, at least about 72.5 microns, at least about 75 microns, at least about 77.5 microns, at least about 80 microns, at least about 82.5 microns, at least about 85 microns, at least about 87.5 microns, at least about 90 microns, at least about 92.5 microns, at least about 95 microns, at least about 97.5 microns, at least about 100 microns, at least about 102.5 microns, at least about 105 microns, at least about 107.5 microns, at least about 110 microns, at least about 112.5 microns, at least about 115 microns, at least about 117.5 microns, at least about 120 microns, at least about 122.5 microns, at least about 125 microns, at least about 127.5 microns, at least about 130 microns, at least about 132.5 microns, at least about 135 microns, at least about 137.5 microns, at least about 140 microns, at least about 142.5 microns, at least about 145 microns, at least about 147.5 microns, at least about 150 microns, at least about 152.5 microns, at least about 155 microns, at least about 157.5 microns, at least about 160 microns, at least about 162.5 microns, at least about 165 microns, at least about 167.5 microns, at least about 170 microns, at least about 172.5 microns, at least about 175 microns, at least about 177.5 microns, at least about 180 microns, at least about 182.5 microns, at least about 185 microns, at least about 187.5 microns, at least about 190 microns, at least about 192.5 microns, at least about 195 microns, at least about 197.5 microns, at least about 200 microns, at least about 202.5 microns, at least about 205 microns, at least about 207.5 microns, at least about 210 microns, at least about 212.5 microns, at least about 215 microns, at least about 217.5 microns, at least about 220 microns, at least about 222.5 microns, at least about 225 microns, at least about 227.5 microns, at least about 230 microns, at least about 232.5 microns, at least about 235 microns, at least about 237.5 microns, at least about 240 microns, at least about 242.5 microns, at least about 245 microns, at least about 247.5 microns, at least about 250 microns, at least about 252.5 microns, at least about 255 microns, at least about 257.5 microns, at least about 260 microns, at least about 262.5 microns, at least about 265 microns, at least about 267.5 microns, at least about 270 microns, at least about 272.5 microns, at least about 275 microns, at least about 277.5 microns, at least about 280 microns, at least about 282.5 microns, at least about 285 microns, at least about 287.5 microns, at least about 290 microns, at least about 292.5 microns, at least about 295 microns, at least about 297.5 microns, or even at least about 300 microns.

Composition Size and Configuration: Although the structured coffee compositions may be made in any size and/or three-dimensional geometric shape, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produce a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, an structured coffee may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and can optionally be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to break any coffee structure made from the one or more coffee compositions into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e., break a molded product/pellet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as one-half of a standard serving, or one-third of standard serving, or one-quarter of standard serving. The end user/consumer may add or reduce the number of coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference, to achieve brewed coffee that is weaker or stronger than normal. Since, in one embodiment, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756, 869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; and 9,474,290, which disclose methods of adjusting the weakness or strength of a standard brewed coffee, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. Furthermore, about one (1) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about one (1) cup of coffee; or about three (3) standard servings of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or about four (4) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or even about five (5) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of dimensions, the process and ingredients the structured coffee composition may have a cylindrical structure measuring about 29 mm to about 33 mm in diameter and about 19.5 mm to about 32 mm in thickness and about 14.0 cm3 to about 27.0 cm3 in volume, which can have variations thereabout as further described below and shown in FIG. 2, and Tables 2, 3, and 4. The diameter and thickness can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 6.5 grams, about 7.5 grams, about 8.5 grams, about 10.5 grams, or even about 12.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 13 grams, about 15 grams, about 17 grams, about 21 grams, or even about 25 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 19.5 grams, about 22.5 grams, about 25.5 grams, about 31.5 grams, or even about 37.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 26 grams, about 30 grams, about 34 grams, about 42 grams, or even about 50 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. Similarly, structured coffee compositions made with different dose sizes, e.g., a coffee product made to produce one-third of a standard serving of brewed coffee per structure or molded product, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different structure configurations for the structured coffee composition are also possible. For example, cylinder, cube, cuboid, sphere, pellet, ellipsoid, triangular pyramid, hexagonal prism, truncated triangular pyramid, truncated square pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, truncated hexagonal pyramid, cone, truncated cone, diamond, a three dimensional shape with an oval-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with heart-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with triangle-shaped face, or pillow shape are contemplated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical molded structure can, if so desired, be concave or convex. Additionally, or alternatively, the outer surface of a structure or molded product can have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be in the form of a particulate or an agglomeration of particles. See FIG. 1 for examples of structural shapes. It should also be noted that comparative examples are shown in some tables and figures herein, which can be labeled “Tablet Example”. The comparative example, “Tablet Example”, is a coffee tablet made using a multi-step compaction process as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Resistance to Staling In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a resistance to staling or a reduced perception of staling. Resistance to staling may be measured through the quantification of lipid oxidation byproducts, such as hexanal, that are known to be generated during coffee staling and contribute to the perception of stale coffee particulate or products. Reduced perception of staling in roasted coffee particulate or products by the end user (consumer) once brewed, can be measured though the use of a trained sensory panel calibrated to identify stale notes, such as “papery,” in a coffee brew. Advantageously, the structured coffee compositions may protect coffee flavor from one or more negative organoleptic effects, such as development of paper off-notes, of staling, especially those staling effects caused by lipid oxidation. In one embodiment, this is accomplished via the use of a coated coffee particulate or product (i.e., roasted and ground coffee or coffee structures formed from a roasted and ground coffee particulate or product that has been coated in any manner discussed herein) which may limit exposure of such a coffee particulate or product to environmental conditions that cause or result in enhanced lipid oxidation. In addition, the structured coffee compositions minimize surface area to volume ratios for coffee particulate or products that will be exposed to oxidative forces, further minimizing lipid oxidation and staling thereof. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by exposing structured coffee compositions to UV light for a period of 4 days in a UV light box. After the exposure to UV light, the structured coffee compositions may be brewed and assessed by expert panelists for staling. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). The staling data may be reported along with the exposed surface area (i.e., the area of the surface that is exposed to light divided by the total volume of the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.5, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 1. Stated differently, the brewed coffee is perceived as not stale. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.82, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 2. Stated differently the brewed coffee is perceived to have a very slight off note. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by aging the coffee under UV lights and testing determining the hexanal content. The coffee may be aged by exposing the structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 7 days. After the exposure to UV light, the structured coffee compositions may be brewed and the amount of hexanal may be determined. In one or more embodiments, the amount of hexanal after a week of exposure of light in the coated coffee particles may be less than 40 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 30 ng/g, other embodiments less than 25 ng/g, and in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g. Packaging and Use: The structured coffee compositions are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages and/or packaging. Due to the resistance to staling of the structured coffee compositions, they allow for reduction of packaging materials and lowers packaging cost. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; woven and nonwoven filter paper, a nylon mesh material, boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. Moreover, the instant coated slurry and/or liquid coffee concentrate can even be used to coat the inside of a package or packaging material for the coffee compositions and/or coffee structures thereof. If desired, the structured coffee compositions can be packaged in any desired number so that each packaged amount can be designed to yield any desired number of brewed coffee servings and/or strengths. For example, structured coffee compositions are in one embodiment designed to produce a single serving of coffee per coffee composition and/or structures thereof can be packaged individually to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, in groups of two to facilitate making two cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of three to facilitate making three cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle and so forth up to groups of twelve to facilitate making twelve cups of coffee in a single brew. The structured coffee compositions may be packaged with more or less of the same to produce stronger or weaker coffee for a standard brew of coffee since, in one embodiment, the coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) can be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. Furthermore, in yet other embodiments designed to produce a single serving of coffee per structured coffee composition can be packaged individually as structured coffee composition to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, or can be packaged in a group of three (3) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of about four (4) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of even about five (5) structured coffee compositions coffee to facilitate making about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. The packaging for the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the structured coffee compositions are periodically used by the consumer, the unused structured coffee compositions that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. One advantage is that two or more structured coffee compositions may be, via two different coffee compositions or structures formed from each respective different structured coffee composition, combined in the same brew to produce a preferred brew in which the one or more properties resulting from the combination of different coffee compositions or structures provide a desired variation, change or combination in flavor, strength, caffeine content, or other such characteristic in the preferred brew. A wide variety of types of structured coffee compositions can be provided together in a pre-packaged kit, or in a consumer selected array, to facilitate preparation of a preferred brew specific to an individual consumer's preferences. As such, an exemplary kit may include a plurality of varied structured coffee compositions, with at least two of the varied structured coffee compositions having a different predetermined property, such as, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, level of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee, or type, of coffee bean treatment. Such a kit can be provided with instructions for combining the two or more types of coffee composition to prepare a desired brewed coffee. These instructions may include one or more “recipes” for preparing one or more special predetermined blends of coffee. The present invention may be packaged as coffee compositions (if in loose powdered form) and/or as an appropriate number of structured coffee compositions. See various methods of packaging and use of coffee compositions and products as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition Properties: In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with brewing water of a desired and/or suitable temperature (any temperature could be used, e.g., 1° C. to 100° C., as both hot and cold coffee brews are desirable) at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated herein. The strength/robustness of the structured coffee compositions may conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a product's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the structure in an axial direction over the height of the structure or across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure. Product hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the structure is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the structure breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the structure to break is taken as the hardness of the structure, which is sometimes referred to as the “structure crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. As shown in Table 2 below and FIGS. 3A and 3B, the structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the height or axial direction of the structure in the range of about 21.3 N (Newtons) to about 61.7 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 20 N to about 65 N, about 22.5 N to about 62.5 N, about 25 N to about 60 N, about 27.5 N to about 57.5 N, about 30 N to about 55 N, about 32.5 N to about 52.5 N, about 35 N to about 50 N, about 37.5 N to about 47.5 N, about 40 N to about 45 N or even about 42.5 N. The structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure in the range of about 11.1 N (Newtons) to about 51.6 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 10 N to about 52.5 N, about 12.5 N to about 50 N, about 15 N to about 45 N, about 17.5 N to about 42.5 N, about 20 N to about 40 N, about 20 N to about 37.5 N, about 22.5 N to about 35 N, about 25 N to about 32.5 N, or even about 30 N.

For convenience, the friability of the structured coffee compositions can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating the structure in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these structures that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The structures should not be broken to obtain the weight of the structure in grams, but adjust the number of whole structures to come as close as possible to weight of the structure in grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of structures represents the friability of these structures. As shown in Table 3 below and in FIG. 4, it has been found that the structured coffee compositions can have a friability in the range of about 50 to 55 percent to about 100 percent (total disintegration of the coffee structure), of about 57.5 percent to about 97.5 percent, of about 60 percent to about 95 percent, of about 62.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, of about 65 percent to about 90 percent, of about 67.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, of about 70 percent to about 85 percent, of about 72.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, of about 75 percent to about 80 percent, or even about 77.5 percent.

Water activity may be determined using a water activity meter such as a Rotronic Hygrolab Water Activity Meter. In one or more embodiments, structured coffee compositions may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. Furthermore, as shown in Table 4 (water activity data) above, the structured coffee compositions having the above combination of properties of about stated values and/or within claimed ranges for hardness, friability, and density within the diameter and height measurements and the about stated target weights may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. It has been further found that the structured coffee compositions achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise conventional ground roast coffee composition. That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the structured coffee composition is used in a typical ADC coffee maker or other brewing devices than when the same amount of conventional ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. This feature is illustrated in the following Working Examples, Examples #1 through #4, Tables 5, 7, 8, 10 through 12, and as shown in FIGS. 6 through 9, which show that the yield ratios provided by the structured coffee compositions, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the structured coffee compositions relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of conventional ground roast coffee (e.g., the ground roast coffee used to prepare the structured coffee composition) is normally greater than about 1 and in many instances greater than about 1.1, greater than about 1.2, greater than about 1.25, greater than about 1.5, greater than about 1.75, greater than about 2, greater than about 2.25, greater, than about 2.5, greater than about 2.75, and even about 3 on a weight basis. As discussed herein, various particle sizes for the roast and ground coffee may be used, which may result in various percent brew solids, density, and percent porosity in the molded product. Porosity is measured by Micro-CT (also called microtomography or micro-computed tomography). In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity (i.e., percent of total volume) in the structured coffee compositions may greater than 40%, greater than 42.5%, greater than 45% or greater than 47.5%, or greater than 50%, or greater than 52.5%, or greater than 55%, or greater than 57.5%, or greater than 60%. In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity in the structured coffee compositions may range between from about 40% to about 80%, or from about 42.5% to about 77.5%, or from about 45% to about 75%, or from about 47.5% to about 72.5%, or from about 50% to about 70%, or from about 52.5% to about 67.5%, or from about 55% to about 65%, or from about 57.5% to about 62.5%, or even about 60%. See FIGS. 12A through 13B for depictions of cross sections of cylindrical and spherical molded products of exemplary embodiments of the structured coffee compositions which depicts the Micro-CT of the porosity in structured coffee compositions. Various samples of structures with various particle size distribution of roast and ground coffee, shapes, and grind sizes were studied as shown below in Tables 5 and 6 below.

For measurement of the percent (%) brew solids (% BS) used herein the refractive index (RI) is measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. Then a linear regression equation is developed and used to correlate the RI to % BS. Working Examples: Working Example 1: Automatic Drip Coffee (ADC) maker examples were completed with the present invention and its various constituents for determining the amount of brew solids present in the coffee brew. For all ADC brew methods 1420 mL of PUR filtered tap water was used. Molded or formed coffee structures/products used four 8.5 gram pellets (34 grams in total) of the structured coffee compositions (made with Folgers Classic roast and ground coffee and Colcafe PMD instant coffee), Folgers Classic roast and ground used 34 grams, and Colcafe PMD instant coffee used 6.8 grams for the various coffee brews thereof. The first brewing method took data points every 2 minutes throughout the duration of the brew, i.e., cumulative brew cycles, which is shown in Table 7 and FIG. 6. Samples were taken by cycling beakers under the drip spout. Total weight of each beaker was taken prior to collecting a sample. A total of 3 replicates were collected using this method. This method was used to show the extraction strength of a brew at each time point and to demonstrate the total strength of the brew as the extraction time increases.

Molded or formed coffee structures/products used the structured coffee compositions made with Folgers Classic roast and ground and Colcafe PMD instant coffee for the various coffee brews thereof. There were about ten (N=10) replicates of each coffee structure that were analyzed for percent brew solids (% BS or percent (%) brew solids). The refractive index (RI) of the brewed coffee sample was measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+, temperature set to 29. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. The percent (%) brew solids was calculated using the following equation percent (%) brew solids=(RI*549.209)-731.575. See Tables 8 and 9, and FIG. 7.

For all single serve brew methods, the examples were completed on the standard cup setting using PUR filtered tap water. Molded or formed coffee structures/products used one 8.5 gram pellet (made from Folgers Classic roast and ground and Colcafe PMD instant coffee), one 8.5 gram Folgers Classic roast and ground pellet, or 1.7 grams Colcafe PMD of instant coffee. The first brew method took individual samples in 10 second intervals throughout the duration of the brew cycle, i.e., cumulative brew cycles, which is shown in Table 10 and FIG. 8. Total weight of each beaker was taken prior to collecting a sample. A total of 3 replicates were conducted using this method. This method was used to show the extraction strength of a brew at each time point. The second brew method brewed coffee structures at incremental extraction times, the extraction was stopped at 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds, i.e., individual brew lengths, which is shown in Table 12. For each time point a new brew was run. Whereas with the previous method multiple samples were taken per brew, with this method only one data point was taken per brew. A single replicate was used for this method. This method was used to demonstrate the total strength of the brew as the extraction time increases.

Conventional cold brew formulations used the Dunkin Donuts' Cold Brew retail formula for the control samples. The present invention used the Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew retail formula for roast and ground and Colcafe PMD instant coffee for the quick cold brew (QCB) formulations. Two different quick cold brew tests examples were run, one using ten (10) 8.5 gram target weight invention structures and the other using four (4) 8.5 gram target weight invention structures. The coffee was encased in standard filter paper pods for brewing. The ten count brew process yielded a coffee that was deemed too strong flavor-wise for most people and is better over ice. The four count brew process with a brew time of 2 hours yielded a coffee that was preferred by people in terms of strength, smooth taste, and character. The present invention when used for quick cold brew coffee provides a bold cold brew coffee strength to remain bold when served over ice. It uses less coffee and brews in a shorter time frame than conventional cold brew formulations to provide a consistent brew. The percent brew solids for the cold brew tests are shown in Table 13 below. Cold brew disassociation examples were also performed as well. A large pitcher was filled with 1700 ml of PUR filtered room temperature water. For the present invention, eight (8) pellets were weighed out for a total of approximately 70 grams, 70 grams for roast and ground, and 13.6 grams for instant coffee. The coffee was encased in standard filter paper pods for brewing. Each sample steeped for a total time of 3 hours with extractions taken at every 30 minute period for percent brew solids (% BS) analysis. A total of 3 replicates were conducted using this method. The present invention used for cold brew coffee disassociates and brews rapidly in both room temperature and cold water applications, which is shown in Table 14 and FIG. 9. The present invention disassociates in hot water (196.5-202° F.) in about 15 to about 21 seconds, in room temperature water (72-72.3° F.) in about 1 minute 7 seconds to about 1 minute 24 seconds, and in cold water (38.7-42.3° F.) in about 2 minutes 51 seconds to about 4 minutes 12 seconds.

No. 10/845,742, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,968,775, filed May 14, 2004, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/471,926, filed May 19, 2003. This invention relates generally to improvements in devices and systems for brewing coffee or the like. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved coffee brewer utilizing streams of heated water for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds, to yield brewed coffee having improved flavor and enhanced aroma and other characteristics. Drip-style coffee brewers are available in a wide range of different configurations and sizes for use in residential or commercial environments to produce brewed coffee. Such coffee brewers commonly include a water reservoir from which a controlled volume of water is heated and then dispensed downwardly by dripping or spraying onto coffee grounds contained within an underlying, upwardly open brew basket. The hot water intermixes with the coffee grounds to produce the desired brewed coffee beverage which is drained from the brew basket through a filter element into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In one common form, the brewer includes a refillable water reservoir from which the water is delivered through a heating element for drip-flow dispensing into the brew basket. Alternately, the brewer may be coupled directly to a tap water supply or the like. While drip-style coffee brewers of the above described type have been used extensively for many years, the flavor and other characteristics of the brewed coffee is inconsistent and, in many cases, can be of marginal or unacceptable quality. Such problems are believed to stem from inadequate and/or inconsistent intermixing of the hot water with the coffee grounds contained in the brew basket, resulting in brewed coffee exhibiting inconsistent flavor and body traits, often including unacceptable bitter taste attributes. In this regard, the downward dispensing of hot water onto the initially dry coffee grounds in the underlying brew basket can produce erosion-type channels through the coffee grounds, wherein such channels can permit a significant portion of the water volume to pass through the coffee grounds and drip from the brew basket without significantly wetting or otherwise adequately intermixing therewith. While this channeling problem can sometimes be mitigated by carefully pre-distributing the coffee grounds substantially uniformly within the brew basket, significant attention to this aspect of the coffee brewing process is seldom given. A variety of modified coffee brewers and related brewing processes have been provided in an attempt to overcome these problems and disadvantages by providing improved intermixing between the heated water and the coffee grounds within a filtered brew basket. In general, such concepts utilize mechanical stirring devices for improving thorough contact between the heated water and the coffee grounds. While such concepts may provide brewed coffee with enhanced and/or more consistent flavor characteristics, they inherently incorporate moving parts that increase the overall complexity and cost of the coffee brewer, and are susceptible to occasional break-down to require periodic repair or replacement. There exists, therefore, a continuing need for further improvements in and to coffee brewers and related coffee brewing processes for achieving significantly improved intermixing between heated water and coffee grounds, for providing brewed coffee of consistent high quality and improved flavor and other desirable attributes, without requiring mechanical stirring devices and their attendant disadvantages. The present invention fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, an improved coffee brewer and brewing method are provided for producing brewed coffee with improved flavor. The coffee brewer includes a removably mounted brew basket having jet ports connected to a source of heated water and positioned to deliver hot water streams into the brew basket at a location for turbulently agitating and stirring coffee grounds contained therein to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds for improved flavor extraction. This fluidized bed is directed against one or more mesh filter elements forming a wall portion of the brew basket for outward passage of the thus-produced coffee which is then directed into an underlying carafe or the like. In one preferred form, the coffee brewer includes a water reservoir coupled via a first check valve for flow in heat transfer relation with a heating unit. The heating unit elevates the temperature of the water substantially to the boiling point, whereupon the heated water flows through a second check valve to the brew basket. The heated water flows to and through the jet ports into the interior of the brew basket, with at least some of the jet ports being disposed at a position beneath the level of coffee grounds contained therein. As a result, the heated water is jetted or sprayed into and thoroughly wets the coffee grounds with an agitating and stirring action that is effective to lift, suspend, and turbulently stir the grounds in a manner to produce a substantially fluidized bed of water-borne grounds. In the preferred form, the jet ports are oriented for rotationally stirring the coffee grounds with a substantial spinning or orbital path of motion. The fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds provides improved and consistent intermixing of the heated water with the coffee grounds for enhanced flavor extraction with minimal bitter and/or other undesirable attributes. This spinning fluidized bed is directed by centrifugal action in a generally radially outward direction against an inboard side wall of the brew basket, a portion of which is defined by the mesh filter element or elements which permit outward flow-through passage of the brewed liquid coffee while substantially preventing outward passage of the coffee grounds. The brewed coffee passed through the filter element or elements is directed further as by gravity flow into an underlying coffee pot such as a carafe or decanter. In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention, a frontal portion of the brew basket side wall comprises a substantially transparent window visible from the exterior of the coffee brewer, when the brew basket mounted is thereon. During a brewing cycle, the spinning fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket is thus externally observable. A light may be provided generally at or inclose proximity to the transparent window, for illuminating the visible brewing process. In a preferred form, the light such as an LED or the like is mounted onto the brewer for slide-fit reception into a pocket or recess formed in the brew basket generally at a lower margin of the basket window, when the brew basket is mounted onto the brewer. The region of the light pocket or recess, or the light itself, may be frosted for improved light dispersal and distribution across the window area. In the preferred form, the light is positioned in an at least slightly spaced relation from an inboard side of the basket window, thereby defining a chamber between the light and window through which a portion of the water-borne coffee grounds may circulate during a brew cycle, with such portion being back-illuminated by the light. The light is turned on at the initiation of the brew process, and may be adapted to turn off at the conclusion of the brew process thereby providing a visual indication that the brew process has been completed. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As shown in the exemplary drawings, an improved coffee brewer referred to generally in FIGS. 1-6 by the reference numeral 10 is provided for rapid and consistent high quality brewing of coffee. The coffee brewer 10 includes a brew basket 12 (FIGS. 4-10) for receiving a selected quantity of ground coffee (not shown). In accordance with a primary aspect of the invention, the brew basket 12 is adapted for connection to a source of heated water, and includes at least one and preferably a plurality of jet ports 14 (FIGS. 7 and 9 - 11 ) positioned for agitating and turbulently stirring the coffee grounds to produce a substantially fluidized bed of suspended and water-borne coffee grounds within the brew basket 12 . This fluidized bed results in substantially improved and intimately thorough wetting contact and intermixing between the hot water and the coffee grounds, for achieving enhanced flavor extraction to consistently produce a high quality, fuller-bodied and more robust coffee beverage. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention is shown generally in one preferred form in FIGS. 1-6. As depicted, the coffee brewer 10 comprises a relatively compact base 16 having a platen 18 formed or carried thereon with a size and shape suitable for secure rested support of a coffee pot 20 such as a carafe or decanter or the like. An on-off button 22 is exposed at a front side of the base 16 and may be depressed manually when brewing of a pot of coffee is desired, as will be described in more detail. A power cord 24 (FIG. 1) protrudes rearwardly from the base 16 for connecting the brewer 10 to a suitable electrical power source. A support post 26 extends upwardly from a rear side of the base 16 to support an upper brewer head 28 in a positioned generally cantilevered over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 supported on the base platen 18 . In general terms, the brewer head 28 comprises a relatively compact housing structure defining a water reservoir 30 (FIGS. 3-4) for receiving a selected volume of water for use in brewing a pot of coffee, in combination with an upwardly open cavity 32 (FIGS. 4-6) for removably supporting the brew basket 12 . Upon depression of the on-off button 22 , water within the reservoir 30 is delivered in heat exchange relation with a heating unit 34 shown mounted within the base 16 as viewed in FIG. 6, and further to the brewer basket jet ports 14 for delivery into the interior of the brew basket 12 in the form of a plurality of pressurized or jetted hot water streams. These hot water jets turbulently stir and intermix with coffee grounds contained within the brew basket 12 to produce the fluidized bed or suspension of coffee grounds within a spinning and swirling body of water within the brew basket, to produce the improved, high quality, and consistent coffee beverage in accordance with the invention. It is believed that the circulating particulate grounds produce an increased proportion of relatively microscopic fines due to abrading action during circulation. This coffee beverage is filtered and delivered from the brew basket to the underlying coffee pot or carafe 20 , ready for immediate use and enjoyment. In the filtered state, a substantial proportion of the small fines remain in the coffee beverage wherein such fines contribute to the rich coffee flavor. More particularly, as shown in more detail in FIGS. 3-6, the illustrative brewer head 28 includes an upper housing bowl 29 with an internal, generally vertically oriented divider wall 36 subdividing the brewer head 28 into the upwardly open water reservoir 30 occupying a rearward region of the head 28 , and the brewer basket cavity 32 at a forward region of the head 28 . A rear hinged lid 38 is provided on the brewer head 28 for normally closing the water reservoir 30 , but this lid 38 is adapted for quick and easy pivoting movement to an open position (as viewed in FIGS. 3-4) to permit a selected volume of water to be poured into the reservoir 30 . In a typical residential coffee maker, the reservoir 30 may be sized for receiving a standardized volume of water, such as a water volume sufficient to brew a standardized volume of coffee, such as 8, 10 or 12 cups. Alternately, the brewer head 28 may include volumetric gradation marks (not shown) indicating the volume of water contained therein, to facilitate brewing of different selected volumes of coffee. As a further alternative, persons skilled in the art will recognize and appreciate that the coffee brewer 10 may be connected directly to a tap water source or the like, in lieu of the reservoir 30 for pour-in reception of a selected water volume. The upper housing bowl 29 defining the water reservoir 30 is mounted on a lower housing shell 39 (shown best in FIGS. 5-6) which is supported at an upper end of the support post 26 in cantilevered relation spaced above the base 16 . Water within the reservoir 30 is coupled through a port 40 formed in a bottom wall of the upper bowl 29 (FIG. 6) to an underlying receiver 44 which is mounted on the lower shell 39 within a compartment 46 defined cooperatively between the upper bowl 29 and lower shell 39 . This receiver 44 may include a spring-loaded valve positioned for engagement by the upper bowl 29 for movement to an open position permitting downward water flow from the reservoir 30 , when the upper bowl 29 is mounted on the lower shell 39 . Such downward water flow proceeds through the receiver 44 and further through a short supply conduit 48 (FIGS. 5-6) which couples the water downflow to a passage 50 formed in the support post 26 and further to the heating unit 34 . A first check valve 45 (FIG. 6) is mounted along this passage 50 within the support post 26 to permit water downflow, but to prevent upward backflow from the heating unit 34 toward the reservoir 30 . The heating unit 34 , although depicted generally in FIG. 6 by dotted lines, comprises a standard dual pathway device of the type known in the art for use in coffee brewers. In particular, the heating unit 34 incorporates an electrical resistance heating element mounted within one annular pathway and disposed in heat transfer relation with water flow through an adjacent annular pathway. One exemplary dual pathway heating unit of this general type is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,956, which is incorporated by reference herein. With this construction, the water downflow through the post passage 50 is circulated though the water pathway of the heating unit 34 which heats the water substantially to boiling. A downstream end of the water pathway through the heating unit 34 is coupled to a second flow passage 52 (FIG. 6) for upward or return flow to the brewer head 28 . The upward return flow passage 52 through the support post 26 delivers the heated water through a short transition conduit 54 to an inverted, generally U-shaped turn 56 positioned within the water reservoir 30 and disposed at least slightly above a maximum fill level of the reservoir. This inverted and elevated conduit turn 56 prevents water within the reservoir 30 from draining past the turn 56 when the reservoir is filled with water. A downstream end of the inverted conduit turn 56 is coupled by an additional supply conduit 58 to a second check valve 60 mounted at the underside of the upper bowl 29 to permit one-way flow-through passage of water from the supply conduit 58 to brew basket 12 , but prevents backflow of water to the conduit 58 . More particularly, the second check valve 60 is positioned in aligned relation with an inflow port 62 (FIGS. 3 and 6) formed in the bottom wall of the upper housing bowl 29 , at a location generally centered within the brew basket cavity 32 . In this regard, as shown best in FIGS. 8 and 10, the brew basket 12 includes a downwardly open feed port 64 having a size and shape for seated reception on the underlying inflow port 62 , when the brew basket 12 is positioned within the brew cavity 32 . This feed port 64 communicates water inflow from the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 of the brew basket 12 . The brew basket 12 may comprise a generally bowl-shaped component constructed primarily from lightweight molded plastic or the like, to provide a generally upwardly open geometry defined by a bottom wall 66 joined to an upstanding side wall 68 of generally cylindrical configuration. The bottom wall 68 is formed to include the downwardly open feed port 64 for communicating hot water inflow upwardly into a false bottom or plenum chamber 70 (FIG. 10) which distributes the hot water flow to at least one and preferably a plurality of hollow ribs 72 formed in the side wall 68 . In the preferred configuration as shown, three of said hollow ribs 72 are formed in the side wall 68 at approximate 120° intervals, and each of these ribs 72 includes a closed upper end and has at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed along the height thereof for jetting hot water streams into the interior of the brew basket 12 . FIGS. 6-7 and 9 - 10 illustrate each hollow rib 72 with a pair of vertically spaced jet ports 14 positioned and aimed for jetting water streams generally tangentially in a common swirling direction (clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 9) into the brew basket interior. At least the lower jet ports 14 on the hollow ribs 72 are positioned at a level below a normal level or upper surface of a bed of dry coffee grounds placed into the brew basket 12 for brewing coffee, as indicated approximately by the dotted line 74 in FIG. 10. Thus, when the hot water is jetted through the jet ports 14 , at least a portion of the hot water stirs and agitates the body of coffee grounds to initiate a swirling or spinning action to create the fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. That is, upon initial supply of hot water into the brew basket 12 , water passing through the lower jets 14 stirs and agitates the initially dry coffee grounds, whereas the upper jets may be disposed above the upper surface of the coffee grounds and thereby initially spray onto and wet that upper surface. As hot water flow continues, the brew basket 12 gradually fills substantially with water, while the agitating and stirring action of the lower jets continues. As the brew basket fills with water, the water level eventually increases to a point higher than the upper jets 14 , as indicated approximately by the dotted line 76 in FIG. 10, whereby the upper and lower jets 14 cooperatively stir and agitate the combined body of coffee grounds and water to suspend and swirl the coffee grounds in the form of a water-borne fluidized dispersion. Such action exposes the entire volume of the coffee grounds to the heated water thoroughly and substantially uniformly, and for substantially for the entire period of the brew cycle, to result in a significantly improved and consistently high quality brewed coffee beverage. A removable cap 77 is normally provided to close the top of the brew basket 12 and thereby prevent undesired spilling of water or coffee grounds therefrom during the brewing procedure. In one preferred form as illustrated in FIG. 11, the jets ports 14 formed along the hollow ribs 72 of the brew basket 12 may be designed for minimizing or eliminating undesirable inflow or ingestion of particle-laden coffee when the supply of hot water to the jet ports 14 terminates. As shown in FIG. 11, each jet port 14 can be shaped to define a tapered profile with a cross sectional size that reduces toward a downstream or discharge end thereof, in combination with a filter screen 15 which can be formed as by in-place plastic molding generally at an upstream or inlet end of the jet port 14 . Upon supply of hot water to the jet port, the water passes freely through the filter screen 15 and then outwardly through the jet port 14 at a substantial velocity for intermixing with the coffee grounds within the brew basket. Upon cessation of the hot water flow, any particulate grounds which may flow or be drawn into the jet port 14 are collected on the downstream side of the filter screen 15 , where they cannot clog internal flow passages of the coffee maker apparatus. Instead, such collected grounds are retained on the screen 15 where they are hydraulically delivered back into the brew basket 12 during a subsequent brew cycle. Alternative structures for capturing ingested coffee grounds and/or for preventing backflow of such coffee grounds into and/or through the jet ports 14 will be apparent to persons skilled in the art. The thus-produced fluidized bed is swirled by centrifugal action against the inboard side of the brew basket side wall 68 , a portion of which is defined by one or more mesh or mesh-like filter elements 78 . Such filter elements 78 are supported by the brew basket 12 in slightly spaced relation to the adjacent divider wall 36 to define a flow pathway for brewed coffee to pass therebetween to a drip outlet port 79 (FIG. 6) formed in the upper bowl 29 and an underlying drip outlet port 80 (FIGS. 5-6) formed in the lower shell 39 . This latter outlet port 80 is positioned over the upwardly open coffee pot 20 , whereby the brewed coffee flows downwardly for collection within the pot 20 . As viewed in FIGS. 1-6, the brew basket cavity 32 formed in the upper housing bowl 29 may intersect and thereby interrupt a forward region of the bowl 29 , to form an arcuate recess 83 to expose a frontal portion or segment 82 of the brew basket 12 at a front side of the brewer head 28 . In this regard, this exposed frontal segment 82 of the brew basket 12 is desirably formed from a transparent or partially transparent material to permit visual observation of the swirling and spinning fluidized bed during the brewing procedure. A lower margin of the recess 83 in the upper bowl 29 is disposed above the drip outlet port 79 . The removable cap 77 may also be formed from a transparent or partially transparent material. In use, to brew a pot of coffee, a selected volume of water is poured into the water reservoir 30 , and the brew basket 12 containing a selected quantity of ground coffee is placed into the associated brew basket cavity 32 in the brewer head 28 . A portion of the water within the reservoir 30 will flow downwardly through the first check valve 45 to fill the associated pathway within the heating unit 34 . Then, upon depression of the on-off button 22 , the heating unit 34 is energized to raise the temperature of the water therein substantially to boiling, resulting in pressure-forced pumping the hot water upwardly through the inverted and elevated inverted conduit turn 56 and further through the second check valve 60 to the jet ports 14 within the brew basket 12 . This upwardly pumped water is replaced by continued water downflow from the reservoir 30 , for heating by the heating unit 34 , until the reservoir 30 reaches a substantially empty condition. The hot water is jetted into the interior of the brew basket 12 via the jet ports 14 , as described, to generate the swirling turbulent fluidized bed of water-borne coffee grounds. The thus-brewed coffee is filtered through the mesh filter elements 78 for delivery into the underlying pot 20 , wherein the brewed coffee may be retained in a heated state by suitably controlling the heating unit 34 for heating the platen 18 . Alternately, the heating unit 34 may be designed to de-activate and the brewed coffee may be retained within an insulated decanter. Following this brew cycle, the brew basket 12 may be removed from the brewer head 28 for appropriate cleaning and discarding of the spent coffee grounds retained on the filter elements. Thereafter, the brew basket 12 may be refilled with coffee grounds for a subsequent brew cycle. The improved coffee brewer 10 of the present invention thus produces brewed coffee by means of intimately thorough and consistent intermixing between the hot water and coffee grounds, to produce a coffee beverage of repeatable high quality taste and other characteristics. In addition, because the heated water passes directly into the coffee grounds, the resultant steam rising from the fluidized bed is believed to carry enhanced or intensified coffee aroma, thereby producing an enhanced of more enjoyable coffee brewing experience. FIGS. 12-20 depict a modified coffee brewer 110 constructed in accordance with one alternative preferred form of the invention. For sake of clarity and ease of description, components common to those shown and described in FIGS. 1-11 are identified by common reference numerals, whereas modified components which correspond generally in terms of function with those shown and described in FIGS. 1-11 are identified by common reference numerals increased by 100 . In general terms, the modified coffee brewer 110 of FIGS. 12-19 includes an externally visible light 84 positioned generally within a transparent frontal segment 182 or front window for illuminating the visible brewing process. More particularly, the modified coffee brewer 110 generally comprises a lower support base 16 defining a platen 18 for removably supporting a coffee pot 20 . The pot 20 is positioned beneath an upper brewer head 28 mounted on an upstanding support post 26 . An on-off button or switch 22 is provided on the front of the support base 16 for initiating a brew cycle. The upper brewer head 28 comprises an upwardly open housing bowl 29 carrying a hinged lid 138 for normally closing and covering the otherwise open top of the bowl 29 , as viewed in FIG. 12. The hinged lid 138 can be pivoted upwardly to an open position, as viewed in FIGS. 14-15, to expose the bowl interior which includes a central divider wall 36 separating the bowl interior into a rearwardly disposed water reservoir 30 and a forwardly disposed brew basket cavity 32 . A hinged cap 177 is shown for normally closing and covering the brew basket cavity 32 . A modified brew basket 112 is removably seated within this cavity 32 , for supporting a selected quantity of ground coffee in the course of a coffee brewing cycle. Importantly, in this modified embodiment, water from the reservoir 30 is coupled through an appropriate heating element for delivery via an inflow port 62 (FIG. 15) to the brew basket 112 , in the same manner as shown and described previously herein with respect to FIGS. 1-11. As shown in FIGS. 12-15, the light 84 is positioned generally at the front of the brew basket cavity 32 , generally centered at a lower margin of the front-open arcuate recess 83 . The light 84 comprises a relatively small light element preferably such as an LED upstanding a short distance at this lower margin of the recess 83 . In one preferred form, the light 84 incorporates a translucent bulb body such as a frosted bulb for providing broad and relatively uniform dispersal of generated light energy, substantially without providing a sharp point of light. Alternately, persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a non-frosted bulb may also be used. Persons skilled in the art will also recognize that a variety of different light sources may be used, including but not limited to incandescent bulbs and the like. The brew basket 112 (FIGS. 15-19) is generally constructed as previously shown and described to include an underside feed port (not shown) for registry with the inflow port 62 when the brew basket 112 is seated within the cavity 32 for a brew cycle. Hot water from the inflow port 62 thus enters a false bottom or plenum chamber (also not shown) of the brew basket 112 , for flow further to and upwardly through a plurality of upstanding hollow ribs 72 each having at least one and preferably multiple jet ports 14 formed therein. As previously described, these jet ports 14 deliver the hot water in jetted streams into the brew basket interior for turbulently agitating and stirring the coffee grounds during a brew cycle. At least one and preferably a plurality of these jet ports 14 are disposed below the surface level of the coffee grounds contained within the brew basket, as previously shown and described. The frontal segment 182 of the brew basket 112 comprises a forwardly protruding structure having a size and shape for substantially seated reception within the arcuate recess 83 . Accordingly, this frontal segment 182 defines a generally U-shaped shoulder 88 which protrudes forwardly from the otherwise generally truncated conical profile of the brew basket 112 . A forward margin of this shoulder 88 is joined to a substantially transparent front window 89 of the frontal segment 182 , whereas a rearward margin of the shoulder 88 is joined to the rearwardly-disposed truncated conical portion of the brew basket which includes mesh-type filter elements or segments 78 through which brewed coffee may flow outwardly and drain downwardly into the underlying coffee pot 20 as previously shown and described in FIGS. 1-11. The U-shaped shoulder 88 of the forwardly protruding frontal segment 182 defines a relatively small, downwardly open pocket 90 . This pocket 90 is positioned, and has a size and shape, for sliding reception of the upstanding light 84 , when the brew basket 112 is mounted within the brew cavity 32 . As viewed in FIG. 20 in accordance with a preferred construction, this pocket 90 is spaced rearwardly at least a short distance from an inboard side of the transparent window 89 , thereby defining a chamber 91 therebetween, so that a portion of the water-borne coffee grounds may flow or circulate through this chamber 91 , i.e., between the window 89 and the light-containing pocket 90 . In this position, when energized, the light 84 illuminates or back-lights the transparent window 89 thereby also illuminating and back-lighting the portion of the water-borne coffee grounds circulating between the light and the window to render the brewing process externally visible. When a non-frosted light 84 is used, the region of the basket defining the pocket 90 is preferably frosted for improved and relatively even light distribution. As previously noted, this brew process includes multiple water jets oriented for turbulently stirring the coffee grounds during the brew cycle, for purposes of achieving improved extraction of coffee flavor. When the brew cycle is initiated as by depression of the on-off button 22 , a control circuit 23 (FIG. 12) energizes the light 84 . Upon completion of the brew cycle, as indicated by a cessation of jetted water inflow to the brew basket 112 , the control circuit 23 may be adapted to turn the light 84 off thereby indicating brew cycle completion. FIG. 21 shows a further alternative preferred form of the invention, wherein components identical to those shown and described in FIGS. 12-20 are referred by common reference numerals, and further wherein modified but otherwise functionally similar components are referred to by reference numerals increased by 100 . As shown, a light 84 is carried on the lower end of a post 92 depending from a modified hinged cap 277 for closing the brew basket cavity 32 during a brew cycle. The light 84 in FIG. 21 is suitable coupled to the control circuit 23 for on-off regulation in the same manner as previously shown and described with respect to FIGS. 12-20. In particular, during a brew cycle, the light 84 in FIG. 21 is spaced rearwardly from an inboard side of the transparent front window 89 on the brew basket 112 , thereby permitting at least some of the water-borne coffee grounds to circulate between the light 84 and the window 89 during brewing. Such circulating grounds are thus back-lighted for easy external viewing. The light 84 may be frosted, or otherwise positioned within a frosted pocket defined at a distal end of the post 92 . FIG. 22 is a schematic diagram showing the coffee brewer of FIGS. 12-21 in association with the control circuit 23 . As shown, water from the reservoir 30 flows through the pair of check valves 45 and 60 disposed at opposite sides of the heating unit 34 for supply as hot water jets into the interior of the brew basket 110 as previously shown and described. Such water flow is initiated upon depression of a suitable on-off switch or button 22 adapted to couple electrical power to the heating unit 34 , and also through a light control circuit 94 to the light 84 . Illumination of the light 84 can be responsive to a suitable sensor 96 such as temperature sensor for detecting the presence of hot water flow from the second check valve 60 and through the conduit 58 to the brew basket. Suitable sensor forms may include a thermistor, or a bimetal thermal sensor, or the like. When heater water flow is initiated and detected by the sensor 96 , the light 84 is illuminated by the light control circuit 94 . When the brew cycle is complete, and hot water flow past the sensor 96 thus stops, the sensor will detect a reduced temperature and thereupon signal the light control circuit 94 to extinguish the light 84 thus providing a visible indication that the brew process has been finished. In a further alternative form as viewed in FIG. 23, a modified sensor 196 may be provided in the form of a float element 97 carrying a magnet 98 or the like in close proximity with a magnetic reed switch 296 coupled to the light control circuit 94 . In this embodiment, upon initiation of hot water flow to the brew basket 110 , the float element 97 is carried upwardly along the flow conduit 58 thereby displacing the magnet 98 relative to the reed switch 296 resulting in switch movement indicative of said hot water flow. The reed switch 296 thus signals the light control circuit 94 which responds by energizing the light 84 . Subsequently, when the hot water flow ceases, the float element descends within the conduit for reversing the state of the reed switch 296 , which thereupon signals the light control circuit 94 to de-energize the light 84 . Suitable stops 101 and 103 may be provided along the conduit for defining end limits of float movement therein. A variety of further modifications and improvements in and to the coffee brewer of the present invention will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art. Accordingly, no limitation on the invention is intended by way of the foregoing description and accompanying drawings, except as set forth in the appended claims.","7340991"

No. 15/482,121, which was filed on 7 Apr. 2017, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/320,101, filed on 8 Apr. 2016. The entire disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Technical Field Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods for brewing coffee. Discussion of Art Coffee can be consumed as a hot or cold beverage. In order to produce cold coffee (e.g., coffee that is cooled below room temperature, such as to a temperature that is no greater than 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a variety of known techniques may be used. A cold brewing technique involves grinding coffee beans and placing the ground coffee beans into cold or room temperature water for a prolonged period of time. Typically, the coffee grounds are placed into the water for twelve hours or more. The coffee grounds are filtered out of the water and coffee that is either cool or at room temperature is produced. Because of the prolonged time needed for brewing the coffee using this technique, however, cold brewing may not be suitable for many applications. Additionally, because coffee beans include components such as caffeine, oils, and fatty acids that are more soluble at elevated temperatures but less soluble or insoluble at the temperatures at which the coffee is brewed using the cold brewing technique, the flavor profile of coffee produced using the cold brewing technique may not be desirable to many consumers. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then add ice to the hot coffee to cool the coffee to a lower temperature. This technique results in the coffee becoming diluted, which may not be desired by many consumers. Additionally, control over the flavor profile of the coffee can be difficult due to the inability to accurately control the amount of dilution of the coffee on a repeated basis. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then cool the coffee, such as by placing the coffee in a refrigerated container. One problem with this technique is that the time required to cool the coffee can be considerable. The longer the time period needed to cool the coffee, the more the coffee may oxidize. The oxidized coffee can provide a taste that is undesirable to many consumers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The subject matter described herein will be better understood from reading the following description of non-limiting embodiments, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein below: FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system for producing cold coffee; and FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for brewing cold coffee. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system 100 for producing cold coffee. The brewing system 100 is used to generate cold coffee within a relatively short time period without diluting the coffee or allowing the coffee to oxidize. As a result, the end product is cooled coffee produced in a short period of time and having a flavor profile that is the same as or closer to hot coffee than cold coffee brewed by other techniques. In one embodiment, the brewing system 100 can generate a large amount of cold coffee within a short time period, such as at least 35 gallons of cold coffee, at least 75 gallons of cold coffee, up to 150 gallons of cold coffee, up to 1,500 gallons of cold coffee, or another amount, within twenty minutes (or another period of time). Optionally (and as described below), the brewing system 100 may add a gas to the cold coffee, such as nitrogen, after brewing. The brewing system 100 includes a brewing tank 102 , such as a lauter tun or other container, that holds a filter body 104 . The brewing tank 102 forms an enclosure in which heated water is mixed with coffee grounds to brew hot coffee. In one embodiment, water is preheated in another tank and transferred to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, the water may be heated in the brewing tank 102 . For example, the brewing tank 102 may include one or more heating elements, or bodies that become heated and thereby heat the water in the tank 102 . The water may be heated to an elevated temperature suitable for brewing coffee. In one embodiment, the water is heated to a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit (or 93.3 degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the water may be heated to a temperature of 198 to 202 degrees Fahrenheit (or 92.2 to 94.4 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 198 and 202 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (or 90.6 to 96.1 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 190 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (or 87.8 to 98.9 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 190 and 210 degrees Fahrenheit. Optionally, another elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature) may be used. Some, but not all, of the heated water used for brewing coffee using the system 100 during the brewing of a single batch of coffee may be mixed with coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 . The amount of heated water that is equivalent to one third of the total amount of water used to brew coffee in a single batch may be added to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water may be added to the brewing tank 102 . For example, if seventy-five gallons of water are to be used in brewing coffee during a single batch, then twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water can be in the tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water can be added to the tank 102 , such as fifty gallons (or 190 liters) of water (e.g., when 150 gallons or 570 liters of water are used to brew coffee), 500 gallons (or 1900 liters) of water (e.g., when 1500 gallons or 5700 liters of water are used to brew coffee), or another amount can be added to the tank 102 . The coffee grounds may be relatively large size. For example, coffee beans may be ground such that, when the coffee grounds are passed through a ROTAP device, 69-75% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #20 and #30 sieves, 25-28% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #12 and #16 sieves, and 10-14% of the coffee grounds pass through a US Standard Size #30 sieve and into a pan or other collection device. Alternatively, the coffee grounds may be a smaller size. Coffee grounds are introduced into the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to begin brewing hot coffee. In one embodiment, sixty pounds (or twenty-seven kilograms) of ground coffee beans are mixed into twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water in the tank 102 . Alternatively, a greater or lesser amount of coffee grounds may be mixed with a greater or lesser amount of heated water. The amount of coffee grounds may be based on the amount of coffee to be brewed. For example, the amount of coffee grounds may increase with larger batches of coffee being brewed, and can decrease with smaller batches of coffee being brewed. The ratio of weight of heated water to coffee grounds used to brew the coffee may be a 10:1 ratio (e.g., seventy-five gallons of heated water and sixty pounds of ground coffee) in one embodiment. Alternatively, another ratio of heated water to may be used. For example, a ratio of at least 12:1 to no more than 8:1 may be used, a ratio of at least 11:1 to no more than 9:1 may be used, or another ratio may be used. The coffee grounds are agitated in the heated water in the tank 102 in one embodiment. This agitation may be performed manually, such as by an operator of the system 100 moving a paddle or other object in the tank 102 to agitate the coffee grounds. Alternatively, the agitation may be performed automatically or by machine implementation, such as by one or more motors moving one or more paddles within the tank 102 . Additional heated water is added to the tank 102 in one embodiment. The remaining amount of water used to brew the batch of coffee may be added. For example, if the amount of heated water that equals one third of the total amount of water to be used in brewing coffee is already in the tank 102 , then an amount of heated water that equals two thirds of the total amount of water to be used in brewing the coffee can be added to the tank 102 . Agitation of the coffee grounds in the water in the tank 102 can occur while the remaining heated water is introduced into the tank 102 . The coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a brewing time. This brewing time can vary to achieve different flavors of coffee, can vary based on the amount of coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 , and/or can vary based on the amount of heated water in the brewing tank 102 . In one embodiment, the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a time period of at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty minutes. Alternatively, a shorter or longer time period may be used. This time period may be referred to as a contact time. Once the brewing time is complete, a drain valve 106 opens. The drain valve 106 controls flow of the coffee brewed in the tank 102 (referred to as hot coffee or hot brewed coffee) through one or more conduits 108 in the system 100 . A first portion of the conduits 108 fluidly couples the brewing tank 102 with a filter 110 . Responsive to opening the drain valve 106 , the hot brewed coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 and flows through the first portion of the conduits 108 to the filter 110 . The filter 110 may be referred to as an in-line filter. The hot brewed coffee can flow through the filter body 104 , where at least some of the coffee grounds introduced into the brewing tank 102 are filtered or otherwise removed from the hot brewed coffee. The filter body 104 may be a metal filter or another type of filter. The coffee passing through the filter body 104 may include some additional coffee grounds, which are removed from the hot brewed coffee by the filter 110 . The hot brewed coffee flows through the filter 110 to remove remaining coffee grounds. The filter 110 may be a centrifugal filter or another type of filter. In one embodiment, the filter 110 is a twenty inch (or fifty-one centimeter) inline filter with a metal wedge wire micron 127 filter. Alternatively, another type of filter may be used. A pump 112 generates a suction force in the conduits 108 to draw the hot brewed coffee through the conduits 108 . The pump 112 can pull on the hot brewed coffee flowing out of the brewing tank 102 and through the filter 110 . The coffee exiting the filter 110 can be referred to as filtered coffee. The pump 112 can direct the filtered coffee (which may remain at an elevated temperature, such as the temperature at which the coffee was brewed or slightly less, such as five to ten degrees Fahrenheit less) through a second portion of the conduits 108 to a heat exchanger 114 . With the storage tank 102 and the pump 112 , a unique coffee brewing process is provided by the system 100 . This brewing process includes a first stage, immersion type of coffee brewing, where the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 (e.g., with the drain valve 106 remaining closed) for a first designated period of time. This first designated period of time may be approximately six minutes in one embodiment. Alternatively, a different period of time may be used, such as between five and seven minutes. The brewing process includes a subsequent, second stage of pressure assisted drip type of coffee brewing. This stage involves the coffee dripping out of a bed of coffee grounds formed on the filter body 104 in the storage tank 102 into the first portion of the conduits 108 . The coffee may be drawn through this bed of coffee grounds by the pressure or suction generated by the pump 112 . This second stage of the brewing process can last for a different, second designated period of time. This second designated period of time may be approximately nine to fourteen minutes. For example, the second designated period of time may be at least nine minutes and no more than fourteen minutes. Alternatively, the second designated period of time may be different, such as at least eight minutes and no more than fifteen minutes, at least seven minutes and no more than sixteen minutes, or another period of time. The heat exchanger 114 cools the filtered coffee to a designated reduced temperature. The heat exchanger 114 can be a plate-style heat exchanger that pumps water, glycol, or other fluids in channels that are separate from, but thermally coupled with, channels in the heat exchanger 114 through which the filtered coffee flows due to the pressure generated by the pump 112 . This allows the heat exchanger 114 to cool the hot and filtered coffee without diluting the coffee or changing the chemical constituents of the coffee. The heat exchanger 114 rapidly cools the filtered coffee in one embodiment. For example, the temperature of the filtered coffee may decrease by at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (or seventy-one degrees Celsius), by at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit (or sixty-six degrees Celsius), by at least 125 degrees Fahrenheit (or fifty-two degrees Celsius), by at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or thirty-eight degrees Celsius), or by another amount. In one embodiment, the filtered coffee is cooled during flow of the filtered coffee through the heat exchanger 114 to a temperature of forty degrees Fahrenheit (or four degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the filtered coffee may be cooled to another temperature, such as between thirty-eight and forty-two degrees Fahrenheit or three to six degrees Celsius, inclusive; between thirty-six and forty-four degrees Fahrenheit or two to seven degrees Celsius, inclusive; or another temperature. The filtered coffee is cooled rapidly and faster than the coffee would be cooled by storing the filtered coffee in a standard home refrigerator overnight or by pouring the coffee over ice. For example, filtered coffee may be cooled to the designated temperature in less than twenty minutes, less than fifteen minutes, less than ten minutes, or less than five minutes, depending on the heat exchanger 114 (e.g., the size of the heat exchanger 114 ). Keeping the total time for producing the cooled coffee relatively short can reduce the total contact time of the water and coffee with the coffee grounds. Allowing the water and coffee to remain in contact with the coffee grounds for longer time periods can significantly deteriorate the taste of the end result coffee, such as by producing a more bitter coffee than is achieved by shorter contact times between the coffee grounds and the water or coffee. Additionally, once the filtered coffee leaves the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may provide a sealed environment that does not expose the coffee to the ambient environment and/or oxygen until after the coffee is removed from the system 100 . This also can assist in producing a coffee having an improved flavor profile relative to coffee that is exposed to the ambient environment and/or oxygen during cooling or storage. The filtered coffee may be cooled without freezing or partially freezing the coffee, so that the cooled coffee exiting the heat exchanger 114 can continue to flow through a third portion of the conduits 108 to a storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the storage tank 116 can be referred to as a brite tank or bright tank. The cooled coffee is directed into the storage tank 116 by the pressure generated by the pump 112 . The time period between placing the coffee grounds into contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to placing or directing the cooled and filtered coffee into the storage tank 116 may be relatively short, such as twenty minutes or less, thirty minutes or less, or another amount of time. This short time period for brewing, filtering, and rapidly cooling the hot coffee may be used for large volumes of coffee, such as seventy-five gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, etc. The cold coffee may be brewed hot, filtered, and then cooled while not diluting the coffee or having the coffee stored in an environment that causes oxidation of the coffee for an extended period of time (e.g., more than twelve hours). Subsequent to the immersion brewing process in the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may reduce or prevent contact between the coffee and one or more constituents in the ambient environment (e.g., oxygen) by sealing the components of the system 100 from the external environment, as described above. This can assist in preventing the coffee from oxidizing or otherwise being chemically altered during the process described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the storage tank 116 is fluidly coupled with a gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can represent a tank of pressurized gas or a machine that generates the gas at an elevated pressure. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can store a gas that is introduced into the storage tank 116 to be mixed with the cooled coffee. For example, the gas source 118 may include nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas is held in the gas source 118 at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch (or at least 3.1 bar). A valve 120 is closed to prevent the gas in the gas source 118 from flowing into the storage tank 116 and is opened to allow the gas in the gas source 118 to flow into the storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the valve 120 is open prior to the coffee being introduced into the storage tank 116 in order to introduce the gas in the tank 116 . The storage tank 116 may be purged with the gas prior to transferring coffee into the tank 116 to achieve no less than 100 parts per billion of dissolved oxygen in the tank 116 at a pressure (or absence of pressure) of zero pounds per square inch. The gas can be introduced into the tank 116 at a pressure of at least fourteen pounds per square inch, at least 14.5 pounds per square inch, at least fifteen pounds per square inch, or another pressure. This introduction of the gas prior to entry of the coffee into the tank 116 can charge (or at least partially fill) the tank 116 with the gas and purge oxygen from the tank 116 . The gas and cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 together in order to mix the gas with the cooled coffee. For example, nitrogen may be mixed in with the cooled coffee. Once the coffee is in the tank 116 , the pressure of the gas is supplied into the storage tank 116 can be increased to an elevated pressure, such as at least forty-five pounds per square inch, in one embodiment. Alternatively, the gas can be supplied into the storage tank 116 at another pressure, such as at least fifty-five pounds per square inch, at least thirty pounds per square inch, and/or up to sixth pounds per square inch, or another pressure. The gas may be supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least a designated period of time. Exposure of the coffee to the gas for such as extended period of time can assist in the coffee absorbing at least some of the gas while in the tank 116 . In one embodiment, the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least twenty-four hours. Another time period alternatively may be used. In one embodiment, a carbonating or carbonation stone is placed inside the storage tank 116 while the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 . The carbonating or carbonation stone may be added to the storage tank 116 to decrease the time that the cooled coffee is held in the storage tank 116 before serving at least some of the cooled coffee to one or more consumers. For example, without the carbonating or carbonation stone, the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for twenty-four hours while the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for four hours. In the illustrated embodiment, the system 100 includes a controller 122 that operates to control various components of the system 100 . The controller 122 represents hardware circuitry that includes and/or is electrically connected with one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits, or other electronic logic-based devices). The controller 122 is communicatively coupled with various components of the system 100 to allow the controller 122 to generate and communicate control signals that direct the components to implement various actions. For example, the controller 122 can be coupled with the drain valve 106 , the pump 112 , the heat exchanger 114 , and/or the valve 120 by one or more wired and/or wireless connections over or through which the controller 122 can transmit and/or broadcast control signals to control operations of these components. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the controller 122 , or may include several controllers 122 that separately control operations of different components of the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the drain valve 106 to change a state of the drain valve 106 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the drain valve 106 (or a motor or other device coupled with the drain valve 106 ) to open the drain valve 106 or to close the drain valve 106 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the drain valve 106 is open or closed. The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the pump 112 to activate or deactivate the pump 112 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the pump 112 (or a motor or other device of the pump 112 ) to turn on the pump 112 and cause the pump 112 to begin generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 or to turn the pump 112 off and stop the pump 112 from generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the heat exchanger 114 to activate or deactivate the heat exchanger 114 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the heat exchanger (or a motor or other device of the heat exchanger 114 ) to turn on the heat exchanger 114 and cause the heat exchanger 114 to begin cooling the coffee or to turn the heat exchanger 114 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the valve 120 to change a state of the valve 120 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the valve 120 (or a motor or other device coupled with the valve 120 ) to open the valve 120 or to close the valve 120 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the valve 120 is open or closed to control the flow of gas in the gas source 118 into the storage tank 116 . FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 200 for brewing cold coffee. The method 200 can be performed by the system 100 described herein to brew cold coffee in large amounts within a short time period without diluting the coffee or changing flavor of the hot coffee that is initially brewed (e.g., through oxidation). Optionally, the method 200 can represent an algorithm that is a software program or that is used to program one or more of the components of the system 100 to brew the cold coffee. At 202 , water is heated to an elevated temperature. As one example, the water can be heated to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit, as described above. The water can be heated in the brewing tank 102 or in another location. At 204 , a portion (and less than all) of the heated water is placed into the brewing tank. For example, one third of the total water used to brew a single batch of coffee (e.g., the 75 gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, or other amount) may be adding to the brewing tank 102 . At 206 , coffee grounds are added to the heated water in the brewing tank 102 . At 208 , the remainder of the heated water is added to the brewing tank 102 . During and/or after addition of the coffee grounds and water to the brewing tank 102 , the mixture of the coffee grounds and the water may be agitated, as described above. At 210 , hot coffee is brewed in the brewing tank 102 using immersion brewing. During this brewing, the water and coffee grounds remain in the brewing tank 102 so that the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water. At 212 , a determination is made as to whether the immersion brewing of the coffee in the brewing tank 102 is complete. If the immersion brewing is complete (e.g., the coffee grounds have been in contact with the heated water for a designated time period, as described above), then flow of the method 200 can proceed toward 214 . Otherwise, flow of the method 200 can return toward 210 so that immersion brewing can continue until complete. At 214 , a drain valve is opened in order to drain the hot coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The coffee drained from the brewing tank 102 is heated. For example, the coffee may be at an elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature, above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, above 150 degrees Fahrenheit to 205 degrees Fahrenheit, or another range of acceptable brewing temperatures) as the coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 . At 216 , a pump is activated to force the heated coffee through one or more conduits. The pump may be activated to being pressure assisted drip brewing of the coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The pump may be activated at the same time that the drain valve is opened, after the drain valve is opened, or prior to opening the drain valve in different embodiments. At 218 , the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 is filtered using multiple stage filters. For example, the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 may be drained from the brewing tank 102 through the filter body 104 in the brewing tank 102 and then filtered again using the inline filter 110 . Alternatively, the hot coffee may be filtered using more than two filters or using a single filter. At 220 , the coffee is rapidly cooled. The coffee can be cooled after the coffee has been filtered, as described above. Alternatively, the coffee can be cooled prior to filtering the coffee or between filters of a multi-stage filtering process. The coffee may be cooled within a relatively short time period without diluting or chemically altering the coffee, in contrast to cooling techniques involving mixing the coffee with ice, allowing the coffee to slowly cool (thereby resulting in oxidation), etc. The coffee can be cooled by flowing the coffee through one or more heat exchangers. At 222 , the cooled and filtered coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The coffee can be stored in the storage tank 116 for at least a designated time period (e.g., twenty-four hours), or may be immediately available for consumption following completion of the brewing of the batch of coffee (where the batch is completed when the water mixed with the coffee in the brewing tank 102 has reached the storage tank 116 ). The storage tank 116 may be sealed to reduce or eliminate contact between the coffee and the external environment to reduce or eliminate oxidation or other chemical changes to the coffee. As described above, the tank 116 may be purged with the gas (e.g., nitrogen) to remove oxygen from the tank 116 , the coffee may then be introduced into the tank 116 , and the pressure of the gas can be increased to the head pressure to cause the gas to be absorbed in the coffee in the tank 116 . At 224 , the coffee optionally may be mixed with a gas. For example, nitrogen can be directed into the storage tank 116 to mix with the coffee while the coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The mixture of coffee and the gas can provide a pleasant or desired taste to at least some consumers. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes adding a first portion of a total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to a brewing tank, subsequently adding the coffee grounds to the brewing tank, and adding a remaining portion of the total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee, filtering the hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee produces a batch amount of cooled coffee, where the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least seventy-five gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 150 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 1,500 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a ratio of ten to one of the hot water to the coffee grounds by weight. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes a multiple stage brewing process that includes an immersion brewing stage of the hot coffee and a pressure assisted drip brewing stage of the hot coffee. In one example, the pressure assisted drip brewing stage occurs over a longer time period than the immersion brewing stage. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water in a brewing tank, and wherein filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes additionally passing the hot coffee through an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes agitating a mixture of the coffee grounds and the hot water. In one example, the method also includes mixing the cooled coffee with nitrogen gas. In one example, the nitrogen gas is mixed with the cooled coffee at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas for at least twenty-four hours. In one example, mixing the cooled coffee with the nitrogen gas occurs in presence of a carbonating stone. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas in the presence of the carbonating stone for no more than six hours. In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, the brewing tank is a Lauter tun. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least seventy-five gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 150 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the brewing tank is configured to hold at least 1,500 gallons of the hot water. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, the heat exchanger is configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes.

BACKGROUND Technical Field Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to systems and methods for brewing coffee. Discussion of Art Coffee can be consumed as a hot or cold beverage. In order to produce cold coffee (e.g., coffee that is cooled below room temperature, such as to a temperature that is no greater than 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a variety of known techniques may be used. A cold brewing technique involves grinding coffee beans and placing the ground coffee beans into cold or room temperature water for a prolonged period of time. Typically, the coffee grounds are placed into the water for twelve hours or more. The coffee grounds are filtered out of the water and coffee that is either cool or at room temperature is produced. Because of the prolonged time needed for brewing the coffee using this technique, however, cold brewing may not be suitable for many applications. Additionally, because coffee beans include components such as caffeine, oils, and fatty acids that are more soluble at elevated temperatures but less soluble or insoluble at the temperatures at which the coffee is brewed using the cold brewing technique, the flavor profile of coffee produced using the cold brewing technique may not be desirable to many consumers. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then add ice to the hot coffee to cool the coffee to a lower temperature. This technique results in the coffee becoming diluted, which may not be desired by many consumers. Additionally, control over the flavor profile of the coffee can be difficult due to the inability to accurately control the amount of dilution of the coffee on a repeated basis. Another technique for producing cold coffee is to brew hot coffee and then cool the coffee, such as by placing the coffee in a refrigerated container. One problem with this technique is that the time required to cool the coffee can be considerable. The longer the time period needed to cool the coffee, the more the coffee may oxidize. The oxidized coffee can provide a taste that is undesirable to many consumers. BRIEF DESCRIPTION In one embodiment, a system (e.g., a brewing system) includes a brewing tank configured to receive coffee grounds and hot water (where the coffee grounds are mixed with the hot water at an elevated temperature to brew hot coffee, one or more filters configured to filter the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and a heat exchanger configured to rapidly cool the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one embodiment, a method includes brewing hot coffee by mixing coffee grounds with water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit, filtering the hot coffee through multiple filters to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and cooling the filtered hot coffee from the temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period no longer than twenty minutes to form cooled coffee. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The subject matter described herein will be better understood from reading the following description of non-limiting embodiments, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein below: FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system for producing cold coffee; and FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method for brewing cold coffee. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 one embodiment of a brewing system 100 for producing cold coffee. The brewing system 100 is used to generate cold coffee within a relatively short time period without diluting the coffee or allowing the coffee to oxidize. As a result, the end product is cooled coffee produced in a short period of time and having a flavor profile that is the same as or closer to hot coffee than cold coffee brewed by other techniques. In one embodiment, the brewing system 100 can generate a large amount of cold coffee within a short time period, such as at least 35 gallons of cold coffee, at least 75 gallons of cold coffee, up to 150 gallons of cold coffee, up to 1,500 gallons of cold coffee, or another amount, within twenty minutes (or another period of time). Optionally (and as described below), the brewing system 100 may add a gas to the cold coffee, such as nitrogen, after brewing. The brewing system 100 includes a brewing tank 102 , such as a lauter tun or other container, that holds a filter body 104 . The brewing tank 102 forms an enclosure in which heated water is mixed with coffee grounds to brew hot coffee. In one embodiment, water is preheated in another tank and transferred to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, the water may be heated in the brewing tank 102 . For example, the brewing tank 102 may include one or more heating elements, or bodies that become heated and thereby heat the water in the tank 102 . The water may be heated to an elevated temperature suitable for brewing coffee. In one embodiment, the water is heated to a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit (or 93.3 degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the water may be heated to a temperature of 198 to 202 degrees Fahrenheit (or 92.2 to 94.4 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 198 and 202 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit (or 90.6 to 96.1 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In another embodiment, the water may be heated to a temperature between 190 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (or 87.8 to 98.9 degrees Celsius), inclusive of 190 and 210 degrees Fahrenheit. Optionally, another elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature) may be used. Some, but not all, of the heated water used for brewing coffee using the system 100 during the brewing of a single batch of coffee may be mixed with coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 . The amount of heated water that is equivalent to one third of the total amount of water used to brew coffee in a single batch may be added to the brewing tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water may be added to the brewing tank 102 . For example, if seventy-five gallons of water are to be used in brewing coffee during a single batch, then twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water can be in the tank 102 . Alternatively, another amount of heated water can be added to the tank 102 , such as fifty gallons (or 190 liters) of water (e.g., when 150 gallons or 570 liters of water are used to brew coffee), 500 gallons (or 1900 liters) of water (e.g., when 1500 gallons or 5700 liters of water are used to brew coffee), or another amount can be added to the tank 102 . The coffee grounds may be relatively large size. For example, coffee beans may be ground such that, when the coffee grounds are passed through a ROTAP device, 69-75% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #20 and #30 sieves, 25-28% of the coffee grounds are collected in US Standard Size #12 and #16 sieves, and 10-14% of the coffee grounds pass through a US Standard Size #30 sieve and into a pan or other collection device. Alternatively, the coffee grounds may be a smaller size. Coffee grounds are introduced into the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to begin brewing hot coffee. In one embodiment, sixty pounds (or twenty-seven kilograms) of ground coffee beans are mixed into twenty-five gallons (or ninety-five liters) of heated water in the tank 102 . Alternatively, a greater or lesser amount of coffee grounds may be mixed with a greater or lesser amount of heated water. The amount of coffee grounds may be based on the amount of coffee to be brewed. For example, the amount of coffee grounds may increase with larger batches of coffee being brewed, and can decrease with smaller batches of coffee being brewed. The ratio of weight of heated water to coffee grounds used to brew the coffee may be a 10:1 ratio (e.g., seventy-five gallons of heated water and sixty pounds of ground coffee) in one embodiment. Alternatively, another ratio of heated water to may be used. For example, a ratio of at least 12:1 to no more than 8:1 may be used, a ratio of at least 11:1 to no more than 9:1 may be used, or another ratio may be used. The coffee grounds are agitated in the heated water in the tank 102 in one embodiment. This agitation may be performed manually, such as by an operator of the system 100 moving a paddle or other object in the tank 102 to agitate the coffee grounds. Alternatively, the agitation may be performed automatically or by machine implementation, such as by one or more motors moving one or more paddles within the tank 102 . Additional heated water is added to the tank 102 in one embodiment. The remaining amount of water used to brew the batch of coffee may be added. For example, if the amount of heated water that equals one third of the total amount of water to be used in brewing coffee is already in the tank 102 , then an amount of heated water that equals two thirds of the total amount of water to be used in brewing the coffee can be added to the tank 102 . Agitation of the coffee grounds in the water in the tank 102 can occur while the remaining heated water is introduced into the tank 102 . The coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a brewing time. This brewing time can vary to achieve different flavors of coffee, can vary based on the amount of coffee grounds in the brewing tank 102 , and/or can vary based on the amount of heated water in the brewing tank 102 . In one embodiment, the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 for a time period of at least fifteen minutes and no more than twenty minutes. Alternatively, a shorter or longer time period may be used. This time period may be referred to as a contact time. Once the brewing time is complete, a drain valve 106 opens. The drain valve 106 controls flow of the coffee brewed in the tank 102 (referred to as hot coffee or hot brewed coffee) through one or more conduits 108 in the system 100 . A first portion of the conduits 108 fluidly couples the brewing tank 102 with a filter 110 . Responsive to opening the drain valve 106 , the hot brewed coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 and flows through the first portion of the conduits 108 to the filter 110 . The filter 110 may be referred to as an in-line filter. The hot brewed coffee can flow through the filter body 104 , where at least some of the coffee grounds introduced into the brewing tank 102 are filtered or otherwise removed from the hot brewed coffee. The filter body 104 may be a metal filter or another type of filter. The coffee passing through the filter body 104 may include some additional coffee grounds, which are removed from the hot brewed coffee by the filter 110 . The hot brewed coffee flows through the filter 110 to remove remaining coffee grounds. The filter 110 may be a centrifugal filter or another type of filter. In one embodiment, the filter 110 is a twenty inch (or fifty-one centimeter) inline filter with a metal wedge wire micron 127 filter. Alternatively, another type of filter may be used. A pump 112 generates a suction force in the conduits 108 to draw the hot brewed coffee through the conduits 108 . The pump 112 can pull on the hot brewed coffee flowing out of the brewing tank 102 and through the filter 110 . The coffee exiting the filter 110 can be referred to as filtered coffee. The pump 112 can direct the filtered coffee (which may remain at an elevated temperature, such as the temperature at which the coffee was brewed or slightly less, such as five to ten degrees Fahrenheit less) through a second portion of the conduits 108 to a heat exchanger 114 . With the storage tank 102 and the pump 112 , a unique coffee brewing process is provided by the system 100 . This brewing process includes a first stage, immersion type of coffee brewing, where the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 (e.g., with the drain valve 106 remaining closed) for a first designated period of time. This first designated period of time may be approximately six minutes in one embodiment. Alternatively, a different period of time may be used, such as between five and seven minutes. The brewing process includes a subsequent, second stage of pressure assisted drip type of coffee brewing. This stage involves the coffee dripping out of a bed of coffee grounds formed on the filter body 104 in the storage tank 102 into the first portion of the conduits 108 . The coffee may be drawn through this bed of coffee grounds by the pressure or suction generated by the pump 112 . This second stage of the brewing process can last for a different, second designated period of time. This second designated period of time may be approximately nine to fourteen minutes. For example, the second designated period of time may be at least nine minutes and no more than fourteen minutes. Alternatively, the second designated period of time may be different, such as at least eight minutes and no more than fifteen minutes, at least seven minutes and no more than sixteen minutes, or another period of time. The heat exchanger 114 cools the filtered coffee to a designated reduced temperature. The heat exchanger 114 can be a plate-style heat exchanger that pumps water, glycol, or other fluids in channels that are separate from, but thermally coupled with, channels in the heat exchanger 114 through which the filtered coffee flows due to the pressure generated by the pump 112 . This allows the heat exchanger 114 to cool the hot and filtered coffee without diluting the coffee or changing the chemical constituents of the coffee. The heat exchanger 114 rapidly cools the filtered coffee in one embodiment. For example, the temperature of the filtered coffee may decrease by at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (or seventy-one degrees Celsius), by at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit (or sixty-six degrees Celsius), by at least 125 degrees Fahrenheit (or fifty-two degrees Celsius), by at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (or thirty-eight degrees Celsius), or by another amount. In one embodiment, the filtered coffee is cooled during flow of the filtered coffee through the heat exchanger 114 to a temperature of forty degrees Fahrenheit (or four degrees Celsius). Alternatively, the filtered coffee may be cooled to another temperature, such as between thirty-eight and forty-two degrees Fahrenheit or three to six degrees Celsius, inclusive; between thirty-six and forty-four degrees Fahrenheit or two to seven degrees Celsius, inclusive; or another temperature. The filtered coffee is cooled rapidly and faster than the coffee would be cooled by storing the filtered coffee in a standard home refrigerator overnight or by pouring the coffee over ice. For example, filtered coffee may be cooled to the designated temperature in less than twenty minutes, less than fifteen minutes, less than ten minutes, or less than five minutes, depending on the heat exchanger 114 (e.g., the size of the heat exchanger 114 ). Keeping the total time for producing the cooled coffee relatively short can reduce the total contact time of the water and coffee with the coffee grounds. Allowing the water and coffee to remain in contact with the coffee grounds for longer time periods can significantly deteriorate the taste of the end result coffee, such as by producing a more bitter coffee than is achieved by shorter contact times between the coffee grounds and the water or coffee. Additionally, once the filtered coffee leaves the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may provide a sealed environment that does not expose the coffee to the ambient environment and/or oxygen until after the coffee is removed from the system 100 . This also can assist in producing a coffee having an improved flavor profile relative to coffee that is exposed to the ambient environment and/or oxygen during cooling or storage. The filtered coffee may be cooled without freezing or partially freezing the coffee, so that the cooled coffee exiting the heat exchanger 114 can continue to flow through a third portion of the conduits 108 to a storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the storage tank 116 can be referred to as a brite tank or bright tank. The cooled coffee is directed into the storage tank 116 by the pressure generated by the pump 112 . The time period between placing the coffee grounds into contact with the heated water in the brewing tank 102 to placing or directing the cooled and filtered coffee into the storage tank 116 may be relatively short, such as twenty minutes or less, thirty minutes or less, or another amount of time. This short time period for brewing, filtering, and rapidly cooling the hot coffee may be used for large volumes of coffee, such as seventy-five gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, etc. The cold coffee may be brewed hot, filtered, and then cooled while not diluting the coffee or having the coffee stored in an environment that causes oxidation of the coffee for an extended period of time (e.g., more than twelve hours). Subsequent to the immersion brewing process in the brewing tank 102 , the system 100 may reduce or prevent contact between the coffee and one or more constituents in the ambient environment (e.g., oxygen) by sealing the components of the system 100 from the external environment, as described above. This can assist in preventing the coffee from oxidizing or otherwise being chemically altered during the process described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the storage tank 116 is fluidly coupled with a gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can represent a tank of pressurized gas or a machine that generates the gas at an elevated pressure. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the gas source 118 . The gas source 118 can store a gas that is introduced into the storage tank 116 to be mixed with the cooled coffee. For example, the gas source 118 may include nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas is held in the gas source 118 at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch (or at least 3.1 bar). A valve 120 is closed to prevent the gas in the gas source 118 from flowing into the storage tank 116 and is opened to allow the gas in the gas source 118 to flow into the storage tank 116 . In one embodiment, the valve 120 is open prior to the coffee being introduced into the storage tank 116 in order to introduce the gas in the tank 116 . The storage tank 116 may be purged with the gas prior to transferring coffee into the tank 116 to achieve no less than 100 parts per billion of dissolved oxygen in the tank 116 at a pressure (or absence of pressure) of zero pounds per square inch. The gas can be introduced into the tank 116 at a pressure of at least fourteen pounds per square inch, at least 14.5 pounds per square inch, at least fifteen pounds per square inch, or another pressure. This introduction of the gas prior to entry of the coffee into the tank 116 can charge (or at least partially fill) the tank 116 with the gas and purge oxygen from the tank 116 . The gas and cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 together in order to mix the gas with the cooled coffee. For example, nitrogen may be mixed in with the cooled coffee. Once the coffee is in the tank 116 , the pressure of the gas is supplied into the storage tank 116 can be increased to an elevated pressure, such as at least forty-five pounds per square inch, in one embodiment. Alternatively, the gas can be supplied into the storage tank 116 at another pressure, such as at least fifty-five pounds per square inch, at least thirty pounds per square inch, and/or up to sixth pounds per square inch, or another pressure. The gas may be supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least a designated period of time. Exposure of the coffee to the gas for such as extended period of time can assist in the coffee absorbing at least some of the gas while in the tank 116 . In one embodiment, the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 for at least twenty-four hours. Another time period alternatively may be used. In one embodiment, a carbonating or carbonation stone is placed inside the storage tank 116 while the gas is supplied to the storage tank 116 . The carbonating or carbonation stone may be added to the storage tank 116 to decrease the time that the cooled coffee is held in the storage tank 116 before serving at least some of the cooled coffee to one or more consumers. For example, without the carbonating or carbonation stone, the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for twenty-four hours while the cooled coffee may be in the storage tank 116 for four hours. In the illustrated embodiment, the system 100 includes a controller 122 that operates to control various components of the system 100 . The controller 122 represents hardware circuitry that includes and/or is electrically connected with one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, field programmable gate arrays, integrated circuits, or other electronic logic-based devices). The controller 122 is communicatively coupled with various components of the system 100 to allow the controller 122 to generate and communicate control signals that direct the components to implement various actions. For example, the controller 122 can be coupled with the drain valve 106 , the pump 112 , the heat exchanger 114 , and/or the valve 120 by one or more wired and/or wireless connections over or through which the controller 122 can transmit and/or broadcast control signals to control operations of these components. Alternatively, the system 100 may not include the controller 122 , or may include several controllers 122 that separately control operations of different components of the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the drain valve 106 to change a state of the drain valve 106 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the drain valve 106 (or a motor or other device coupled with the drain valve 106 ) to open the drain valve 106 or to close the drain valve 106 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the drain valve 106 is open or closed. The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the pump 112 to activate or deactivate the pump 112 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the pump 112 (or a motor or other device of the pump 112 ) to turn on the pump 112 and cause the pump 112 to begin generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 or to turn the pump 112 off and stop the pump 112 from generating suction or other forces that move the coffee through the system 100 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the heat exchanger 114 to activate or deactivate the heat exchanger 114 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the heat exchanger (or a motor or other device of the heat exchanger 114 ) to turn on the heat exchanger 114 and cause the heat exchanger 114 to begin cooling the coffee or to turn the heat exchanger 114 . The controller 122 can generate and communicate a control signal to the valve 120 to change a state of the valve 120 . For example, the controller 122 can send the control signal to the valve 120 (or a motor or other device coupled with the valve 120 ) to open the valve 120 or to close the valve 120 . The controller 122 may thereby control when the valve 120 is open or closed to control the flow of gas in the gas source 118 into the storage tank 116 . FIG. 2 illustrates a flowchart of one embodiment of a method 200 for brewing cold coffee. The method 200 can be performed by the system 100 described herein to brew cold coffee in large amounts within a short time period without diluting the coffee or changing flavor of the hot coffee that is initially brewed (e.g., through oxidation). Optionally, the method 200 can represent an algorithm that is a software program or that is used to program one or more of the components of the system 100 to brew the cold coffee. At 202 , water is heated to an elevated temperature. As one example, the water can be heated to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit, as described above. The water can be heated in the brewing tank 102 or in another location. At 204 , a portion (and less than all) of the heated water is placed into the brewing tank. For example, one third of the total water used to brew a single batch of coffee (e.g., the 75 gallons, 150 gallons, 1500 gallons, or other amount) may be adding to the brewing tank 102 . At 206 , coffee grounds are added to the heated water in the brewing tank 102 . At 208 , the remainder of the heated water is added to the brewing tank 102 . During and/or after addition of the coffee grounds and water to the brewing tank 102 , the mixture of the coffee grounds and the water may be agitated, as described above. At 210 , hot coffee is brewed in the brewing tank 102 using immersion brewing. During this brewing, the water and coffee grounds remain in the brewing tank 102 so that the coffee grounds remain in contact with the heated water. At 212 , a determination is made as to whether the immersion brewing of the coffee in the brewing tank 102 is complete. If the immersion brewing is complete (e.g., the coffee grounds have been in contact with the heated water for a designated time period, as described above), then flow of the method 200 can proceed toward 214 . Otherwise, flow of the method 200 can return toward 210 so that immersion brewing can continue until complete. At 214 , a drain valve is opened in order to drain the hot coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The coffee drained from the brewing tank 102 is heated. For example, the coffee may be at an elevated temperature (e.g., above room temperature, above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, above 150 degrees Fahrenheit to 205 degrees Fahrenheit, or another range of acceptable brewing temperatures) as the coffee drains from the brewing tank 102 . At 216 , a pump is activated to force the heated coffee through one or more conduits. The pump may be activated to being pressure assisted drip brewing of the coffee from the brewing tank 102 . The pump may be activated at the same time that the drain valve is opened, after the drain valve is opened, or prior to opening the drain valve in different embodiments. At 218 , the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 is filtered using multiple stage filters. For example, the hot coffee in the brewing tank 102 may be drained from the brewing tank 102 through the filter body 104 in the brewing tank 102 and then filtered again using the inline filter 110 . Alternatively, the hot coffee may be filtered using more than two filters or using a single filter. At 220 , the coffee is rapidly cooled. The coffee can be cooled after the coffee has been filtered, as described above. Alternatively, the coffee can be cooled prior to filtering the coffee or between filters of a multi-stage filtering process. The coffee may be cooled within a relatively short time period without diluting or chemically altering the coffee, in contrast to cooling techniques involving mixing the coffee with ice, allowing the coffee to slowly cool (thereby resulting in oxidation), etc. The coffee can be cooled by flowing the coffee through one or more heat exchangers. At 222 , the cooled and filtered coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The coffee can be stored in the storage tank 116 for at least a designated time period (e.g., twenty-four hours), or may be immediately available for consumption following completion of the brewing of the batch of coffee (where the batch is completed when the water mixed with the coffee in the brewing tank 102 has reached the storage tank 116 ). The storage tank 116 may be sealed to reduce or eliminate contact between the coffee and the external environment to reduce or eliminate oxidation or other chemical changes to the coffee. As described above, the tank 116 may be purged with the gas (e.g., nitrogen) to remove oxygen from the tank 116 , the coffee may then be introduced into the tank 116 , and the pressure of the gas can be increased to the head pressure to cause the gas to be absorbed in the coffee in the tank 116 . At 224 , the coffee optionally may be mixed with a gas. For example, nitrogen can be directed into the storage tank 116 to mix with the coffee while the coffee is stored in the storage tank 116 . The mixture of coffee and the gas can provide a pleasant or desired taste to at least some consumers. In one embodiment, a method (e.g., for brewing cold coffee) includes brewing hot coffee at an elevated temperature by mixing coffee grounds with hot water, filtering the hot coffee to remove at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee to form filtered hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce a temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature above room temperature. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a temperature of at least 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes adding a first portion of a total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to a brewing tank, subsequently adding the coffee grounds to the brewing tank, and adding a remaining portion of the total amount of the hot water to be used to produce the cooled coffee to the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee, filtering the hot coffee, and rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee produces a batch amount of cooled coffee, where the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least seventy-five gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 150 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, the batch amount of cooled coffee is at least 1,500 gallons of the cooled coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water at a ratio of ten to one of the hot water to the coffee grounds by weight. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than fifteen minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee to a temperature no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within a time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, rapidly cooling the filtered hot coffee to reduce the temperature of the filtered hot coffee to form the cooled coffee includes cooling the filtered hot coffee from a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit to the temperature that is no warmer than forty degrees Fahrenheit within the time period of no longer than twenty minutes. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes a multiple stage brewing process that includes an immersion brewing stage of the hot coffee and a pressure assisted drip brewing stage of the hot coffee. In one example, the pressure assisted drip brewing stage occurs over a longer time period than the immersion brewing stage. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through multiple filters that remove the at least some of the coffee grounds from the hot coffee. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes mixing the coffee grounds with the hot water in a brewing tank, and wherein filtering the hot coffee includes passing the hot coffee through a filter body disposed inside the brewing tank. In one example, filtering the hot coffee includes additionally passing the hot coffee through an inline filter disposed in series with the filter body subsequent to the hot coffee being filtered by the filter body in the brewing tank. In one example, brewing the hot coffee includes agitating a mixture of the coffee grounds and the hot water. In one example, the method also includes mixing the cooled coffee with nitrogen gas. In one example, the nitrogen gas is mixed with the cooled coffee at a pressure of at least forty-five pounds per square inch. In one example, the cooled coffee is exposed to the nitrogen gas for at least twenty-four hours.

The complete text of these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a coated coffee particle and to various items made using such coated coffee particles. Further, the coated coffee particle may be formed into a structured coffee composition suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers can find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. Single serving coffee makers such as those by Hamilton Beach, Cuisinart, Mr. Coffee and others are generally designed to make a single cup of coffee (but can make slightly larger volumes) using a single use ground, or powered, coffee composition. In some instances, the coffee compositions used in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be powered in nature, in other instances the coffee compositions utilized in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be contained in what is typically viewed as a single use coffee “cup.” In this instance, such a coffee “cup” container/structure can contain, but does not require, a built-in filter element that lines the inside surface of such a single “use” coffee cup container/structure. It should be noted that although such coffee cup containers/structures are viewed as single use, the end user or consumer can, and often does, use such single use coffee cups more than once. Other forms of coffee makers and methods for preparing coffee include, but are not limited to, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced whereby various manufacturers provide coffee in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, are provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “containers,” “cups,” and/or “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are really only designed to brew a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tabletted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. Moreover, when roast and ground (R&G) coffee is exposed to air and/or sunlight for significant amounts of time, it goes stale overtime and exhibits papery notes that are evidence thereof. Further, roast and ground coffee must also be packaged in air tight packaging (e.g., wherein the removal of most oxygen must be purged therefrom) to avoid oxidation occurring thereon causing the roast and ground coffee to become stale. In light of the above and in view of the current products available in the marketplace, it would be desirable to develop a coffee composition and one or more items made therefrom that utilize a combination of instant coffee with one or more of roast coffee and/or ground coffee to achieve a coffee composition able to withstand exposure to air and light over some time without staling while still maintaining the product's integrity in combination with providing faster disassociation when brewed, thereby advantageously providing a variety of consistent coffee products of varying strengths with the ability to also use less robust packaging therefor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided are coated coffee particles and to various items made using the coated coffee particles. In another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particles can be formed into a structured coffee compositions suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a coffee composition comprising: a plurality of one or more ground roast coffee particles; and a coating of that includes a mixture of one or more coffee extracts and one or more extracts from the ground roast coffee on the outer surface, the coating has an average thickness in the range of about 5 microns to about 1,500 microns and the average coating coverage of the outer surface of the ground roast coffee particle is in the range of about 50% to about 100%; wherein a weight percent of the one or more ground roast coffee particles is in the range of about 60 wt % to about 90 wt % based on of the total weight of the one or more roast and ground coffee particles and the one or more coffee extracts, a weight percent of the one or more coffee extracts is in the range of about 10 wt % to about 40 wt % based on of the total weight of the one or more roast and ground coffee particles and the one or more coffee extracts. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of making a coffee composition comprising the steps of: (A) supplying a solution of one or more coffee extracts that includes coffee solids; (B) mixing one or m ore ground roast coffee particles that has an outer surface and the solution of one or more coffee extracts to form a granulated composition that includes ground roast coffee with a coating of one or more coffee extracts; (C) drying the granulated composition to achieve coated ground roast coffee particles where the coating has an average thickness in the range of about 5 microns to about 1,500 microns an average coating coverage of the outer surface of the ground roast coffee particle is in the range of about 50% to about 100%; wherein a weight percent of the one or more ground roast coffee particles is in the range of about 60 wt % to about 90 wt % based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee solids in the one or more coffee extracts, and a weight percent of the coffee solids in the one or more coffee extracts is in the range of about 10 wt % to about 40 wt % based on of the total weight of roast and the ground coffee particles and the coffee solids of the one or more coffee extracts.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use one or more of the present embodiments. The general principles described herein can be applied to embodiments and applications other than those detailed below without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Therefore, the present embodiments are not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed or suggested herein. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety as though they are fully set forth herein. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the numerical properties set forth in the following specification and claims are approximations that can vary depending on the desired properties sought to be obtained in embodiments of the present invention. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations; the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported with relative precision. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from error found in their respective measurements. As noted above, the present invention relates to coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to various coffee compositions and to a variety of items made using such coffee compositions wherein the coffee composition is in the form of coated particulates as disclosed herein. In yet another embodiments, the one or more coated coffee particulates can be formed into any three-dimensional coffee structure suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, old brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. Terminology Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Non-Coffee Binder” means a material which improves the structural integrity of a coffee composition made in accordance with the present invention. “Non-Coffee Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc., or any one or more binders made from one or more coffee ingredients and some amount of water. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, liquid coffee concentrate, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. Ground roast coffee can also be referred to as “roast coffee, ground coffee, or even a combination of roast coffee and ground coffee”. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Coffee solids” means the coffee constituents that are extracted or extractable during the brewing of coffee. Unless indicated otherwise, the term coffee solids refers to both the dissolved coffee solids and suspended coffee solids (e.g., very small grinds or fines). “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee composition means that the coffee composition is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the composition, when the composition is in place in a brewing device so as to be contacted with water (hot, cold or any temperature therebetween) for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example, flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3 weight percent) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. Furthermore, instant coffee used in the present invention can be prepared by any convenient process, of which a variety of processes are known to those skilled in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Moreover, representative spray drying processes that can provide suitable instant coffee are disclosed in, for example, pages 382 through 513 of Sivetz & Foote, “Coffee Processing Technology,” Vol. I (Avi Publishing Co. 1963), U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,771,343, 2,750,998, and 2,469,553, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Other suitable processes for providing instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,436,227, 3,493,388, 3,615,669, 3,620,756, and 3,652,293, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. The instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention can be prepared form any single variety of coffees or a blend of different varieties, and can be decaffeinated or un-decaffeinated, and can be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic as necessary. Additionally, instant coffee has many forms: spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid. “Liquid coffee concentrate” or “liquid coffee extract” as used herein designates an aqueous extract of the roasted coffee beans wherein the solids content is substantially greater than used for direct consumption as a beverage. The coffee solids content may be from about 10 wt % to about 75 wt %. The term as used here indicates a concentrated coffee extract, irrespective of this being liquid or a solid deep frozen coffee concentrate. As is generally known coffee extracts are recovered by contacting roasted and ground coffee beans with water or an aqueous solution. On an industrial scale, the intention is to achieve high extraction efficiency leading to extraction of aroma substances, that is odorants and flavorings, from the ground coffee. The concentration method is not particularly limited and can be performed by a known method and apparatus, evaporation, membrane concentration, concentration under reduced pressure, freeze concentration, and the like. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3 grams to about 5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of espresso strength brewed coffee. In one embodiment, the present invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures can be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing can include about 70° C. to about 100° C., about 80° C. to about 99° C., about 85° C. to about 97° C., or about 90° C. to about 96° C. However, it is contemplated that brewing may take place in other brewers at high pressures of greater than 100° C. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce anywhere from about 4 to about 12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The coffee products of the present invention can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and can be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. For more information related to ADC brewers see, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Coated Coffee Particle The general inventive concepts encompass various embodiments that are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a coated coffee particle. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may include a ground roast coffee particle that is coated with a coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particle may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, and at least partially drying the granulated composition. Optionally, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure. Examples of coffee extracts for use in the solution of coffee extracts include, but are not limited to, liquid coffee concentrate and instant coffee. It has been found that by mixing a solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee and at least partially drying the granulated composition a plurality of coated ground roast coffee particles may be prepared. As used herein, the coated ground roast coffee particles may be referred to as coated coffee particles or coated particulates. Through the mixing of the solution of coffee extracts with ground roasted coffee a portion of the ground roasted coffee is extracted. Accordingly, a matrix is formed that includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee on the ground roast coffee particles. Stated differently, the matrix is composed of compounds that originated from both the coffee exact and roast and ground coffee particles. In one or more embodiments, coffee exact may be prepared from an instant coffee, a liquid coffee concentrate, or a combination thereof. For the purpose of this specification, ground roast coffee particles that include a coating of the matrix or coffee extracts and extracts from the round roast coffee may be referred to as the coated ground roast coffee particles. The coating may also be referred to as a coffee extract and ground roast coffee extract matrix or simply the matrix. The coating at least partially covers the surface of the ground roast coffee particles and may fill in any cracks or crevices on the surface of the particle. The coating of the ground roast coffee particles may also bind the particles together to form a structured coffee composition. As indicated above, the matrix or coating of the ground roast coffee particles compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. This mixture may be experimentally shown via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR analysis shows a peak that corresponds with a wavelength of 940 nm in the coffee coating that is not present in coffee extracts such as those prepared from instant coffee. This peak is high in ground roasted coffee but is present in lower amounts in the coating. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the peak may be related to lipids present in the ground roast coffee, but it may also be a combination of lipids with other compounds that absorb in this region. Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/QTOF) analysis of the coffee coating and ground roast coffee particles, and the coffee extracts may also be used to show compositional differences. For example, coffee extracts such as instant coffee have an extremely low amount of lipids and a different compositional background compared to roast and ground coffee. The presence of high amounts of lipids and/or composition similar to roast and ground coffee but different from instant would indicate a solvent was used. Further, visual appearance of the coating through by surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy or other surface measuring techniques may be used to identify that the coating of coffee extracts was added using a solvent. Visual appearance may also suggest that a solvent was used. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of problems solved, the coated coffee particle advantageously provides a solution to one or more of the following problems: (a) fast disassociation in hot or cold water; (b) the creation of a larger surface area via capillary action creating void spaces due to solution of the instant component; (c) significantly higher percentages brew solids (BS) are achieved with less coffee weight and volume; (d) delivery of improved brew profile and rich color early in brew; (e) consistent results across a full range of brew methods (i.e., ADC, single serve, French Press, cup infuser, cold brew); (f) the structured coffee composition may be prepared with 100 percent coffee or coffee related flavorings/additives; (g) coffee flavor of instant coffee portion of the composition is enhanced by extraction of flavor notes from ground roast component; (h) cold brewing can be achieved with significantly less volumes of coffee and shorter brew times (e.g., about 2 to about 4 hours or about 2 to about 3 hours for a pitcher); and (i) the product stays fresher longer (less staling perception) when stored in low barrier packaging. Ingredients: Ground Roast Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be prepared from ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “ Arabica ( s )”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “ Robusta ( s )”). See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in its entirety. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of ground coffees produced from the coffee beans discussed above can be used to make the structured coffee composition. Further, mixtures of two or more different varieties, or types, of ground coffees described above can also be used in combination to prepare the structured coffee composition. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12 weight percent. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology , “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112 to 169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. In other embodiments, the coffee been may be “pre-dried” prior to roasting. In these or other embodiments, the coffee beans may be dried to a moisture content in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Exemplary methods of pre-drying a coffee bean are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,160,757 and 5,322,703 and which are both incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. This drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional or low moisture drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at a temperature in the range of about 70° F. to about 325° F. (21° C. to 163° C.), or from about 90° F. to about 300° F., or from about 120° F. to about 275° F., or even from about 160° F. to about 250° F. over drying times lasting about 1 minute to about 24 hours, or from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, or from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, or from about 3 hours to about 6 hours, or even from about 4 hours to about 5 hours. After drying the green coffee beans (and optionally pre-drying the coffee beans), the coffee beans to are typically processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of the present invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans can be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8° C. to about 371.1° C. (about 350° F. to about 700° F.), or about 176.8° C. to about 260° C. (about 350° F. to about 500° F.), or about 204.4° C. to about 232.2° C. (about 400° C. to about 450° F.), or about 260° C. to about 287.8° C. (about 500° C. to about 550° F.), or about 315.6° C. to about 348.9° C. (about 600° C. to about 660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and can, for example, be about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or about 12 minutes to about 18 minutes, or can be about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 6 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 4 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and can, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1 minutes to about 3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° F. to about 1200° F. (about 177 C to about 649° C.), or from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, or from about 10 seconds to about 47 seconds. As is well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer ., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee that is used to make the structured coffee composition can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, or from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, or even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as about 250 μm (microns) and as high as about 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of about 400 μm to about 2,500 μm, or from about 500 μm to about 2,400 μm, or from about 650 μm to about 2,200 μm, or from about 800 μm to about 2,000 μm, or from about 900 μm to about 1,00 μm, or from about 1,000 μm to about 1,600 μm, or from about 1,200 μm to about 1,400 μm, or even about 1,300 μm. The coffee beans can be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to about 1.5 mm, or from about 300 μm to about 1,600 μm, or even from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles can be broken down during three-dimensional shape molding, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the molded structure formed from the various coffee compositions described herein. In one or embodiments, the size of the ground roast coffee particles may be described with reference to the size range of the coffee typically employed for a particular brewing method. In one or more embodiments, the ground roast coffee particles may be a coarse grind typically used for French press or percolator coffee brew, for example (e.g., about 900 microns to about 1400 microns), a medium-coarse grind typically used for pour over brewers, flat bottom drip brewer or ADC, or Aeropress, for example, (e.g., about 800 microns to about 1200 microns), a medium grind typically used for clever dripper, café solo, or single serve brewer, for example, (e.g., about 500 microns to about 900 microns), a medium fine grind typically used for Turkish coffee, for example, (e.g., about 200 microns to about 550 microns) or a super fine grind typically used for espresso, or moka pot, for example (e.g., about 200 microns to about 450 microns), or any one or more combinations thereof based on the desired type of coffee beverage and coffee strength. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by full particle size distribution curve. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than about 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. In one or more embodiment the roast ground coffee particles may be prepared using mill flaking. Mill flaking technology or mill flaking is a unique grinding process that creates a larger surface area on each flake for hot water to easily extract more of our coffee flavor. Flaked coffee is further disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,676, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/mL to about 0.35 g/mL such as, for example, about 0.263 g/mL, about 0.288 g/mL, about 0.325 g/mL, or even about 0.35 g/mL, if desired. Alternatively, the structured coffee composition can also be made for ground roast coffees having lower or higher densities, if desired. For example, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from high density coffees having densities of greater than about 0.40 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of up to about 0.60 g/cm 3 , although even higher densities are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. Similarly, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from low density coffees having densities of less than about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 to about 0.25 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.22 g/cm 3 to about 0.23 g/cm 3 (such as about 0.19 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 , about 0.21 g/cm 3 , about 0.22 g/cm 3 , about 0.23 g/cm 3 , about 0.24 g/cm 3 or even about 0.25 g/cm 3 ). Furthermore, the inventive coffee compositions can be made from higher density coffees having densities from about 0.39 g/cm 3 to about 0.57 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.40 g/cm 3 to about 0.56 g/cm 3 , or from about 0.46 g/cm 3 to about 0.48 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.47 g/cm 3 . In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3.5 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.75 to about 4.25 weight percent. In one instance, the inventive coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.6 weight percent, or from about 2.85 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or even from about 4.5 weight percent to about 4.85 weight percent. Generally speaking, the structured coffee composition can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, in one embodiment it is desirable that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular,” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. In another instance, embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the coffee compositions of the present invention is/are decaffeinated are also within the scope of the present invention. In one or more embodiments, the amount of one or more ground roast coffees (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the structured coffee composition used are in the range of about 60 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, or from about 65 weight percent to about 87.5 weight percent, or from about 70 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, or from about 72.5 weight percent to about 82.5 weight percent, or from about 75 weight percent to about 80 weight percent even about 77.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Instant Coffee As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include instant coffee. The instant coffee may be used to form a slurry in the preparation of the structured coffee composition by adding water to an instant coffee. The slurry is then combined with roast and ground coffee. It has been found that when an instant coffee is included in the structured coffee composition, the instant coffee may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. The presence of instant coffee in coffee compositions and/or structures can be detected by a number of different methods. However, one method is described in R. M. Noyes and C. M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee product to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. See various methods of detecting presence of instant coffee also as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different instant coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the method of which the instant coffee is prepared and other factors. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of less than 7 weight percent, or less than 6.5 weight percent, or less than 6 weight percent, or of less than 5.5 weight percent, or of less than 5 weight percent, or less than 4.5 weight percent, or of less than 4 weight percent, or less than 3.5 weight percent, or of less than 3 weight percent. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of about 0.5 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.5 to about 4.25 weight percent. Suitable instant coffee for use in the structured coffee composition include, but are not limited to, spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid instant coffees. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the yield of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high yield instant coffee, a medium yield instant coffee, or a low yield instant coffee. High yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of greater than 45%. High yields instant coffees may be obtained using a primary and then a secondary extract with high water temperatures. Typically, high yield instant coffees include a high robusta content to maximize extraction yield. Medium yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of between 25% to 45%. Typically, medium yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content with a minimal robusta content. Low yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of less than 25%. Low yield instant coffees may be obtained using only a primary extraction at temperatures generally at or below 100° C. Typically, low yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%). In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the quality of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high quality instant coffee or a low quality instant coffee. High quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that produce a cup of brewed coffee with an aroma similar to a roast and ground coffee and have a flavor with minimal processed and Carmel notes. Typically, high quality instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%) and are produced at a low extraction yield. Low quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that have a dull or unexciting flavor that may taste stale. Typically, low quality instant coffees include a high robusta content and are produced at a high extraction yield. In some embodiments a low yield, high quality instant coffee is used. In another embodiment a high yield instant coffee is used. The structured coffee composition may employ a variety and types of instant coffee can be used, including a high yield, high quality instant coffee, a high yield, low quality instant, or a low yield, low quality instant, or one or more combinations thereof any one or more instant coffee varieties and types of instant coffee. Exemplary instant coffees can be used with the present invention to make the coffee composition, including but not limited to, those as shown below in Table 1.

In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee that may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, instant coffees may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Liquid Coffee Concentrate As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may include a liquid coffee concentrate. Liquid coffee concentrates may be purchased commercially or prepared prior to inclusion in the structured coffee composition. It has been found that when a liquid coffee concentrate is included in the preparation of a structured coffee composition, the liquid coffee concentrate may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. In one or more embodiments, a liquid coffee concentrates may be prepared by concentrating the draw-off stream from a liquid extraction process. This process utilizes hot and/or cool water and and/or steam to extract soluble coffee from roast and ground coffee. The liquid stream may then be concentrated by either thermal evaporation or freeze concentration or an alternate method. The concentrated stream of liquid coffee extract can be utilized to create a slurry, or with a roast and ground coffee with or without adding additional process water. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. An exemplary liquid coffee concentrate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,113,643, which is incorporated herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, a commercially available liquid coffee concentrate may be employed in the structured coffee composition. Liquid coffee concentrate is often sold in frozen form, and may be thawed prior to being combined with roast and ground coffee. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be characterized by the percent of coffee solids in the total volume of the liquid coffee concentrate. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may have coffee solids in an amount of about 10% to about 75%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 15% to about 70%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 20% to about 65%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 25% to about 60%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 30% to about 58%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 35% to about 55%, and in other embodiments in an amount of about 40% to about 50%. The amount of liquid coffee concentrate that may be included in the structured coffee composition should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least property such as binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, and staling resistance. In one or more embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on the overall weight of the total weight of structured coffee composition. Additional Additives The coated coffee particles may include on or more additional ingredients. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the structured coffee composition (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context). Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included and, surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee products. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290; 6,277,428; 6,090,431; 1,951,357, and EP 813816, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. While binders included in certain embodiments, in other embodiments the structured coffee composition is free of non-coffee binders. In one or more embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added during the step of mixing the one or more ground roast coffee and the solution of one or more coffee extracts. In other embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added to the structured coffee composition (e.g., after the step of drying). Flavorants, both liquid and solid (or dry), can be included in the structured coffee products in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Crème Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. The flavorants that can be used include those known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavorants. A solid sweetener such as white granulated sugar may be used in connection with the structured coffee product. Examples of a whitening agent that can be used in connection with the structured coffee products include liquid dairy components and dry dairy components. Other suitable sweeteners that can be used in connection with the structured coffee compositions are those well known in the art, including both natural and artificial sweeteners, including but not limited to also high intensity sweeteners. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,706,785; 10,182,583; and 10,278,407, which disclose flavorants, sweeteners, and whitening agents for inclusion into the structured coffee products. These patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, where the coated coffee particle is in a structured coffee composition, the structured coffee composition may be made with one or more layers of additives, for example, coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers on a side of the structured coffee composition (e.g., the top, bottom, or any side or rounded face of the structured coffee composition). In these or other embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers that bisect or are situated between two portions of the coffee composition in the structured coffee composition. In other various embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be made with one or more various elements including the coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc., wherein the structured coffee composition is a homogenous mixture of any one or more of the foregoing included therein. Method of Making a Coated Coffee Particle: As indicated above, the coated coffee particles may be prepared by mixing a solution of brewed coffee extracts with ground coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. In one or more embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts may be prepared from instant coffee. In these or other embodiments, the instant coffee may be mixed with a solvent to prepare the solution of brewed coffee extracts. Suitable solvents for used in preparing the solution of brewed coffee extracts include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, brewed extracts from coffee, tea, juice, carbonated water, nitrogen infused water, and liquid CO 2 , among others. Any suitable method of mixing the instant coffee and the solvent may be used. Generally, the instant coffee and the solvent are mixed until smooth and uniform consistency is achieved. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using an instant coffee may be a slurry. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent may be from about 4:1 to about 1:2, in other embodiments from about 3:1 to about 1:1.75, in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 1:1.5, in other embodiments from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.25, in other embodiments from about 1.15:1 to about 1:15.1, in other embodiments from about 1.1:1 to about 1:1.1, and in other embodiments from about 1.05:1 to about 1:1.05. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of brewed coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes instant coffee may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, liquid coffee concentrate may be used as or to prepare the solution of coffee extract(s). In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee extract may be used as prepared (i.e. the product of an extraction and an optional concentration). In other embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be diluted with a solvent. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extracts prepared using a liquid coffee concentrate may be a slurry. Regardless, in one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts. In these or other embodiments, the solution of brewed coffee extracts that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may include a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. For example, a solution of coffee extracts may be prepped by combining a solution prepared by combining instant coffee and a solvent with a liquid coffee concentrate. In other embodiments, the instant coffee may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate to prepare a solution of coffee extracts. The ranges and amount of coffee solids provided above for the liquid coffee concentrate may be used in a solution of coffee extracts that includes a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. The solution of coffee extracts may then be combined with a ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Any suitable method of mixing the solution of coffee extracts and the ground roast coffee may be used. Suitable mixing device include, but are not limited to stand mixers, spatulas, and paddle mixers. In certain embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may be sprayed on the ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Typically, prior to drying the granulated composition may be described as sticky. In one or more embodiments, the amount of solution of coffee extracts and the amount of ground roast coffee in the granulated composition may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the weight of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract(s) to the weight of the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the ratio of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extracts to the ground roast coffee may be from about 10:90 to about 40:60, in other embodiments from about 12.5:87.5 to about 37.5:62.5, in other embodiments from about 15:85 to about 35:65, in other embodiments from about 17.5:82.5 to about 32.5:67.5, and in other embodiments from about 20:80 to about 30:70. After the granulated composition it may be formed or otherwise shaped into a structure. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into an agglomerate with a random shape. In other embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed or molded into geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure using a press or a die. Suitable presses include a Carver Press, for example Model #3912. In these or other embodiments, a low amount of pressure or compaction should be employed in the forming of the structure so the resultant structured coffee composition is not completely compressed and includes a level of porosity. For example, a de minimis amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a pressure that slightly exceeds 0 pounds per square inch (PSI). In other embodiments, an amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a compaction of the granulated composition of between 60% and 70%. For example, a portion of the granulation composition may be molded using a target compaction travel on a carver press of 94% which is calculated by taking the amount in millimeters of the 100 percent travel of the die assembly and multiplying by 0.94 to determine the amount of travel in millimeters to achieve a 94% compaction travel target using hand compaction until the target travel is achieved thereby resulting in a compaction of 60 percent to 70 percent of the granulated coffee. After the granulated composition is formed into a structure, it may be dried to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water or other solvents may be removed by air drying, microwave drying, infrared drying, etc. After the drying step a residual amount of water, moisture, or a combination thereof may remain in the coated coffee particles. The solvent content (i.e. water, other solvents, or a combination of water and other solvents) of the of the coated coffee particles may be determined by oven drying coupled with weight analysis to provide the most universal method across solvents, allowing one to measure percent loss of the solvent or Karl Fischer Titration. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a final solvent content of less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 9.75 weight percent, less than about 9.5 weight percent, less than about 9.25 weight percent, less than about 9 weight percent, less than about 8.75 weight percent, less than about 8.5 weight percent, less than about 8.25 weight percent, less than about 8 weight percent, less than about 7.75 weight percent, less than about 7.5 weight percent, less than about 7.25 weight percent, less than about 7 weight percent, less than about 6.75 weight percent, less than about 6.5 weight percent, less than about 6.25 weight percent, less than about 6 weight percent, less than about 5.75 weight percent, less than about 5.5 weight percent, less than about 5.25 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 4.75 weight percent, less than about 4.5 weight percent, less than about 4.25 weight percent, less than about 4 weight percent, less than about 3.75 weight percent, less than about 3.5 weight percent, less than about 3.25 weight percent, less than about 3 weight percent, less than about 2.75 weight percent, less than about 2.5 weight percent, less than about 2.25 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1.75 weight percent, less than about 1.5 weight percent, less than about 1.25 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the coffee composition and/or structure present. In one or more embodiments, the water content of the structured coffee composition may be described in reference to the water content of the ingredients used to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the ground roast coffee employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. In still other embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the combination of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee (i.e. the percent of water in the combined amount of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee) employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. For example, if a structured coffee composition is prepared with a ground roast coffee and an instant coffee that both have an initial water content of 3%, the structured coffee composition may have a water content with 15% of 3% (i.e., 2.55% to 3.45%).

In these or other embodiments, the coated coffee particles may include a coating with a mean thickness of at most about 325 microns, at most about 350 microns, at most about 375 microns, at most about 400 microns, at most about 425 microns, at most about 450 microns, at most about 500 microns, at most about 525 microns, at most about 550 microns, at most about 575 microns, at most about 600 microns, at most about 625 microns, at most about 650 microns, at most about 675 microns, at most about 700 microns, at most about 725 microns, at most about 750 microns, at most about 775 microns, at most about 800 microns, at most about 825 microns, at most about 850 microns, at most about 875 microns, at most about 900 microns, at most about 925 microns, at most about 950 microns, at most about 975 microns, at most about 1000 microns, at most about 1025 microns, at most about 1050 microns, at most about 1075 microns, at most about 1100 microns, at most about 1125 microns, at most about 1150 microns, at most about 1175 microns, at most about 1200 microns, at most about 1225 microns, at most about 1250 microns, at most about 1275 microns, at most about 1300 microns, at most about 1325 microns, at most about 1350 microns, at most about 1375 microns, at most about 1400 microns, at most about 1425 microns, at most about 1450 microns, at most about 1475 microns, or even about 1500. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may include a coating with a mean thickness of about 5 microns to about 1500 microns, in other embodiments about 10 microns to about 1450 microns, in other embodiments about 20 microns to about 1400 microns, in other embodiments about 30 microns to about 1350 microns, in other embodiments about 40 microns to about 1300 microns, in other embodiments about 50 microns to about 1250 microns, in other embodiments about 60 microns to about 1200 microns, in other embodiments about 70 microns to about 1150 microns, in other embodiments about 80 microns to about 1100 microns, in other embodiments about 90 microns to about 1050 microns, in other embodiments about 100 microns to about 1000 microns, in other embodiments about 110 microns to about 950 microns, in other embodiments about 120 microns to about 900 microns, in other embodiments about 130 microns to about 850 microns, in other embodiments about 140 microns to about 800 microns, in other embodiments about 150 microns to about 750 microns, in other embodiments about 160 microns to about 700 microns, in other embodiments about 175 microns to about 600 microns, in other embodiments about 200 microns to about 550 microns, in other embodiments about 225 microns to about 500 microns, in other embodiments about 250 microns to about 450 microns, in other embodiments about 275 microns to about 400 microns, in other embodiments about 290 microns to about 350 microns, and in other embodiments about 300 microns to about 325 microns. In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the amount of the surface of the coffee particle that is coated by the coating that includes a mixture of the brewed coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the average surface area coverage of the coffee particle is in the range of about 50 percent to 100 percent, about 52.5 percent to 97.5 percent, or from about 55 percent to about 95 percent, or from about 57.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, or from about 60 percent to about 90 percent, or from about 62.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, or from about 65 percent to about 85 percent, or from about 67.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, or from about 70 percent to about 80 percent, or from about 72.5 percent to about 77.5 percent, or even about 75 percent of the exposed surface area of the coffee particle. Composition Size and Configuration: As indicated above, the coated coffee particle may be used in structured coffee composition. Although the structured coffee compositions may be made in any size and/or three-dimensional geometric shape, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produce a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, an structured coffee may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and can optionally be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to break any coffee structure made from the one or more coffee compositions into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e., break a molded product/pellet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as one-half of a standard serving, or one-third of standard serving, or one-quarter of standard serving. The end user/consumer may add or reduce the number of coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference, to achieve brewed coffee that is weaker or stronger than normal. Since, in one embodiment, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; and 9,474,290, which disclose methods of adjusting the weakness or strength of a standard brewed coffee, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. Furthermore, about one (1) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about one (1) cup of coffee; or about three (3) standard servings of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or about four (4) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or even about five (5) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of dimensions, the process and ingredients the structured coffee composition may have a cylindrical structure measuring about 29 mm to about 33 mm in diameter and about 19.5 mm to about 32 mm in thickness and about 14.0 cm3 to about 27.0 cm3 in volume, which can have variations thereabout as further described below and shown in FIG. 2 , and Tables 2, 3, and 4. The diameter and thickness can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 6.5 grams, about 7.5 grams, about 8.5 grams, about 10.5 grams, or even about 12.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 13 grams, about 15 grams, about 17 grams, about 21 grams, or even about 25 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 19.5 grams, about 22.5 grams, about 25.5 grams, about 31.5 grams, or even about 37.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 26 grams, about 30 grams, about 34 grams, about 42 grams, or even about 50 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. Similarly, structured coffee compositions made with different dose sizes, e.g., a coffee product made to produce one-third of a standard serving of brewed coffee per structure or molded product, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different structure configurations for the structured coffee composition are also possible. For example, cylinder, cube, cuboid, sphere, pellet, ellipsoid, triangular pyramid, hexagonal prism, truncated triangular pyramid, truncated square pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, truncated hexagonal pyramid, cone, truncated cone, diamond, a three dimensional shape with an oval-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with heart-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with triangle-shaped face, or pillow shape are contemplated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical molded structure can, if so desired, be concave or convex. Additionally, or alternatively, the outer surface of a structure or molded product can have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be in the form of a particulate or an agglomeration of particles. See FIG. 1 for examples of structural shapes. It should also be noted that comparative examples are shown in some tables and figures herein, which can be labeled “Tablet Example”. The comparative example, “Tablet Example”, is a coffee tablet made using a multi-step compaction process as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Resistance to Staling In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles may have a resistance to staling or a reduced perception of staling. Resistance to staling may be measured through the quantification of lipid oxidation byproducts, such as hexanal, that are known to be generated during coffee staling and contribute to the perception of stale coffee particulate or products. Reduced perception of staling in roasted coffee particulate or products by the end user (consumer) once brewed, can be measured though the use of a trained sensory panel calibrated to identify stale notes, such as “papery,” in a coffee brew. Advantageously, the coated coffee particles may protect coffee flavor from one or more negative organoleptic effects, such as development of paper off-notes, of staling, especially those staling effects caused by lipid oxidation. In one embodiment, this is accomplished via the use of a coated coffee particulate or product (i.e., roasted and ground coffee or coffee structures formed from a roasted and ground coffee particulate or product that has been coated in any manner discussed herein) which may limit exposure of such a coffee particulate or product to environmental conditions that cause or result in enhanced lipid oxidation. In addition, the structured coffee compositions may minimize surface area to volume ratios for coffee particulate or products that will be exposed to oxidative forces, further minimizing lipid oxidation and staling thereof. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 4 days in a UV light box. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and assessed by expert panelists for staling. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Further experimental details are included in the example section. The staling data may be reported along with the exposed surface area (i.e., the area of the surface that is exposed to light divided by the total volume of the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.5, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 1. Stated differently, the brewed coffee is perceived as not stale. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.82, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 2. Stated differently the brewed coffee is perceived to have a very slight off note. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by aging the coffee under UV lights and testing determining the hexanal content. The coffee may be aged by exposing coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 7 days. After the exposure to UV light, the coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be brewed and the amount of hexanal may be determined. Further experimental details are included in the example section. In one or more embodiments, the amount of hexanal after a week of exposure of light in the coated coffee particles may be less than 40 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 30 ng/g, other embodiments less than 25 ng/g, and in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g. Packaging and Use: The coated coffee particles are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages and/or packaging. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be provided in a package as a plurality of coated coffee particles. In other embodiments, the coated coffee particles may be bound together as a structured coffee composition. Due to the resistance to staling of the coated coffee particles, they allow for reduction of packaging materials and lowers packaging cost. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; woven and nonwoven filter paper, a nylon mesh material, boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. Moreover, the instant coated slurry and/or liquid coffee concentrate can even be used to coat the inside of a package or packaging material for the coffee compositions and/or coffee structures thereof. The packaging for the coated coffee particles may be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the coated coffee particles are periodically used by the consumer, the unused coated coffee particles that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. If desired, in embodiments where the coated coffee particles are used in structured coffee compositions, the structured coffee compositions may be packaged in any desired number so that each packaged amount can be designed to yield any desired number of brewed coffee servings and/or strengths. For example, structured coffee compositions are in one embodiment designed to produce a single serving of coffee per coffee composition and/or structures thereof can be packaged individually to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, in groups of two to facilitate making two cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of three to facilitate making three cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle and so forth up to groups of twelve to facilitate making twelve cups of coffee in a single brew. The structured coffee compositions may be packaged with more or less of the same to produce stronger or weaker coffee for a standard brew of coffee since, in one embodiment, the coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) can be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. Furthermore, in yet other embodiments designed to produce a single serving of coffee per structured coffee composition can be packaged individually as structured coffee composition to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, or can be packaged in a group of three (3) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of about four (4) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of even about five (5) structured coffee compositions coffee to facilitate making about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. One advantage is that two or more structured coffee compositions may be, via two different coffee compositions or structures formed from each respective different structured coffee composition, combined in the same brew to produce a preferred brew in which the one or more properties resulting from the combination of different coffee compositions or structures provide a desired variation, change or combination in flavor, strength, caffeine content, or other such characteristic in the preferred brew. A wide variety of types of structured coffee compositions can be provided together in a pre-packaged kit, or in a consumer selected array, to facilitate preparation of a preferred brew specific to an individual consumer's preferences. As such, an exemplary kit may include a plurality of varied structured coffee compositions, with at least two of the varied structured coffee compositions having a different predetermined property, such as, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, level of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee, or type, of coffee bean treatment. Such a kit can be provided with instructions for combining the two or more types of coffee composition to prepare a desired brewed coffee. These instructions may include one or more “recipes” for preparing one or more special predetermined blends of coffee. The present invention may be packaged as coffee compositions (if in loose powdered form) and/or as an appropriate number of structured coffee compositions. See various methods of packaging and use of coffee compositions and products as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition Properties: In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with brewing water of a desired and/or suitable temperature (any temperature could be used, for example in the range of 1° C. to 100° C., as both hot and cold coffee brews are desirable) at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated herein. The strength/robustness of the structured coffee compositions may conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a product's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the structure in an axial direction over the height of the structure or across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure. Product hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the structure is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the structure breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the structure to break is taken as the hardness of the structure, which is sometimes referred to as the “structure crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. As shown in Table 2 below and FIGS. 3 A and 3 B, the structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the height or axial direction of the structure in the range of about 21.3 N (Newtons) to about 61.7 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 20 N to about 65 N, about 22.5 N to about 62.5 N, about 25 N to about 60 N, about 27.5 N to about 57.5 N, about 30 N to about 55 N, about 32.5 N to about 52.5 N, about 35 N to about 50 N, about 37.5 N to about 47.5 N, about 40 N to about 45 N or even about 42.5 N. The structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure in the range of about 11.1 N (Newtons) to about 51.6 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 10 N to about 52.5 N, about 12.5 N to about 50 N, about 15 N to about 45 N, about 17.5 N to about 42.5 N, about 20 N to about 40 N, about 20 N to about 37.5 N, about 22.5 N to about 35 N, about 25 N to about 32.5 N, or even about 30 N.

For convenience, the friability of the structured coffee compositions can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating the structure in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these structures that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The structures should not be broken to obtain the weight of the structure in grams, but adjust the number of whole structures to come as close as possible to weight of the structure in grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of structures represents the friability of these structures. As shown in Table 3 below and in FIG. 4 , it has been found that the structured coffee compositions, can have a friability in the range of about 50 to 55 percent to about 100 percent (total disintegration of the coffee structure), of about 57.5 percent to about 97.5 percent, of about 60 percent to about 95 percent, of about 62.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, of about 65 percent to about 90 percent, of about 67.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, of about 70 percent to about 85 percent, of about 72.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, of about 75 percent to about 80 percent, or even about 77.5 percent.

Water activity may be determined using a water activity meter such as a Rotronic Hygrolab Water Activity Meter. In one or more embodiments, the coated coffee particles may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. Furthermore, generally speaking, and as shown in Table 4 (water activity data) above, structured coffee compositions having the above combination of properties of about stated values and/or within claimed ranges for hardness, friability, and density within the diameter and height measurements and the about stated target weights may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. It has been further found that the coated coffee particles achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise conventional ground roast coffee composition. That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the coated coffee particles are used in a typical ADC coffee maker or other brewing devices than when the same amount of conventional ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. Yield ratios provided by the structured coffee compositions, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the structured coffee compositions relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of conventional ground roast coffee (e.g., the ground roast coffee used to prepare the structured coffee composition) is normally greater than about 1 and in many instances greater than about 1.1, greater than about 1.2, greater than about 1.25, greater than about 1.5, greater than about 1.75, greater than about 2, greater than about 2.25, greater, than about 2.5, greater than about 2.75, and even about 3 on a weight basis. As discussed herein, various particle sizes for the roast and ground coffee may be used, which may result in various percent brew solids, density, and percent porosity in the molded product. Porosity is measured by Micro-CT (also called microtomography or micro-computed tomography). In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity (i.e., percent of total volume) in the structured coffee compositions may greater than 40%, greater than 42.5%, greater than 45% or greater than 47.5%, or greater than 50%, or greater than 52.5%, or greater than 55%, or greater than 57.5%, or greater than 60%. In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity in the structured coffee compositions may range between from about 40% to about 80%, or from about 42.5% to about 77.5%, or from about 45% to about 75%, or from about 47.5% to about 72.5%, or from about 50% to about 70%, or from about 52.5% to about 67.5%, or from about 55% to about 65%, or from about 57.5% to about 62.5%, or even about 60%. In light of the above, when a standard serving of coffee is prepared the percent brew solids achieved by the structed coffee compositions are in the range of about 0.90 weight percent to about 3.00 weight percent, or from about 0.95 weight percent to about 2.95 weight percent, about 1.00 weight percent to about 2.9 weight percent, or from about 1.05 weight percent to about 2.85 weight percent, or from about 1.10 weight percent to about 2.80 weight percent, about 1.15 weight percent to about 2.75 weight percent, or from about 1.20 weight percent to about 2.70 weight percent, about 1.25 weight percent to about 2.65 weight percent, about 1.30 weight percent to about 2.60 weight percent, about 1.35 weight percent to about 2.55 weight percent, about 1.40 weight percent to about 2.50 weight percent, about 1.45 weight percent to about 2.45 weight percent, about 1.50 weight percent to about 2.40 weight percent, about 1.55 weight percent to about 2.35 weight percent, about 1.60 weight percent to about 2.30 weight percent, about 1.65 weight percent to about 2.25 weight percent, about 1.70 weight percent to about 2.20 weight percent, about 1.75 weight percent to about 2.15 weight percent, about 1.80 weight percent to about 2.10 weight percent, about 1.85 weight percent to about 2.05 weight percent, about 1.90 weight percent to about 2.00 weight percent, or even about 1.95 weight percent, based on the weight of the coffee brewed. For measurement of the percent (%) brew solids (% BS) used herein, the refractive index (RI) is measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. Then a linear regression equation is developed and used to correlate the RI to % BS. The coated coffee particles and structured coffee compositions prepared from the coated coffee particles coated coffee particles disassociate and brews rapidly in both room temperature and cold water applications when used for cold brew coffee, which is shown in Table 5. The present invention disassociates in hot water (196.5-202° F.) in about 15 to about 21 seconds, in room temperature water (72-72.3° F.) in about 1 minute 7 seconds to about 1 minute 24 seconds, and in cold water (38.7-42.3° F.) in about 2 minutes 51 seconds to about 4 minutes 12 seconds. While the coated coffee particles may be brewed by any conventional means, the coated coffee particles, when used for quick cold brew coffee provides a bold cold brew coffee strength to remain bold when served over ice. It uses less coffee and brews in a shorter time frame than conventional cold brew formulations to provide a consistent brew.

The follow list of coffee products are used to produce the various coffee brews tested by the panelists: (a) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at standard drop weight (30.5 grams) (FOL 30.5 grams); (b) Folgers Classic Roast and Ground at drop weight matching the present invention composition drop weight (34.0 grams) (FOL 34 grams); (c) Present Invention (4×8.5 gram structures)−80 percent Folgers Classic Roast and Ground+20 percent Colcafe Instant (Invention); (d) Folgers Instant Crystals (14.2 grams) (Fol Inst); and (e) Colcafe Instant (14.2 grams)−Low Yield High Quality Instant (Colcafe). All products are brewed in Mr. Coffee ADC brewers in 1420 mL H2O at a temperature of about 157° F. +/−1° F. The panels are run blind and randomized. These products are evaluated and compared over a number of different coffee flavor attributes. It is determined that the coated coffee particles produce a brewed coffee that has the most coffee “Body,” such as heaviness, mouthfeel, consistency, and/or weight as it coated the tongue of the panelists. Further, Body, is the feeling of the consistency of the liquid related to the amount of extraction of the solids or any other additives that increase the viscosity (References: heaviness on tongue, fullness of mouthfeel). As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 , the coated coffee particle closely tracks the attributes of a conventional roast and ground coffee (both Folgers Classic roast and ground coffees) even with a mixture of instant coffee therein with the roast and ground. Working Examples: Proof of UV Treatment as an Accelerant to Induce Staling: A validation experiment is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of UV treatment to accelerate staling. This experiment evaluates the degree of difference (DOD) of brewed coffee flavor from a sealed control. The treatments include coffee placed on a foil lined tray subjected to UV aging, coffee placed on a foil lined tray and left in the dark, coffee left enclosed in its original canister after opening, and coffee left sealed in its original canister without opening. At the beginning of the experiment, ten cans of Folgers Classic Roast coffee are procured from a local grocery store (Buehler's, Orrville, OH). All cans are within their use by dates at time of evaluation. All cans are subjected to oxygen measurement before opening to ensure fresh coffee. Four randomly selected cans are opened and 29.5 gram lots of roast and ground coffee from each can are placed in a thin layer on two foil lined service trays (number of tray samples=8 trays total). Four of these trays are placed under UV lights, four are placed in dark in laboratory drawers. After coffee samples are distributed, the cans from which they came are then closed with their manufacture supplied lids and placed in a dark drawer at room temperature for storage. Finally, one tray of 29.5 grams of instant coffee (Folger's) is placed under UV light as well. Coffee samples are evaluated against a sealed reference at one, four and eleven days of storage. On the final day, the instant coffee is included in the evaluation. Degree of difference is scored internally by expert cuppers on the following scale: 0.2 no difference; 0.3 very slight difference; 0.5 slight difference; 0.8 moderate difference; and 1.2 large difference. Results: It is found that coffee stored under UV light is noticeably stale after one day of aging and is moderately to very different in flavor from a sealed control by day four. By day eleven, coffee stored under UV light and in the dark on trays are both moderately to very different from sealed controls and classified as stale (See Table 6 below). These results indicate that UV light treatment does accelerate the aging process. It also highlights that the sensory qualities produced by UV staling are the same as encountered in coffee samples that stale in the dark, supporting the theory that both UV exposed and non-UV exposed samples are undergoing similar aging reactions, but at different rates. Table 6 below discloses average degree of difference (DOD) scores for coffee stored under different conditions and illustrates that UV light rapidly accelerated the aging process.

The experiment examines four product forms all using an 80:20 weight percent mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee: (a) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee dry mix; (b) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed herein using water in the form of a three-dimensional coffee structure; (c) roast and ground coffee/instant coffee mix according to the inventive process discussed above using water in the form of a loose unformed particulate; and (d) flaked roast and ground coffee with instant in a dry mix. Evaluations are carried out using two different instant coffees, a high yield regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration and a high quality Colombian instant coffee from Coleafé. The experiment is set up as a randomized block design with five blocks containing three replicates of each of the four coffee forms disclosed above. At the start of the experiment, the first block is subjected to in initial evaluation before aging (Time (T)=0 days). After the initial assessment, the remaining blocks are placed under UV lights. Additional samples are evaluated at one, four and seven days. On sampling days, a block is chosen at random for evaluation. Coffee from the selected block is brewed (34 grams coffee to 1420 grams water) on an ADC brewer and subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using a trained sensory panel (no. of evaluators=9 to 11 evaluators per tasting). Panelists assign each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Before submitting coffee samples for sensory analysis, two 5.0 mL aliquots of each brew are collected for monitoring of chemical markers for lipid oxidation, including hexanal. Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Finally, samples from each treatment in each block are saved for imaging using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Results: It is found that there is a significant reduction in both staling flavor and the chemical marker for staling (hexanal) in the formed coffee structures of item (b) above versus all other treatments for both instant types (see FIGS. 9 A and 9 B). There is no difference between the un-formed three-dimensional coffee structures (item (c) above) and the roast and ground/instant mix control (Item (d) above). It is further determined that the exposed surface of the three-dimensional coffee structure of item (b) above has a significantly higher level of hexanal per gram dry coffee than the core of the structure (see FIG. 10 ). This suggests a surface area effect for protecting the coffee from staling. It is found that a coating of instant coffee is formed on individual roast and ground coffee particles during the methods of the present invention using water as described herein. However, it is also found that the coating of the roast and ground coffee particles is uneven, leaving some areas with no instant coffee coating (see FIGS. 11 A, 11 B and 11 C). Specifically, FIG. 9 A illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above are scored significantly lower compared to all other forms of coffee (items (a), (c) and (d)) for papery notes, a measure of coffee staling, for both instant coffee types. FIG. 9 B illustrates that the three-dimensional coffee structures of item (b) above have significantly lower hexanal concentrations as compared to all other treatments (items (a), (c) and (d)) starting at day three of the experiment for both instant coffees evaluated. FIG. 10 illustrates that the surface of the three-dimensional coffee structures have a significantly higher concentration of hexanal than the core of the coffee structures as evidenced by higher hexanal/deuterated hexanal ratio for the surface of the coffee structures (see item (b) above). This difference is identified in the coffee structures of item (b) using both instant coffee types. FIGS. 11 A, 11 B and 11 C are electron micrographs of un-treated roast and ground coffee particles where FIG. 11 A depicts void spaces with sharp edges resulting from the remnants of cell walls of the coffee seed; FIG. 11 B depicts that some portions of the un-coated coffee particulate particles are similarly un-coated; and FIG. 11 C depicts that other portions exhibit an instant coffee coating. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: To test the barrier effects of an instant coffee coating apart from the effect of product form, this experiment places roast and ground coffee into metal tins that are then subjected to accelerated aging using UV light. The tins protect the coffee from light except at the exposed surface. The tins are then assigned to one of four treatments: (i) uncovered with full exposure to UV light; (ii) covered with a metal tin lid; (iii) partially covered with instant coffee coating; and (iv) fully covered with an instant coffee coating. The tins are exposed to UV light for five days and then subjected to sensory and chemical evaluation. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation by expert cuppers and evaluated for stale flavors. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. Results: After five (5) days of aging, it is found that coffee covered with a full coating of instant coffee is not significantly different from coffee covered with a tin lid, thus showing no staling effect for both treatments. Coffee exposed to UV light, or with a partial coating, tastes stale. Matching the sensory results, the level of hexanal in the uncovered samples is significantly higher than in the control or fully coated samples, indicating that the fully coated samples are protected from staling. As shown in FIG. 12 , the hexanal to deuterated hexanal ratio of samples covered with a tin lid (control) or covered with a full coating of instant coffee (covered) are significantly lower than uncovered samples, indicating that less staling had occurred. Coffee Film as a Barrier to Lipid Oxidation in Roast and Ground Coffee: This experiment is designed to test if thin layers of instant coffee could prevent staling of roast and ground coffee. In this experiment, thin layers if instant coffee (covering two ranges of thickness, averaging 45 μm and 258 μm, respectively) are created on a scaffolding of nylon mesh. Layers are created by applying hydrated instant coffee (1:1 w/w with water) to the mesh with a brush. The scaffold is then allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight. The resulting layers of instant coffee are then fixed over trays of roast and ground coffee. Trays are then subjected accelerated aging using UV light. Staling is assessed through sensory evaluation and measurement of chemical staling markers. Samples are subjected to sensory evaluation using expert cuppers. Cuppers assigned each coffee a “papery” flavor score from 0 (no papery) to 10 (extremely high papery) as a measure for staleness. Hexanal levels are measured by purge and trap GC/MS (PT-GC/MS). Before analysis, deuterated hexanal is added to each vial as an internal standard. The instant coffee films are visualized and their thickness measured using ESEM (150× magnification). Thin films averaged 48 μm in thickness (minimum 23 μm), while the thicker films averaged 258 μm in thickness. A nylon mesh is used as a scaffolding to form thin layers of instant coffee. To test the effectiveness of these layers in preventing staling, the mesh scaffolds with and without instant coffee are placed over trays of roast and ground coffee during accelerated aging using UV light. Results: It is found that the instant coffee films (both thicknesses) are able to reduce staling in the roast and ground coffee as assessed though sensory evaluation and measurement of the chemical staling marker hexanal (see FIGS. 13 A and 13 B, respectively). This experiment demonstrates that a thin film of instant coffee is able to confer a protective effect against staling for roast and ground coffee. As illustrated in FIG. 13 A, papery flavor scores for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. As illustrated in FIG. 13 B, the area ratios between hexanal and deuterated hexanal for coffee covered with thin or thick (average thickness 48 μm and 258 μm, respectively) layers of instant coffee are significantly lower than those of uncovered negative controls (neg) or mesh blank controls (mesh) indicating a protective effect of the instant coffee layers. Creating Roast and Ground Particles with Instant Coating: This set of experiments evaluates several different methods of combining at least one roast and ground coffee with a hydrated slurry formed from water and at least one instant coffee (or equivalent) for their ability to form an instant coffee coating on the at least one type of roast and ground coffee (see Table 7 for the various particulars). Coating completeness is evaluated by electron microscopy. The method of forming the coated products of Treatments 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 is discussed in detail below. Each form represents a different means of application that is effective in producing a coating with a coverage within the scope of the present invention as discussed above. As shown in Table 7, different treatments are tested to see if a coating of instant coffee within the scope of the present invention as detailed herein could be applied to roast and ground coffee particles.

Treatment 2—Roast and Ground Coffee with Liquid Coffee Concentrate, small agglomerates: Step (1): Place liquid coffee concentrate (20.0 g liquid coffee concentrate for 100 grams of mix) in a clean stand mixer bowl. Agitate the coffee concentrate at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment (about 0.5 minutes) Step (2): Once the liquid coffee concentrate has begun to coat the mixing bowl, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the liquid coffee concentrate at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts liquid coffee concentrate (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams liquid coffee concentrate). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the liquid coffee concentrate suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and liquid coffee concentrate are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #8 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen. The resulting matrix is then transferred to a drying surface (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). Step (5): The resulting matrix is allowed to dry over night or until excess moisture is removed. Treatment 4—Particulate Air Dried: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) of at least one type of instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until fully mixed (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allowed dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 6—Particulate #16 Sieve: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is transferred to a #16 sieve screen where it is gently pressed through the screen in order to create small agglomerates/particles over a catch tray that can be used for drying (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil). The screening process creates small agglomerates that dry easily at room temperature. Step (5): The resulting mixture is allowed to dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 8—Particulate: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (20.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (20.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (about two to three minutes). Step (2): Once the instant coffee suspension is homogeneous, ADC Brewer Grind Size roast and ground coffee is slowly added to the mixing bowl while continuing to mix at low speed. The roast and ground coffee is combined with the instant coffee slurry at ratio of 60 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts instant coffee to 20 parts processing water (e.g., 60.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 20.0 grams instant coffee and 20.0 grams processing water). Step (3): The roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are mixed using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (4): Once roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Treatment 10—Microgrind: Step (1): Creating the instant coffee suspension is accomplished by combining one part (50.0 grams) instant coffee (e.g., Regular instant Folgers (RIF) pre-agglomeration) with one part processing water of equal mass (50.0 grams) in a clean stand mixer bowl. The instant coffee and water are combined at room temperature using a spatula with gentle agitation. Allow the resulting coffee-water mixture to settle for about 30 minutes. Remove any foam from the top of the instant coffee suspension and retain the de-foamed suspension. Step (2): Combine the de-foamed instant coffee suspension with microgrind roast and ground coffee in a stand mixer bowl at a ratio of 80 parts roast and ground coffee to 20 parts dry instant coffee equivalent (80.0 grams roast and ground coffee to 40.0 grams of instant coffee suspension from Step (1)). Mix microgrind roast and ground coffee and instant coffee suspension using a stand mixer with spatula paddle attachment at low speed until combined (roughly two to three minutes). Step (3): Once the roast and ground coffee and the instant coffee suspension are fully combined, the resulting mixture is spread over a drying tray (e.g., a standard cookie sheet pan lined with aluminum foil) and allow dry over night or until all the excess processing water is removed. Results: The above experiments found that by varying one of several variables, a desired shell formed from one or more types of liquid coffee concentrate or instant coffee, with any desired coverage percentage as disclosed above, could be achieved around individual roast and ground coffee particles (see FIGS. 14 A through 14 E) as evidenced by comparison to uncoated regions of a un-formed coffee particulate coffee ground (see FIG. 15 ). Variables within the scope of the present invention include, but are not limited to, increasing the amount of water in the water/instant coffee mixture, varying the roast and ground particle size, increasing the amount of instant coffee slurry to roast and ground coffee to form the instant coffee/roast and ground mixture, and/or altering the post-mix handling process. More Anti-Staling Working Examples: Multiple experiments to test anti-staling properties of coffee extract coatings are setup and run to analyze the impact of the following: (i) surface area to volume ratio; (ii) instant coffee mass to water ratio; and (iii) use of liquid coffee extract as a coating substance. Accelerated aging using UV light box is utilized for three to four days of aging. Staling of the coffee samples is assessed by expert panelists through independent assessments. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). Impact of Surface Area to Volume Ratio on Staling of Coffee: Two sample types of coffee are prepared to assess the impact of surface area to volume ratio on coffee samples which include (1) loose roast and ground coffee on a tray; and (2) three-dimensional coffee structures prepared from the any one of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein. For item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee the percent of surface area exposed to UV light is controlled with aluminum foil (Al) or sheets of instant coffee film (IF) laid over the roast and ground coffee. The coffee on an uncovered tray has one (top) surface exposed to UV (50 percent of surface area) and one (bottom) surface against the tray bottom (50 percent of surface area). For item (2) the three-dimensional coffee structure (cylindrical shaped) only the top surface of the structure is directly exposed to UV light. Decreasing the mass of the structure changes its height, but does not change its diameter. Further, decreasing the mass of the structure increases the surface area exposed to UV light for a given mass of structures (approximately 34 grams). Both coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: Item (1) the loose roast and ground coffee on a tray started to stale between 75 percent and 85 percent coverage. The instant coffee film (IF) covered coffee samples performed as well as the aluminum foil (Al) covered coffee samples. The three dimensional structures of the present invention discussed herein started to stale between tablets weights of about four gram to two gram target weights. As seen in Table 8, staling of coffee samples discussed above is not detected at a surface to area volume ratio at or below 0.82. Staling is detected at a surface area to volume ratio at or above 1.39. Exposed surface area to volume ratios for preventing staling of any of the coffee compositions prepared by methods discussed herein are at least about 0, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.05, at least about 0.07, at least about 0.10, at least about 0.12, at least about 0.15, at least about 0.17, at least about 0.20, at least about 0.22, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.27, at least about 0.30, at least about 0.32, at least about 0.35, at least about 0.37, at least about 0.40, at least about 0.43 at least about 0.45, at least about 0.48, at least about 0.50, at least about 0.53, at least about 0.55, at least about 0.57, at least about 0.60, at least about 0.62, at least about 0.65, at least about 0.67, at least about 0.70, at least about 0.02, at least about 0.75, at least about 0.77, at least about 0.80, at least about 0.82, at least about 0.84, at least about 0.86, at least about 0.88, at least about 0.90, at least about 0.92, at least about 0.94, at least about 0.96, at least about 0.98, or even at least about 1. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. TABLE 8 Exposed Surface Area Stale Score Treatment to Volume Ratio (1-5) Tray Al 100% covered R & G coffee 0.00 1 Tray Al 97.5% covered R & G coffee 0.32 1 8.5 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 0.42-0.43 1 6.5 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 0.48-0.50 1 Tray Al 95% covered R & G coffee 0.53 2 Tray IF 95% covered R & G coffee 0.53 2 4.0 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 0.77-0.82 2 2.0 g Formed Coffee Product (current invention) 1.39-1.45 3 Tray Al 85% covered R & G coffee 1.58 3 Tray Al 75% covered R & G coffee 2.63 4 Tray uncovered (50% total exposure) R & G coffee 5.26 5 Impact of Instant Coffee Dilution on Staling: Instant coffee is diluted in water at three ratios are analyzed including: (i) 1:1 instant coffee to water; (ii) 1:2 instant coffee to water; and (iii) 1:4 instant coffee to water ratios to understand the target weight percent of instant coffee. The instant coffee dilutions of items (i) through (iii) above are tested on micro grind roast and ground coffee (particle size of about 200 microns or less) and ADC brewer grind size roast and ground coffee (average particle size of about 1000 microns). All treatments of items (i) through (iii) are applied using various methods as discussed herein of the present invention at an 80:20 mix of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee to make coffee compositions of the present invention as discussed herein. The coffee samples are exposed to UV light for four days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the microgrind coffee samples with a more diluted suspension of instant coffee (1:4) to water is more effective at protecting the microgrind coffee from staling than more concentrated suspensions (1:1 or 1:2), which is likely due to increased coating with less dense extract suspension on this grind size. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of three (3) (slightly stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of one (1) (not stale) For ADC brewer grind size, the larger grind size, a more concentrated suspension of instant coffee in water is more effective at protecting the coffee from staling. The larger grind size may absorb the suspension differently than smaller particles. Grind size is critical to determine the target instant coffee dilution (weight percent) for forming the coating. It is determined that different dilutions needed at different grind sizes. For the microgrind a 1:4 dilution is targeted and for the ADC brewer grind size, a 1:1-1:2 dilution is targeted. For the ADC brewer grind size, the negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 1:1 and 1:2 ratio of instant coffee to water received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), and the 1:4 ratio of instant coffee to water received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). Impact of Roast and Ground Coffee to Coffee Extract Ratio on Staling: Three ratios of roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract are analyzed including: (i) 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; (ii) 70:30 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract; and (iii) 60:40 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee extract (all at a weight to weight). Two roast and ground grind sizes of coffee are analyzed for the coating of instant coffee thereof including microgrind and ADC brewer grind size. Liquid coffee concentrate is used to coat the roast and ground coffee. All roast and ground coffee samples are in particulate form. The coated coffee samples are aged under UV light for three days. The samples are then used to brew coffee and assessed for staling by expert panelists where a score of three (3) or greater is considered to indicate staling of the coffee products and brew therefrom (as noted above). Results: For the liquid coffee concentrate coating on microgrind coffee, an increased amount of liquid coffee (60:40 ratio) in the formulation helps prevent staling versus less mass of liquid coffee (80:20 or 70:30 ratios). The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is more effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 60:40 ratio received stale scores of one (1) (not stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of three point five (3.5) (slightly stale to stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of three (3) (slightly stale). For liquid coffee concentrate coating on ADC brewer grind size, an increased amount of liquid coffee (70:30 ratio) staled while application of liquid coffee 20 percent by weight did not. The 60:40 application is too liquid to form particulates and is untestable. The same trend is seen for instant coffee suspensions where a greater volume of a more dilute suspension is less effective. The negative control received a stale score of five (5) (very stale), the 70:30 ratio received a stale score of the five (5) (very stale) and the 80:20 ratio received a stale score of one (1) (not stale). Summary of Anti-Staling Working Examples: The total solids concentration and liquid volume impact the instant coating effectiveness of protecting the roast and ground coffee from staling. Target application of the instant coating on microgrind coffee is an instant coffee dilution of 1:4 instant coffee to water and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for microgrind coffee is a target applied at 60:40 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight). Target application for ADC brewer grind size coffee for instant coffee dilution is about a 1:1 to about a 1:2 instant coffee to water ratio and an instant slurry applied at 80:20 roast and ground coffee to instant coffee (weight to weight). Target weight of liquid coffee concentrate application for ADC brewer grind size coffee is target applied at 80:20 roast and ground to liquid coffee concentrate (weight to weight).

The complete text of these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to structured coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be used in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers can find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. Single serving coffee makers such as those by Hamilton Beach, Cuisinart, Mr. Coffee and others are generally designed to make a single cup of coffee (but can make slightly larger volumes) using a single use ground, or powered, coffee composition. In some instances, the coffee compositions used in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be powered in nature, in other instances the coffee compositions utilized in connection with such single serving coffee makers can be contained in what is typically viewed as a single use coffee “cup.” In this instance, such a coffee “cup” container/structure can contain, but does not require, a built-in filter element that lines the inside surface of such a single “use” coffee cup container/structure. It should be noted that although such coffee cup containers/structures are viewed as single use, the end user or consumer can, and often does, use such single use coffee cups more than once. Other forms of coffee makers and methods for preparing coffee include, but are not limited to, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced whereby various manufacturers provide coffee in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, are provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “containers,” “cups,” and/or “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are really only designed to brew a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tableted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. In light of the above and in view of the current products available in the marketplace, it would be desirable to develop a coffee composition and one or more items made therefrom that utilize a combination of instant coffee with one or more of roast coffee and/or ground coffee to achieve a coffee composition able to achieve a variety of brew amounts while still maintaining the product's integrity in combination with providing faster disassociation when brewed, thereby advantageously providing a variety of consistent coffee products of varying strengths. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided are structured coffee compositions and to various items made using such structured coffee compositions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use one or more of the present embodiments. The general principles described herein can be applied to embodiments and applications other than those detailed below without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Therefore, the present embodiments are not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed or suggested herein. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety as though they are fully set forth herein. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the numerical properties set forth in the following specification and claims are approximations that can vary depending on the desired properties sought to be obtained in embodiments of the present invention. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations; the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported with relative precision. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from error found in their respective measurements. As noted above, the present invention relates to structured coffee compositions and to various items made using such coffee compositions. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to coffee compositions suitable for use in one or more of automatic drip coffee makers, single serving coffee makers, percolating coffee makers, moka pot coffee makers, French press coffee makers, vacuum coffee makers, espresso coffee makers, thermal coffee makers, tea diffusers, pour over brewers or methods thereof, or coffee bar brewers or thermal or glass carafe, cold brew brewers and any methods of preparing cold brew coffee, or any combination of two or more thereof. Terminology Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Non-Coffee Binder” means a material which improves the structural integrity of a coffee composition made in accordance with the present invention. “Non-Coffee Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc., or any one or more binders made from one or more coffee ingredients and some amount of water. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, liquid coffee concentrate, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. Ground roast coffee can also be referred to as “roast coffee, ground coffee, or even a combination of roast coffee and ground coffee”. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Coffee solids” means the coffee constituents that are extracted or extractable during the brewing of coffee. Unless indicated otherwise, the term coffee solids refers to both the dissolved coffee solids and suspended coffee solids (e.g., very small grinds or fines). “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee composition means that the coffee composition is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the composition, when the composition is in place in a brewing device so as to be contacted with water (hot, cold or any temperature therebetween) for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example, flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3 weight percent) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. Furthermore, instant coffee used in the present invention can be prepared by any convenient process, of which a variety of processes are known to those skilled in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Moreover, representative spray drying processes that can provide suitable instant coffee are disclosed in, for example, pages 382 through 513 of Sivetz & Foote, “Coffee Processing Technology,” Vol. I (Avi Publishing Co. 1963), U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,771,343, 2,750,998, and 2,469,553, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Other suitable processes for providing instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,436,227, 3,493,388, 3,615,669, 3,620,756, and 3,652,293, all of which the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. The instant coffee for use in connection with the present invention can be prepared form any single variety of coffees or a blend of different varieties, and can be decaffeinated or un-decaffeinated, and can be processed to reflect a unique flavor characteristic as necessary. Additionally, instant coffee has many forms: spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid. “Liquid coffee concentrate” or “liquid coffee extract” as used herein designates an aqueous extract of the roasted coffee beans wherein the solids content is substantially greater than used for direct consumption as a beverage. The coffee solids content may be from about 10 wt % to about 75 wt %. The term as used here indicates a concentrated coffee extract, irrespective of this being liquid or a solid deep frozen coffee concentrate. As is generally known coffee extracts are recovered by contacting roasted and ground coffee beans with water or an aqueous solution. On an industrial scale, the intention is to achieve high extraction efficiency leading to extraction of aroma substances, that is odorants and flavorings, from the ground coffee. The concentration method is not particularly limited and can be performed by a known method and apparatus, evaporation, membrane concentration, concentration under reduced pressure, freeze concentration, and the like. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3 grams to about 5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to about 5 fluid ounces to about 6 fluid ounces (about 150 mL to about 175 mL) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (about 55 mL) of espresso strength brewed coffee. In one embodiment, the present invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures can be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing can include about 70° C. to about 100° C., about 80° C. to about 99° C., about 85° C. to about 97° C., or about 90° C. to about 96° C. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce anywhere from about 4 to about 12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The coffee products of the present invention can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and can be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. For more information related to ADC brewers see, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition The general inventive concepts encompass various embodiments that are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include ground roast coffee that is bound together with coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. Examples of coffee extracts for use in the solution of coffee extract include, but are not limited to liquid coffee concentrate and instant coffee. Advantageously, the coffee extracts assist in coating and binding the particles of the ground roast coffee together. The structured coffee composition may have a random three-dimensional shape such as an agglomerate or a geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. It has been found that by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure a plurality of ground roast coffee particles in a matrix of coffee extract may be prepared. Through the mixing of the solution of coffee extract with ground roasted coffee, a portion of the ground roasted coffee is extracted. Accordingly, the resultant matrix on the ground roast coffee particles includes a mixture of the coffee extracts and extracts from the ground roast coffee. Stated differently, the coffee extract matrix is composed of compounds that originated from both the coffee exact and roast and ground coffee particles. In one or more embodiments, coffee exact may be prepared from an instant coffee, a liquid coffee concentrate, or a combination thereof. The coffee extract and ground roast coffee extract matrix may simply be referred to as the matrix. In one or more embodiments, where the matrix at least partially surrounds a ground roast coffee particle, the matrix may be referred to as a coating. For the purpose of this specification, ground roast coffee particles that include a coating of the matrix or coffee extract and extract from the round roast coffee may be referred to as the coated ground roast coffee particles. The coating at least partially covers the surface of the ground roast coffee particles and may fill in any cracks or crevices on the surface of the particle. The coating of the ground roast coffee particles may also bind the particles together to form a structured coffee composition. As indicated above, the matrix or coating of the ground roast coffee particles compositionally includes mixture of the coffee extract(s) and extract(s) from the ground roast coffee. This mixture may be experimentally shown via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR analysis shows a peak that corresponds with a wavelength of 940 nm in the coffee coating that is not present in coffee extracts such as those prepared from instant coffee. This peak is high in ground roasted coffee but is present in lower amounts in the coating. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the peak may be related to lipids present in the ground roast coffee, but it may also be a combination of lipids with other compounds that absorb in this region. Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/QTOF) analysis of the coffee coating and ground roast coffee particles, and the coffee extracts may also be used to show compositional differences. For example, coffee extracts such as instant coffee have an extremely low amount of lipids and a different compositional background compared to roast and ground coffee. The presence of high amounts of lipids and/or composition similar to roast and ground coffee but different from instant would indicate a solvent was used. Further, visual appearance of the coating through by surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy or other surface measuring techniques may be used to identify that the coating of coffee extracts was added using a solvent. Visual appearance may also suggest that a solvent was used. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of problems solved, the structured coffee composition advantageously provides a solution to one or more of the following problems: (a) fast disassociation in hot or cold water; (b) the creation of a larger surface area via capillary action creating void spaces due to solution of the instant component; (c) significantly higher percentages brew solids (BS) are achieved with less coffee weight and volume; (d) delivery of improved brew profile and rich color early in brew; (e) consistent results across a full range of brew methods (i.e., ADC, single serve, French Press, cup infuser, cold brew); (f) the structured coffee composition may be prepared with 100 percent coffee or coffee related flavorings/additives; (g) coffee flavor of instant coffee portion of the composition is enhanced by extraction of flavor notes from ground roast component; (h) cold brewing can be achieved with significantly less volumes of coffee and shorter brew times (e.g., four 8.5 gram structured coffee compositions may extract in 1700 milliliters of cold water at about 38.7 to about 42.3° F. in about 2 to about 4 hours or about 2 to about 3 hours for cold brew coffee with a percent brew solids of about 1.0 to about 1.5); and (i) the product stays fresher longer (less staling perception) when stored in low barrier packaging. Ingredients: Ground Roast Coffee As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may be prepared from ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “Arabica(s)”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “Robusta(s)”). See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth in its entirety. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of ground coffees produced from the coffee beans discussed above can be used to make the structured coffee composition. Further, mixtures of two or more different varieties, or types, of ground coffees described above can also be used in combination to prepare the structured coffee composition. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12 weight percent. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology , “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112 to 169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. In other embodiments, the coffee been may be “pre-dried” prior to roasting. In these or other embodiments, the coffee beans may be dried to a moisture content in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Exemplary methods of pre-drying a coffee bean are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,160,757 and 5,322,703 and which are both incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. This drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional or low moisture drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at a temperature in the range of about 70° F. to about 325° F. (21° C. to 163° C.), or from about 90° F. to about 300° F., or from about 120° F. to about 275° F., or even from about 160° F. to about 250° F. over drying times lasting about 1 minute to about 24 hours, or from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, or from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or from about 2 hours to about 12 hours, or from about 3 hours to about 6 hours, or even from about 4 hours to about 5 hours. After drying the green coffee beans (and optionally pre-drying the coffee beans), the coffee beans to are typically processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of the present invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans can be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8° C. to about 371.1° C. (about 350° F. to about 700° F.), or about 176.8° C. to about 260° C. (about 350° F. to about 500° F.), or about 204.4° C. to about 232.2° C. (about 400° C. to about 450° F.), or about 260° C. to about 287.8° C. (about 500° C. to about 550° F.), or about 315.6° C. to about 348.9° C. (about 600° C. to about 660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Here, as well as elsewhere in the specification and claims, individual numerical values, or limits, can be combined to form additional non-disclosed and/or non-stated ranges. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and can, for example, be about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes or about 12 minutes to about 18 minutes, or can be about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 6 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 4 minutes, or about 2 minutes to about 3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and can, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1 minutes to about 3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° F. to about 1200° F. (about 177 C to about 649° C.), or from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, or from about 10 seconds to about 47 seconds. As is well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer ., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee that is used to make the structured coffee composition can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, or from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, or even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as about 250 μm (microns) and as high as about 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of about 400 μm to about 2,500 μm, or from about 500 μm to about 2,400 μm, or from about 650 μm to about 2,200 μm, or from about 800 μm to about 2,000 μm, or from about 900 μm to about 1,800 μm, or from about 1,000 μm to about 1,600 μm, or from about 1,200 μm to about 1,400 μm, or even about 1,300 μm. The coffee beans can be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to about 1.5 mm, or from about 300 μm to about 1,600 μm, or even from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles can be broken down during three-dimensional shape molding, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the molded structure formed from the various coffee compositions described herein. In one or embodiments, the size of the ground roast coffee particles may be described with reference to the size range of the coffee typically employed for a particular brewing method. In one or more embodiments, the ground roast coffee particles may be a coarse grind typically used for French press or percolator coffee brew, for example (e.g., about 900 microns to about 1400 microns), a medium-coarse grind typically used for pour over brewers, flat bottom drip brewer or ADC, or Aeropress, for example, (e.g., about 800 microns to about 1200 microns), a medium grind typically used for clever dripper, café solo, or single serve brewer, for example, (e.g., about 500 microns to about 900 microns), a medium fine grind typically used for Turkish coffee, for example, (e.g., about 200 microns to about 550 microns) or a super fine grind typically used for espresso, or moka pot, for example (e.g., about 200 microns to about 450 microns), or any one or more combinations thereof based on the desired type of coffee beverage and coffee strength. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by full particle size distribution curve. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than about 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. In one or more embodiment the roast ground coffee particles may be prepared using mill flaking. Mill flaking technology or mill flaking is a unique grinding process that creates a larger surface area on each flake for hot water to easily extract more of our coffee flavor. Flaked coffee is further disclosed in for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,676, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/mL to about 0.35 g/mL such as, for example, about 0.263 g/mL, about 0.288 g/mL, about 0.325 g/mL, or even about 0.35 g/mL, if desired. Alternatively, the structured coffee composition can also be made for ground roast coffees having lower or higher densities, if desired. For example, the structured coffee compositions can be made from high density coffees having densities of greater than about 0.40 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of up to about 0.60 g/cm 3 , although even higher densities are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. Similarly, the structured coffee composition can be made from low density coffees having densities of less than about 0.18 g/mL to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , e.g., densities of about 0.18 g/cm 3 to about 0.26 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 to about 0.25 g/cm 3 , or even about 0.22 g/cm 3 to about 0.23 g/cm 3 (such as about 0.19 g/cm 3 , about 0.20 g/cm 3 , about 0.21 g/cm 3 , about 0.22 g/cm 3 , about 0.23 g/cm 3 , about 0.24 g/cm 3 or even about 0.25 g/cm 3 ). Furthermore, the structured coffee composition can be made from higher density coffees having densities from about 0.39 g/cc to about 0.57 g/cc, or from about 0.40 g/cc to about 0.56 g/cc, or from about 0.46 g/cc to about 0.48 g/cc, or even about 0.47 g/cc. In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3.5 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.75 to about 4.25 weight percent. In one instance, the inventive coffee composition can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of about 1.5 weight percent to about 6.6 weight percent, or from about 2.85 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or even from about 4.5 weight percent to about 4.85 weight percent. Generally speaking, the structured coffee composition can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the structured coffee composition can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, in one embodiment it is desirable that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular,” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. In another instance, embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the coffee compositions of the present invention is/are decaffeinated are also within the scope of the present invention. In one or more embodiments, the amount of one or more ground roast coffees (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the structured coffee composition used are in the range of about 65 weight percent to about 90 weight percent, or from about 67.5 weight percent to about 87.5 weight percent, or from about 70 weight percent to about 85 weight percent, or from about 72.5 weight percent to about 82.5 weight percent, or from about 75 weight percent to about 80 weight percent even about 77.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Instant Coffee As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may include instant coffee. The instant coffee may be used to form a slurry in the preparation of the structured coffee composition by adding water to an instant coffee. The slurry is then combined with roast and ground coffee. It has been found that when an instant coffee is included in the structured coffee composition, the instant coffee may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. The presence of instant coffee in coffee compositions and/or structures can be detected by a number of different methods. However, one method is described in R. M. Noyes and C. M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee product to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. See various methods of detecting presence of instant coffee also as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different instant coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the method of which the instant coffee is prepared and other factors. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of less than 7 weight percent, or less than 6.5 weight percent, or less than 6 weight percent, or of less than 5.5 weight percent, or of less than 5 weight percent, or less than 4.5 weight percent, or of less than 4 weight percent, or less than 3.5 weight percent, or of less than 3 weight percent. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may have a moisture content of about 0.5 weight percent to about 7 weight percent, or from about 1 weight percent to about 6.5 weight percent, or from about 1.5 weight percent to about 6 weight percent, or from about 2 weight percent to about 5.5 weight percent, or from about 2.5 weight percent to about 5 weight percent, or from about 3 weight percent to about 4.5 weight percent, or even from about 3.5 to about 4.25 weight percent. Suitable instant coffee for use in the structured coffee composition include, but are not limited to, spray dried powder, agglomerates, freeze dried and liquid instant coffees. In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the yield of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high yield instant coffee, a medium yield instant coffee, or a low yield instant coffee. High yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of greater than 45%. High yields instant coffees may be obtained using a primary and then a secondary extract with high water temperatures. Typically, high yield instant coffees include a high robusta content to maximize extraction yield. Medium yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of between 25% to 45%. Typically, medium yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content with a minimal robusta content. Low yield instant coffees include those instant coffees that are prepared with an extraction of less than 25%. Low yield instant coffees may be obtained using only a primary extraction at temperatures generally at or below 100° C. Typically, low yield instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%). In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee may be characterized by the quality of the instant coffee. The instant coffee may be a high quality instant coffee or a low quality instant coffee. High quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that produce a cup of brewed coffee with an aroma similar to a roast and ground coffee and have a flavor with minimal processed and Carmel notes. Typically, high quality instant coffees include a high Arabica content (up to 100%) and are produced at a low extraction yield. Low quality instant coffees include those instant coffees that have a dull or unexciting flavor that may taste stale. Typically, low quality instant coffees include a high robusta content and are produced at a high extraction yield. In some embodiments a low yield, high quality instant coffee is used. In another embodiment a high yield instant coffee is used. The structured coffee composition may employ a variety and types of instant coffee can be used, including a high yield, high quality instant coffee, a high yield, low quality instant, or a low yield, low quality instant, or one or more combinations thereof any one or more instant coffee varieties and types of instant coffee. Exemplary instant coffees can be used with the present invention to make the coffee composition, including but not limited to, those as shown below in Table 1.

In one or more embodiments, the instant coffee that may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, instant coffees may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on of the total weight of the roast and ground coffee and the coffee extract. Liquid Coffee Concentrate As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may include a liquid coffee concentrate. Liquid coffee concentrates may be purchased commercially or prepared prior to inclusion in the structured coffee composition. It has been found that when a liquid coffee concentrate is included in the preparation of a structured coffee composition, the liquid coffee concentrate may be used as one or more of a binder, a coating aid, a disintegration aid, and a brewing aid. In one or more embodiments, a liquid coffee concentrates may be prepared by concentrating the draw-off stream from a liquid extraction process. This process utilizes hot and/or cool water and and/or steam to extract soluble coffee from roast and ground coffee. The liquid stream may then be concentrated by either thermal evaporation or freeze concentration or an alternate method. The concentrated stream of liquid coffee extract can be utilized to create a slurry, or with a roast and ground coffee with or without adding additional process water. In order to preserve aroma, it may be desirable to remove aromas prior to concentration, and later add aromas back into the concentrate. The aroma collection method is not particularly limited. Examples of such processes can include, but are not limited to steam stripping, distillation, flash evaporation, adsorption, and the like. An exemplary liquid coffee concentrate are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,113,643 which is incorporated herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, a commercially available liquid coffee concentrate may be employed in the structured coffee composition. Liquid coffee concentrate is often sold in frozen form, and may be thawed prior to being combined with roast and ground coffee. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be characterized by the percent of coffee solids in the total volume of the liquid coffee concentrate. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may have coffee solids in an amount of about 10% to about 75%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 15% to about 70%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 20% to about 65%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 25% to about 60%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 30% to about 58%, in other embodiments in an amount of about 35% to about 55%, and in other embodiments in an amount of about 40% to about 50%. The amount of liquid coffee concentrate that may be included in the structured coffee composition should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least property such as binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, and staling resistance. In one or more embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee composition in an amount that will not unduly alter the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In one embodiments, the coffee solids from the liquid coffee concentrate may be included in the structured coffee compositions in the range of about 35 weight percent to about 10 weight percent, or from about 32.5 weight percent to about 12.5 weight percent, or from about 30 weight percent to about 15 weight percent, or from about 27.5 weight percent to about 17.5 weight percent, or from about 25 weight percent to about 20 weight percent or even about 22.5 weight percent, based on the overall weight of the total weight of structured coffee composition. Additional Additives The structured coffee composition may include on or more additional ingredients. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the structured coffee composition (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context). Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included and, surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee products. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290; 6,277,428; 6,090,431; 1,951,357, and EP 813816, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. While binders included in certain embodiments, in other embodiments the structured coffee composition is free of non-coffee binders. In one or more embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added during the step of mixing the one or more ground roast coffee and the solution of one or more coffee extracts. In other embodiments, the additional ingredients may be added to the structured coffee composition (e.g., after the step of drying). Flavorants, both liquid and solid (or dry), can be included in the structured coffee products in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Crème Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. The flavorants that can be used include those known to the skilled artisan, such as natural and artificial flavorants. A solid sweetener such as white granulated sugar may be used in connection with the structured coffee product. Examples of a whitening agent that can be used in connection with the structured coffee products include liquid dairy components and dry dairy components. Other suitable sweeteners that can be used in connection with the structured coffee product are those well known in the art, including both natural and artificial sweeteners, including but not limited to also high intensity sweeteners. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,706,785; 10,182,583; and 10,278,407, which disclose flavorants, sweeteners, and whitening agents for inclusion into the structured coffee products. These patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may be made with one or more layers of additives, for example, coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers on a side of the structured coffee composition (e.g., the top, bottom, or any side or rounded face of the structured coffee composition). In these or other embodiments, the structured coffee composition may include one or more layers that bisect or are situated between two portions of the coffee composition in the structured coffee composition. In other various embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be made with one or more various elements including the coffee composition, flavorant, sweetener, whitener, etc., wherein the structured coffee composition is a homogenous mixture of any one or more of the foregoing included therein. Method of Making a Structured Coffee Composition: As indicated above, the structured coffee composition may be prepared by mixing a solution of coffee extract with ground coffee to form a granulated composition, forming a structure from the granulated composition, and at least partially drying the structure. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract may be prepared from instant coffee. In these or other embodiments, the instant coffee may be mixed with a solvent to prepare the solution of coffee extract. Suitable solvents for used in preparing the solution of coffee extract(s) include, but are not limited to water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, brewed extracts from coffee, tea, juice, carbonated water, nitrogen infused water, and liquid CO 2 , among others. Any suitable method of mixing the instant coffee and the solvent may be used. Generally, the instant coffee and the solvent are mixed until smooth and uniform consistency is achieved. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using an instant coffee may be a slurry. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the weight to weight ratio of the instant coffee to the solvent may be from about 4:1 to about 1:2, in other embodiments from about 3:1 to about 1:1.75, in other embodiments from about 2:1 to about 1:1.5, in other embodiments from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.25, in other embodiments from about 1.15:1 to about 1:15.1, in other embodiments from about 1.1:1 to about 1:1.1, and in other embodiments from about 1.05:1 to about 1:1.05. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes instant coffee may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract(s). In these or other embodiments, the solution of coffee extract(s) that includes instant coffee may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, liquid coffee concentrate may be used as or to prepare the solution of coffee extract. In one or more embodiments, the liquid coffee extract may be used as prepared (i.e. the product of an extraction and an optional concentration). In other embodiments, the liquid coffee concentrate may be diluted with a solvent. In certain embodiments, at higher concentrations, the solution of coffee extract prepared using a liquid coffee concentrate may be a slurry. Regardless, in one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may be described as a weight percent of coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract. In these or other embodiments, the solution of coffee extract that includes a liquid coffee concentrate may include coffee solids in the range of about 3 wt % to about 75 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 5 wt % to about 70 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 10 wt % to about 65 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 15 wt % to about 60 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 20 wt % to about 55 wt %, in other embodiments in the range of about 30 wt % to about 53 wt %, and in other embodiments in the range of about 35 wt % to about 50 wt %. In one or more embodiments, the solution of coffee extracts may include a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. For example, a solution of coffee extracts may be prepped by combining a solution prepared by combining instant coffee and a solvent with a liquid coffee concentrate. In other embodiments, the instant coffee may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate to prepare a solution of coffee extract(s). The ranges and amounts of coffee solids provided for the liquid coffee concentrate may be used in a solution of coffee extracts that includes a mixture of instant coffee and liquid coffee concentrate. The solution of coffee extract(s) may then be combined with a ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Any suitable method of mixing the solution of coffee extract and the ground roast coffee may be used. Suitable mixing device include, but are not limited to stand mixers, spatulas, and paddle mixers. In certain embodiments, the solution of coffee extract may be sprayed on the ground roast coffee to form a granulated composition. Typically, prior to drying the granulated composition may be described as sticky. In one or more embodiments, the amount of solution of coffee extract and the amount of ground roast coffee in the granulated composition may be described as a weight to weight ratio of the weight of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract to the weight of the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the ratio of the coffee solids in the solution of coffee extract to the ground roast coffee may be from about 10:90 to about 40:60, in other embodiments from about 12.5:87.5 to about 37.5:62.5, in other embodiments from about 15:85 to about 35:65, in other embodiments from about 17.5:82.5 to about 32.5:67.5, and in other embodiments from about 20:80 to about 30:70. After the granulated composition it may be formed or otherwise shaped into a structure. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into an agglomerate with a random shape. In other embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed or molded into geometrical shape such as, for example, polyhedrons and curved three-dimensional shapes. In one or more embodiments, the granulated composition may be formed into a structure using a press or a die. Suitable presses include a Carver Press, for example Model #3912. In these or other embodiments, a low amount of pressure or compaction should be employed in the forming of the structure so the resultant structured coffee composition is not completely compressed and includes a level of porosity. For example, a de minimis amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a pressure that slightly exceeds 0 pounds per square inch (PSI). In other embodiments, an amount of pressure may be applied to achieve a compaction of the granulated composition of between 60% and 70%. For example, a portion of the granulation composition may be molded using a target compaction travel on a carver press of 94% which is calculated by taking the amount in millimeters of the 100 percent travel of the die assembly and multiplying by 0.94 to determine the amount of travel in millimeters to achieve a 94% compaction travel target using hand compaction until the target travel is achieved thereby resulting in a compaction of 60 percent to 70 percent of the granulated coffee. After the granulated composition is formed into a structure, it may be dried to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water or other solvents may be removed by air drying, microwave drying, infrared drying, etc. After the drying step a residual amount of water, moisture, or a combination thereof may remain in the structured coffee composition. The solvent content (i.e. water, other solvents, or a combination of water and other solvents) of the of the structured coffee composition may be determined by oven drying coupled with weight analysis to provide the most universal method across solvents, allowing one to measure percent loss of the solvent. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee composition may have a final solvent content of less than about 10 weight percent, less than about 9.75 weight percent, less than about 9.5 weight percent, less than about 9.25 weight percent, less than about 9 weight percent, less than about 8.75 weight percent, less than about 8.5 weight percent, less than about 8.25 weight percent, less than about 8 weight percent, less than about 7.75 weight percent, less than about 7.5 weight percent, less than about 7.25 weight percent, less than about 7 weight percent, less than about 6.75 weight percent, less than about 6.5 weight percent, less than about 6.25 weight percent, less than about 6 weight percent, less than about 5.75 weight percent, less than about 5.5 weight percent, less than about 5.25 weight percent, less than about 5 weight percent, less than about 4.75 weight percent, less than about 4.5 weight percent, less than about 4.25 weight percent, less than about 4 weight percent, less than about 3.75 weight percent, less than about 3.5 weight percent, less than about 3.25 weight percent, less than about 3 weight percent, less than about 2.75 weight percent, less than about 2.5 weight percent, less than about 2.25 weight percent, less than about 2 weight percent, less than about 1.75 weight percent, less than about 1.5 weight percent, less than about 1.25 weight percent, or even less than about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the coffee composition and/or structure present. In one or more embodiments, the water content of the structured coffee composition may be described in reference to the water content of the ingredients used to form the structured coffee composition. In one or more embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the ground roast coffee employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. In still other embodiments, water content of the structured coffee composition may be within 15%, in other embodiments within 10%, and in other embodiments within 5% of the water content of the combination of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee (i.e. the percent of water in the combined amount of the instant coffee and ground roast coffee) employed to prepare the structured coffee composition. For example, if a structured coffee composition is prepared with a ground roast coffee and an instant coffee that both have an initial water content of 3%, the structured coffee composition may have a water content with 15% of 3% (i.e., 2.55% to 3.45%). Coating Characteristics As indicated above, the coated coffee particles include a coating that compositionally includes a mixture of the coffee extract(s) and extract(s) from the ground roast coffee.

In one or more embodiments, the coating may be characterized by the amount of the surface of the coffee particle that is coated by the coating that includes a mixture of the coffee extract and extract from the ground roast coffee. In one or more embodiments, the average surface area coverage of the coffee particle is in the range of about 50 percent to 100 percent, about 52.5 percent to 97.5 percent, or from about 55 percent to about 95 percent, or from about 57.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, or from about 60 percent to about 90 percent, or from about 62.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, or from about 65 percent to about 85 percent, or from about 67.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, or from about 70 percent to about 80 percent, or from about 72.5 percent to about 77.5 percent, or even about 75 percent of the exposed surface area of the coffee particle. Composition Size and Configuration: Although the structured coffee compositions may be made in any size and/or three-dimensional geometric shape, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produce a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, an structured coffee may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and can optionally be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to break any coffee structure made from the one or more coffee compositions into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e., break a molded product/pellet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as one-half of a standard serving, or one-third of standard serving, or one-quarter of standard serving. The end user/consumer may add or reduce the number of coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference, to achieve brewed coffee that is weaker or stronger than normal. Since, in one embodiment, the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. See for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; and 9,474,290, which disclose methods of adjusting the weakness or strength of a standard brewed coffee, the entire disclosures of all of these patents are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entireties. Furthermore, about one (1) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about one (1) cup of coffee; or about three (3) standard servings of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or about four (4) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or even about five (5) standard serving of coffee compositions or coffee structure product may make about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of dimensions, the process and ingredients the structured coffee composition may have a cylindrical structure measuring about 29 mm to about 33 mm in diameter and about 19.5 mm to about 32 mm in thickness and about 14.0 cm3 to about 27.0 cm3 in volume, which can have variations thereabout as further described below and shown in FIG. 2 , and Tables 2, 3, and 4. The diameter and thickness can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm. In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 6.5 grams, about 7.5 grams, about 8.5 grams, about 10.5 grams, or even about 12.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 13 grams, about 15 grams, about 17 grams, about 21 grams, or even about 25 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 19.5 grams, about 22.5 grams, about 25.5 grams, about 31.5 grams, or even about 37.5 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. In other embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a weight of 26 grams, about 30 grams, about 34 grams, about 42 grams, or even about 50 grams, which can have variations thereabout of plus or minus 0.1 grams to 0.5 grams. Similarly, structured coffee compositions made with different dose sizes, e.g., a coffee product made to produce one-third of a standard serving of brewed coffee per structure or molded product, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different structure configurations for the structured coffee composition are also possible. For example, cylinder, cube, cuboid, sphere, pellet, ellipsoid, triangular pyramid, hexagonal prism, truncated triangular pyramid, truncated square pyramid, hexagonal pyramid, truncated hexagonal pyramid, cone, truncated cone, diamond, a three dimensional shape with an oval-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with heart-shaped face, a three dimensional shape with triangle-shaped face, or pillow shape are contemplated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical molded structure can, if so desired, be concave or convex. Additionally, or alternatively, the outer surface of a structure or molded product can have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Further, the structured coffee compositions may be in the form of a particulate or an agglomeration of particles. See FIG. 1 for examples of structural shapes. It should also be noted that comparative examples are shown in some tables and figures herein, which can be labeled “Tablet Example”. The comparative example, “Tablet Example”, is a coffee tablet made using a multi-step compaction process as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Resistance to Staling In one or more embodiments, the structured coffee compositions may have a resistance to staling or a reduced perception of staling. Resistance to staling may be measured through the quantification of lipid oxidation byproducts, such as hexanal, that are known to be generated during coffee staling and contribute to the perception of stale coffee particulate or products. Reduced perception of staling in roasted coffee particulate or products by the end user (consumer) once brewed, can be measured though the use of a trained sensory panel calibrated to identify stale notes, such as “papery,” in a coffee brew. Advantageously, the structured coffee compositions may protect coffee flavor from one or more negative organoleptic effects, such as development of paper off-notes, of staling, especially those staling effects caused by lipid oxidation. In one embodiment, this is accomplished via the use of a coated coffee particulate or product (i.e., roasted and ground coffee or coffee structures formed from a roasted and ground coffee particulate or product that has been coated in any manner discussed herein) which may limit exposure of such a coffee particulate or product to environmental conditions that cause or result in enhanced lipid oxidation. In addition, the structured coffee compositions minimize surface area to volume ratios for coffee particulate or products that will be exposed to oxidative forces, further minimizing lipid oxidation and staling thereof. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by exposing structured coffee compositions to UV light for a period of 4 days in a UV light box. After the exposure to UV light, the structured coffee compositions may be brewed and assessed by expert panelists for staling. The trained expert panelists score the staling of the coffee based on a scale from 1 (not stale) to 5 (very stale), where scores 3 or above are recognized as staling of the coffee samples. For example, the following descriptors apply to the scores: 1 (Not Stale); 2 (Very Slight Off Note); 3 (Slight Stale); 4 (Stale); and 5 (Very Stale). The staling data may be reported along with the exposed surface area (i.e., the area of the surface that is exposed to light divided by the total volume of the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.5, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 1. Stated differently, the brewed coffee is perceived as not stale. In one or more embodiments, when the structured coffee compositions have an exposed surface to area volume ratio of less than 0.82, the coated coffee particles or structured coffee compositions may be used to prepare a brewed coffee that achieves stale score of 2. Stated differently the brewed coffee is perceived to have a very slight off note. In one or more embodiments, staling may be determined by aging the coffee under UV lights and testing determining the hexanal content. The coffee may be aged by exposing the structured coffee compositions formed from the coated coffee particles to UV light for a period of 7 days. After the exposure to UV light, the structured coffee compositions may be brewed and the amount of hexanal may be determined. In one or more embodiments, the amount of hexanal after a week of exposure of light in the coated coffee particles may be less than 40 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g, in other embodiments less than 30 ng/g, other embodiments less than 25 ng/g, and in other embodiments less than 35 ng/g. Packaging and Use: The structured coffee compositions are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages and/or packaging. Due to the resistance to staling of the structured coffee compositions, they allow for reduction of packaging materials and lowers packaging cost. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; woven and nonwoven filter paper, a nylon mesh material, boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. Moreover, the instant coated slurry and/or liquid coffee concentrate can even be used to coat the inside of a package or packaging material for the coffee compositions and/or coffee structures thereof. If desired, the structured coffee compositions can be packaged in any desired number so that each packaged amount can be designed to yield any desired number of brewed coffee servings and/or strengths. For example, structured coffee compositions are in one embodiment designed to produce a single serving of coffee per coffee composition and/or structures thereof can be packaged individually to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, in groups of two to facilitate making two cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of three to facilitate making three cups of coffee in a single brew, in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle and so forth up to groups of twelve to facilitate making twelve cups of coffee in a single brew. The structured coffee compositions may be packaged with more or less of the same to produce stronger or weaker coffee for a standard brew of coffee since, in one embodiment, the coffee structures (e.g., pellets, molded products, etc.) can be designed to be dividable, any potentially desired ratio of coffee structures to standard coffee servings can potentially be achieved. Furthermore, in yet other embodiments designed to produce a single serving of coffee per structured coffee composition can be packaged individually as structured coffee composition to facilitate making one cup of coffee in a single brew, or can be packaged in a group of three (3) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about two (2) to three (3) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of about four (4) structured coffee compositions to facilitate making about four (4) to seven (7) cups of coffee; or can be packaged in a group of even about five (5) structured coffee compositions coffee to facilitate making about eight (8) to twelve (12) cups of coffee. The packaging for the structured coffee compositions may be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the structured coffee compositions are periodically used by the consumer, the unused structured coffee compositions that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. One advantage is that two or more structured coffee compositions may be, via two different coffee compositions or structures formed from each respective different structured coffee composition, combined in the same brew to produce a preferred brew in which the one or more properties resulting from the combination of different coffee compositions or structures provide a desired variation, change or combination in flavor, strength, caffeine content, or other such characteristic in the preferred brew. A wide variety of types of structured coffee compositions can be provided together in a pre-packaged kit, or in a consumer selected array, to facilitate preparation of a preferred brew specific to an individual consumer's preferences. As such, an exemplary kit may include a plurality of varied structured coffee compositions, with at least two of the varied structured coffee compositions having a different predetermined property, such as, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, level of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee, or type, of coffee bean treatment. Such a kit can be provided with instructions for combining the two or more types of coffee composition to prepare a desired brewed coffee. These instructions may include one or more “recipes” for preparing one or more special predetermined blends of coffee. The present invention may be packaged as coffee compositions (if in loose powdered form) and/or as an appropriate number of structured coffee compositions. See various methods of packaging and use of coffee compositions and products as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,756,869; 9,603,376; 9,474,291; 9,474,290, which these patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein in their entirety. Structured Coffee Composition Properties: In accordance with the present invention, the structured coffee compositions are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with brewing water of a desired and/or suitable temperature (any temperature could be used, e.g., 1° C. to 100° C., as both hot and cold coffee brews are desirable) at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated herein. The strength/robustness of the structured coffee compositions may conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a product's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the structure in an axial direction over the height of the structure or across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure. Product hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the structure is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the structure breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the structure to break is taken as the hardness of the structure, which is sometimes referred to as the “structure crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. As shown in Table 2 below and FIGS. 3 A and 3 B, the structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the height or axial direction of the structure in the range of about 21.3 N (Newtons) to about 61.7 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 20 N to about 65 N, about 22.5 N to about 62.5 N, about 25 N to about 60 N, about 27.5 N to about 57.5 N, about 30 N to about 55 N, about 32.5 N to about 52.5 N, about 35 N to about 50 N, about 37.5 N to about 47.5 N, about 40 N to about 45 N or even about 42.5 N. The structured coffee compositions may be made to have a hardness with a structure crushing strength over the across the diameter over the radial or longitudinal direction of the structure in the range of about 11.1 N (Newtons) to about 51.6 N, when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses in the range of about 10 N to about 52.5 N, about 12.5 N to about 50 N, about 15 N to about 45 N, about 17.5 N to about 42.5 N, about 20 N to about 40 N, about 20 N to about 37.5 N, about 22.5 N to about 35 N, about 25 N to about 32.5 N, or even about 30 N.

For convenience, the friability of the structured coffee compositions can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating the structure in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these structures that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The structures should not be broken to obtain the weight of the structure in grams, but adjust the number of whole structures to come as close as possible to weight of the structure in grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of structures represents the friability of these structures. As shown in Table 3 below and in FIG. 4 , it has been found that the structured coffee compositions can have a friability in the range of about 50 to 55 percent to about 100 percent (total disintegration of the coffee structure), of about 57.5 percent to about 97.5 percent, of about 60 percent to about 95 percent, of about 62.5 percent to about 92.5 percent, of about 65 percent to about 90 percent, of about 67.5 percent to about 87.5 percent, of about 70 percent to about 85 percent, of about 72.5 percent to about 82.5 percent, of about 75 percent to about 80 percent, or even about 77.5 percent.

Water activity may be determined using a water activity meter such as a Rotronic Hygrolab Water Activity Meter. In one or more embodiments, structured coffee compositions may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. Furthermore, as shown in Table 4 (water activity data) above, the structured coffee compositions having the above combination of properties of about stated values and/or within claimed ranges for hardness, friability, and density within the diameter and height measurements and the about stated target weights may have a water activity of about 0.35 to about 0.42, about 0.36 to about 0.41, about 0.37 to about 0.40, and to about 0.38 to about 0.39, or even about 0.385. It has been further found that the structured coffee compositions achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise conventional ground roast coffee composition. That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the structured coffee composition is used in a typical ADC coffee maker or other brewing devices than when the same amount of conventional ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. This feature is illustrated in the following Working Examples, Examples #1 through #4, Tables 5, 7, 8, 10 through 12, and as shown in FIGS. 6 through 9 , which show that the yield ratios provided by the structured coffee compositions, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the structured coffee compositions relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of conventional ground roast coffee (e.g., the ground roast coffee used to prepare the structured coffee composition) is normally greater than about 1 and in many instances greater than about 1.1, greater than about 1.2, greater than about 1.25, greater than about 1.5, greater than about 1.75, greater than about 2, greater than about 2.25, greater, than about 2.5, greater than about 2.75, and even about 3 on a weight basis. As discussed herein, various particle sizes for the roast and ground coffee may be used, which may result in various percent brew solids, density, and percent porosity in the molded product. Porosity is measured by Micro-CT (also called microtomography or micro-computed tomography). In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity (i.e., percent of total volume) in the structured coffee compositions may greater than 40%, greater than 42.5%, greater than 45% or greater than 47.5%, or greater than 50%, or greater than 52.5%, or greater than 55%, or greater than 57.5%, or greater than 60%. In one or more embodiments, the percent porosity in the structured coffee compositions may range between from about 40% to about 80%, or from about 42.5% to about 77.5%, or from about 45% to about 75%, or from about 47.5% to about 72.5%, or from about 50% to about 70%, or from about 52.5% to about 67.5%, or from about 55% to about 65%, or from about 57.5% to about 62.5%, or even about 60%. See FIGS. 12 A through 13 B for depictions of cross sections of cylindrical and spherical molded products of exemplary embodiments of the structured coffee compositions which depicts the Micro-CT of the porosity in structured coffee compositions. Various samples of structures with various particle size distribution of roast and ground coffee, shapes, and grind sizes were studied as shown below in Tables 5 and 6 below.

For measurement of the percent (%) brew solids (% BS) used herein the refractive index (RI) is measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. Then a linear regression equation is developed and used to correlate the RI to % BS. WORKING EXAMPLES Working Example 1: Automatic Drip Coffee (ADC) maker examples were completed with the present invention and its various constituents for determining the amount of brew solids present in the coffee brew. For all ADC brew methods 1420 mL of PUR filtered tap water was used. Molded or formed coffee structures/products used four 8.5 gram pellets (34 grams in total) of the structured coffee compositions (made with Folgers Classic roast and ground coffee and Colcafe PMD instant coffee), Folgers Classic roast and ground used 34 grams, and Colcafe PMD instant coffee used 6.8 grams for the various coffee brews thereof. The first brewing method took data points every 2 minutes throughout the duration of the brew, i.e., cumulative brew cycles, which is shown in Table 7 and FIG. 6 . Samples were taken by cycling beakers under the drip spout. Total weight of each beaker was taken prior to collecting a sample. A total of 3 replicates were collected using this method. This method was used to show the extraction strength of a brew at each time point and to demonstrate the total strength of the brew as the extraction time increases.

Molded or formed coffee structures/products used the structured coffee compositions made with Folgers Classic roast and ground and Colcafe PMD instant coffee for the various coffee brews thereof. There were about ten (N=10) replicates of each coffee structure that were analyzed for percent brew solids (% BS or percent (%) brew solids). The refractive index (RI) of the brewed coffee sample was measured using Bellingham Stanley RFM 340+, temperature set to 29. RI is the raw data value that is generated by the refractometer, it is used to calculate percent (%) brew solids. The percent (%) brew solids was calculated using the following equation percent (%) brew solids=(RI*549.209)-731.575. See Tables 8 and 9, and FIG. 7 .

For all single serve brew methods, the examples were completed on the standard cup setting using PUR filtered tap water. Molded or formed coffee structures/products used one 8.5 gram pellet (made from Folgers Classic roast and ground and Colcafe PMD instant coffee), one 8.5 gram Folgers Classic roast and ground pellet, or 1.7 grams Colcafe PMD of instant coffee. The first brew method took individual samples in 10 second intervals throughout the duration of the brew cycle, i.e., cumulative brew cycles, which is shown in Table 10 and FIG. 8 . Total weight of each beaker was taken prior to collecting a sample. A total of 3 replicates were conducted using this method. This method was used to show the extraction strength of a brew at each time point. The second brew method brewed coffee structures at incremental extraction times, the extraction was stopped at 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds, i.e., individual brew lengths, which is shown in Table 12. For each time point a new brew was run. Whereas with the previous method multiple samples were taken per brew, with this method only one data point was taken per brew. A single replicate was used for this method. This method was used to demonstrate the total strength of the brew as the extraction time increases.

Conventional cold brew formulations used the Dunkin Donuts' Cold Brew retail formula for the control samples. The present invention used the Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew retail formula for roast and ground and Colcafe PMD instant coffee for the quick cold brew (QCB) formulations. Two different quick cold brew tests examples were run, one using ten (10) 8.5 gram target weight invention structures and the other using four (4) 8.5 gram target weight invention structures. The coffee was encased in standard filter paper pods for brewing. The ten count brew process yielded a coffee that was deemed too strong flavor-wise for most people and is better over ice. The four count brew process with a brew time of 2 hours yielded a coffee that was preferred by people in terms of strength, smooth taste, and character. The present invention when used for quick cold brew coffee provides a bold cold brew coffee strength to remain bold when served over ice. It uses less coffee and brews in a shorter time frame than conventional cold brew formulations to provide a consistent brew. The percent brew solids for the cold brew tests are shown in Table 13 below. Cold brew disassociation examples were also performed as well. A large pitcher was filled with 1700 ml of PUR filtered room temperature water. For the present invention, eight (8) pellets were weighed out for a total of approximately 70 grams, 70 grams for roast and ground, and 13.6 grams for instant coffee. The coffee was encased in standard filter paper pods for brewing. Each sample steeped for a total time of 3 hours with extractions taken at every 30 minute period for percent brew solids (% BS) analysis. A total of 3 replicates were conducted using this method. The present invention used for cold brew coffee disassociates and brews rapidly in both room temperature and cold water applications, which is shown in Table 14 and FIG. 9 . The present invention disassociates in hot water (196.5-202° F.) in about 15 to about 21 seconds, in room temperature water (72-72.3° F.) in about 1 minute 7 seconds to about 1 minute 24 seconds, and in cold water (38.7-42.3° F.) in about 2 minutes 51 seconds to about 4 minutes 12 seconds.

The results showed in Table 15 that all the brewed coffee samples, which were done in triplicate, yielded over 1.0 percent brew solids in the final cup. This shows that the current invention yields a stronger cup on average with respect to soluble brew solids, as compared to current roast and ground products. These current products will yield closer to an average of 0.65 percent to 0.95 percent brew solids in the same brewing methods. TABLE 15 Sample Oz.

The follow list of coffee products were used to produce the various coffee brews tested by the panelists: (a) Folgers Classic Roast R&G at standard drop weight (30.5 grams) (FOL 30.5 grams); (b) Folgers Classic Roast R&G at drop weight matching present invention drop weight (34.0 grams) (FOL 34 grams); (c) Present Invention (4×8.5 gram structures)−80 percent Folgers Classic R&G+20 percent Colcafe Instant (Invention); (d) Folgers Instant Crystals (14.2 grams) (Fol Inst); and (e) Colcafe Instant (14.2 grams)−Low Yield High Quality Instant (Colcafe). All products were brewed in Mr. Coffee ADC brewers in 1420 mL H2O at a temperature of about 157° F.+/−1° F. The panels were run blind and randomized. These products were evaluated and compared over a number of different coffee flavor attributes. It was determined that the present invention had the most coffee “Body”, such as heaviness, mouthfeel, consistency, and/or weight as it coated the tongue of the panelists. Further, Body, is the feeling of the consistency of the liquid related to the amount of extraction of the solids or any other additives that increase the viscosity (References: heaviness on tongue, fullness of mouthfeel). As shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 , the present Invention most closely tracks the attributes of a conventional roast and ground coffee (both Folgers Classic roast and ground coffees) even with a mixture of instant coffee therein with the roast and ground.

These applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a coffee roasting apparatus comprising a compartment for holding coffee beans; a roasting element for roasting the coffee beans in said compartment; and a controller for controlling the roasting element. The present invention further relates to a coffee brewing apparatus comprising such a coffee roasting apparatus. The present invention yet further relates to a method of roasting coffee beans, the method comprising heating the coffee beans to roast the coffee beans. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coffee has become one of the most popular beverages in modern society, with many different types and flavours of coffee being routinely available to a consumer, either in outlets such as coffee shops or in supermarkets for domestic use. The evolution of the popularity of coffee as a beverage has caused a shift in how coffee is being consumed, for instance in domestic settings. Whereas in the past coffee would be predominantly brewed from instant coffee granules or from packaged ground coffee powders, e.g. using domestic coffee makers such as espresso machines or filter machines, nowadays a greater emphasis is placed on the freshness of the brewed coffee, which has triggered a rise in popularity of coffee roasting apparatuses. In such an apparatus, fresh, i.e. green, coffee beans can be roasted by a thermal process, e.g. using hot gases or by physical contact with a hot surface. During roasting at temperatures above 170° C., drying takes place, water is redistributed, and complex chemical reactions such as Maillard reaction and pyrolysis are induced. A fresh coffee powder can then be formed by grinding the freshly roasted coffee beans, thereby facilitating the brewing of fresh coffee. Such coffee is typically considered to have a superior taste compared to coffee brewed from packaged ground coffee powders. The control of such a coffee roasting process is however far from trivial. Different users may require a different degree of roasting, e.g. a light roast or dark roast, of the coffee beans to cater for their personal taste. Moreover, different varieties of coffee beans will require different roasting times in order to achieve a certain roasting degree. Indeed, even different harvests of the same variety of coffee beans may exhibit variability in the required roasting times to achieve the desired degree of roasting. Therefore, one of the major challenges in providing a coffee roasting apparatus is to ensure that the roasted product meets customer expectation; e.g. has the desired degree of roasting. Existing coffee roasting apparatuses such as the Nesco® Model CR-1000 Series of coffee roasters allow the user to specify the roasting time of the coffee beans in order to achieve the desired roasting result. Other roasting apparatuses offer control over the roasting process by allowing the user to specify the roasting temperature. However, as indicated above, it has been found that the desired roasting degree cannot be consistently achieved by (only) controlling the roasting time and/or temperature. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention seeks to provide a coffee roasting apparatus that may produce roasted coffee beans in a more consistent manner. The present invention further seeks to provide a coffee brewing apparatus comprising such a coffee roasting apparatus. The present invention yet further seeks to provide a method of roasting coffee beans in a more consistent manner. According to an aspect, there is provided a coffee roasting apparatus comprising a compartment for holding coffee beans; a roasting element for roasting the coffee beans in said compartment; and a controller for controlling the roasting element, wherein the controller is adapted to control the roasting element as a function of a change in the volume of the coffee beans residing in the compartment, wherein the controller is adapted to control the roasting element ( 140 ) in response to said change of volume exceeding a predefined threshold, said defined threshold indicating first cracking of said coffee beans. The inventors have realized that in a coffee roasting process the variability in the time required to achieve the desired level of roasting is related to the variability in the time of first cracking of the coffee beans. This first cracking occurs as a result of heat-induced changes to the coffee bean structure including pore formation within the coffee bean, which is associated with a significant increase in the volume of the coffee bean. After first cracking, the further roasting of the coffee bean has been found to be highly predictable using simple mathematical models. Therefore, by directly or indirectly monitoring the significant volume changes associated with the first cracking of the coffee beans, improved control over the reproducibility of the coffee roasting process within the coffee roasting apparatus of the present invention is achieved. The controller may be adapted to control the roasting element in response to a monitored rate of change of volume as (a change in) the rate of change of volume can be particularly indicative of the occurrence of first cracking. Specifically, the controller may be adapted to control the roasting element in response to an increase in the monitored rate of change of volume indicative of the start of first cracking of the coffee beans; and/or a decrease in the monitored rate of change of volume indicative of the completion of first cracking of the coffee beans. In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus further comprises a sensor arrangement for determining an unoccupied volume of the compartment, wherein the controller is adapted to control the roasting element in response to the sensor arrangement. As the overall compartment volume is constant, any change (reduction) in the head space over the coffee beans in the compartment can therefore be directly associated with an increase in the volume of the coffee beans in the compartment. To this end, the sensor arrangement may comprise a sensor adapted to transmit a signal into the compartment towards said coffee beans and to detect a reflection of said signal. From the detected reflection, a time-of-flight of the signal for instance may be derived, which can be translated into a distance the signal has travelled through the compartment, which distance is a measure of the aforementioned head space. Such a signal for instance may be an optical signal or an acoustic signal. The sensor arrangement may be adapted to determine an initial volume occupied by said coffee beans and to monitor a change in said initial volume to facilitate detection of the first cracking phase of the coffee beans during roasting. This for instance may be achieved by monitoring changes in the time-of-flight of the signal or by transmitting a plurality of signals at different height levels of the compartment and monitoring which of the transmitted signals can travel (horizontally) across the compartment, i.e. which signals are not blocked by the coffee bean level in the compartment. In this embodiment, changes in the coffee bean level will be detected by a different (smaller) number of signals being able to travel across the compartment. Once the first cracking stage has been identified by monitoring the volumetric changes in the coffee beans, the remainder of the roasting process may be controlled by monitoring volumetric changes or by alternative methods. In an example embodiment, the controller may be adapted to enable the roasting element for a predefined time period upon said change in volume reaching a predefined value. In another example embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a further sensor arrangement for detecting a weight and/or colour change in the coffee beans, wherein the controller is adapted to control the roasting element as a function of said change in the volume and said weight and/or colour change. This may under certain conditions improve the control over the roasting process as the volume changes in the coffee beans upon completion of the first cracking phase of the roasting process are more modest, such that these volume changed may be difficult to accurately detect, for instance if the coffee roasting apparatus contains a small amount of coffee beans only. The coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a user interface for defining a degree of roasting of the coffee beans, the controller being responsive to the user interface. This allows a user of the coffee roasting apparatus to precisely define the desired degree of roasting of the coffee beans. In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a data storage element for storing a measured change in an unoccupied volume in the compartment as a function of time to define a roasting profile of a type of coffee beans, wherein the controller is adapted to program said data storage element. Such a roasting profile may be relied upon during subsequent use of the coffee roasting apparatus with the same type of coffee beans, e.g. to improve the roasting process of the beans. For instance, the controller may be adapted to control the roasting element in accordance with the stored roasting profile in response to a user defining a degree of roasting for said type of coffee beans. This ensures that the beans are exposed to an optimized roasting profile, thereby improving the quality of the roast. In an embodiment, the controller may be adapted to disable the roasting element upon the change in volume exceeding a defined threshold. As the change in volume can be directly correlated to the degree of roasting, such automatic disabling prevents the coffee beans from being too darkly roasted. The coffee roasting apparatus may further comprise a data communication device for communicating detected volume change data to a remote device. This for instance facilitates the collection of roasting data from various coffee roasting apparatuses, which can be used to develop more accurate (averaged) coffee roasting profiles for different types of coffee beans. In an embodiment, the compartment comprises an inlet; and the roasting element comprises a hot air source coupled to said inlet; the coffee roasting apparatus further comprising a stirring element mounted in said compartment for stirring the coffee beans during the roasting process. Such a hot air roasting process has been found particularly effective when combined with the volumetric change detection principle of the present invention. In accordance with another aspect, there is provided a coffee brewing apparatus including the coffee roasting apparatus according to one or more of the aforementioned embodiments. Such a coffee brewing apparatus benefits from the improved consistency of the coffee roasting apparatus, thereby providing a coffee brewing apparatus that can brew coffee with an improved consistency in taste. According to yet another aspect, there is provided a method of roasting coffee beans, the method comprising heating the coffee beans to roast the coffee beans; monitoring a volume change of the coffee beans during said heating; and terminating said heating in response to said volume change exceeding a defined threshold, said defined threshold indicating first cracking of said coffee beans. Such a roasting method is capable of producing roasted coffee beans in a particularly consistent manner, providing excellent control over the level of roasting of the coffee beans. Monitoring a volume change of the coffee beans during said heating may comprises monitoring a rate of change of said volume. Specifically, monitoring a rate of change of said volume may comprise monitoring an increase in the monitored rate of change of volume indicative of the start of first cracking of the coffee beans; and/or monitoring a decrease in the monitored rate of change of volume indicative of the completion of first cracking of the coffee beans. Terminating said heating in response to said volume change exceeding a defined threshold may comprise terminating said heating after a predefined period of time upon said volume change exceeding the defined threshold in order to complete the coffee bean roasting process in a consistent manner.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS It should be understood that the Figures are merely schematic and are not drawn to scale. It should also be understood that the same reference numerals are used throughout the Figures to indicate the same or similar parts. FIG. 1 schematically depicts a coffee roasting apparatus 100 according to an embodiment. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 typically comprises a compartment 110 for storing coffee beans 10 therein. The compartment 110 may further comprise a stirring arrangement including stirring members, e.g. agitating blades, 116 mounted on or otherwise affixed to a stirring bar 114 to stir the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process of the coffee beans. This stirring arrangement assists in ensuring a homogeneous roasting of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . The stirring arrangement may be controlled in any suitable manner, for instance by a controller 130 , which will be explained in further detail below. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 typically further comprises a heating arrangement for heating the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process. In an embodiment, the heating arrangement may be controlled by the controller 130 . The heating arrangement ensures that the coffee beans 10 are heated to an appropriate temperature at which the roasting of the coffee beans 10 takes place, i.e. an appropriate temperature at which the desired chemical reactions such as the Maillard reaction and pyrolytic reactions take place. In FIG. 1, the heating arrangement is embodied by a hot air generator 140 connected to an inlet 112 of the compartment 110 via a conduit 142 by way of non-limiting example only. In this embodiment, the inlet 112 is typically arranged such that the hot air is guided through the coffee beans 10 during the roasting process, e.g. when stirring the coffee beans 10 using the stirring arrangement. The inlet 112 may comprise a fine grid or the like to prevent coffee beans 10 from entering the conduit 142 . However, it should be understood that any suitable heating arrangement for heating the coffee beans 10 may be used, such as one or more heating elements attached to or integrated into the one or more walls of the compartment 110 , in which case the inlet 112 may be omitted. As such heating arrangements are well-known per se, they will not be explained in further detail for the sake of brevity only. The controller 130 is adapted to control the heating arrangement at least partially in response to a change in the volume of the coffee beans 10 residing in the compartment 110 during the roasting process. In an embodiment, in order to facilitate such a control mechanism, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may comprise a sensor arrangement 120 including a transmitter 122 and a receiver 124 , which may be mounted in any suitable location of the compartment 110 , e.g. in the roof or lid of the compartment 110 . The operation of this sensor arrangement will be explained in more detail with the aid of FIG. 2. The transmitter 122 of the sensor arrangement 120 is typically arranged to transmit a signal 121 towards the coffee beans 10 , with the receiver 124 of the sensor arrangement 120 typically arranged to detect a reflection 123 of the transmitted signal 121 . This reflection 123 is typically generated when the signal 121 has travelled the head space over the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 , where the signal 121 is reflected by the coffee beans 10 and as such is an indication of the head space, i.e. the height H of the free volume, in the compartment 110 over the coffee beans 10 . An increase in the volume of coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 during the roasting process caused by the expansion of the coffee beans 10 as indicated by the transition from the left panel to the right panel in FIG. 2 will lead to a reduction of the free volume or head space, i.e. a reduction of the height H to H′, this reduction in head space can be determined from a reduction of the time-of-flight of the signal 121 and its reflection 123 from the transmitter 122 to the receiver 124 : H=(V*t)/2 wherein V is the signal speed and t is the time-of-flight of the signal 121 and its reflection 123 . As the head space can be associated with a volume V head of the compartment 110 , the total volume V tot of the compartment 110 can be expressed as V tot =V beans +V head , wherein V beans is the volume portion of the compartment volume occupied by the coffee beans 10 . As any change, i.e. reduction, in the measured head space volume V head is caused by a change in the coffee bean volume V beans , the measured V head can be directly translated into the coffee bean volume: V tot −V head =V beans , given that the total volume V tot of the compartment 110 is typically known. In other words, H˜V head , such that the determination of H can de directly translated into V head . Therefore, in an embodiment the sensor arrangement 120 is arranged to periodically determine the time-of-flight of the signal 121 and its reflection 123 such that the volume change in the coffee beans 10 can be monitored as a function of time by the coffee roasting apparatus 100 : ΔH=H−H′=(V*Δt)/2. Any suitable time period between subsequent head space determinations may be applied; for instance, the sensor arrangement 120 may be arranged to perform such periodic measurement at a frequency of once per second or less, e.g. a frequency in a range of 0.1-1.0 Hz, e.g. at a frequency of once per second or more, e.g. a frequency in a range of 1.0-50 or 60 Hz and so on. The transmitter 122 and receiver 124 may cooperate in any suitable manner. For instance, the receiver 124 may be arranged to detect a single signal pulse transmitted by the transmitter 122 or may be arranged to detect a series of signal pulses transmitted by the transmitter 122 , wherein t or At is determined using an average time of flight of the series of pulses. The latter approach has the advantage that statistical outliers may be discarded, e.g. reflections not originating from the surface of the coffee beans 10 , thereby potentially improving the accuracy of the time-of-flight determination. The signal 121 may be any suitable signal, such as an optical signal, an acoustic signal or any other suitable type of electromagnetic signal. An optical signal such as a laser signal or an infrared signal affords more accurate determination of the coffee bean volume but may be relatively expensive to realize, whereas an acoustic signal such as an ultrasound signal can be produced more cheaply but may be less accurate than an optical signal. The signal 121 may have any suitable shape, such as a single pulse or a series of pulses per coffee bean volume determination. In an embodiment, the sensor arrangement 120 is arranged to convert the determined time-of-flight of the signal 121 and its reflection 123 into the volume of the coffee beans 10 for instance as explained above. To this end, the sensor arrangement 120 may include a signal transducer and/or signal processor 126 performing the necessary signal conversions and/or calculations, resulting in the provision of a control signal to the controller 130 that is indicative of this volume or volume change. This control signal may be provided to the controller 130 in any suitable form, e.g. analogue or digital form. Alternatively, the sensor arrangement may be arranged to simply forward the determined time-of-flight of the signal 121 and its reflection 123 to the controller 130 , with the controller 130 being configured to translate the determined time-of-flight into a volume of the coffee beans 10 for instance as previously explained. To this end, the controller 130 may include the previously mentioned signal processor. In yet another embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may include a separate signal processor arranged to receive the time-of-flight data from the sensor arrangement 120 , convert the received time-of-flight data into a volume of the coffee beans 10 for instance as previously explained, and provide the controller 130 with a control signal indicative of this volume. The controller 130 may be adapted to control the heating arrangement in response to the time-of-flight determination by the sensor arrangement 120 . In particular, the controller may be adapted to respond to an increase in the rate of volume change in the coffee beans 10 signalling the occurrence of the first cracking phase. The controller 130 may be responsive to a user interface 150 , which for instance may facilitate a user specifying the desired roasting degree of the coffee beans 10 in any suitable manner, e.g. using a dial, a series of buttons, a programmable display, which may be a touch-screen display and so on. Any suitable type of user interface 150 may be used for this purpose. It will be understood that these embodiments are non-limiting examples of possible arrangements and that many other arrangements are equally suitable; for instance, even though the embodiment of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 as shown in FIG. 1 has been explained using a discrete controller 130 , it is equally feasible that at least some of the discrete components form part of a single arrangement. For instance, the controller 130 may form part of the sensor arrangement 120 and so on. A typical coffee bean roasting profile is schematically depicted in FIG. 3, which schematically depicts the volume V of the coffee beans 10 as a function of the roasting time t. Three phases (labelled I, II and III) can be identified in the roasting process. During phase I, prior to the first cracking of the coffee beans 10 , a modest gradual increase of the coffee bean volume is observed, which is typically less than 10%. During phase II, first cracking of the coffee beans 10 occurs, for instance due to pore forming within the coffee beans 10 , which triggers a more rapid expansion of the coffee bean volume. During phase II, the coffee beans 10 may exhibit an increase in volume ranging from 40%-100% or more. Upon completion of phase II, the coffee beans 10 exhibit a more modest volume expansion during the final roasting phase III, e.g. less than 50%, e.g. in the range of 10-30%, with the rate of expansion being significantly smaller than during the first cracking phase II. These phases are further visualised in FIG. 4, which depicts a series of images of 14 g of Mandheling coffee beans captured at different points in time during the exposure of the beans to a typical thermal roasting process. The sudden increase in volume in the coffee beans during phase II, i.e. during the first cracking phase, is clearly evident. Importantly, the inventors have realized that the point in time where the transition from phase Ito phase II takes place can be unpredictable, i.e. subject to variation, whereas the completion of phase II and subsequent phase III is more predictable, i.e. less subject to variation. Therefore, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be configured to control the roasting process by monitoring the change in the volume of the coffee beans 10 in order to identify the occurrence of the first cracking phase II, thereby identifying the point in time from which the roasting process becomes more predictable. In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be configured to monitor the rate of change of the volume of the coffee beans 10 , with an increase in this rate indicating the start of the first cracking process and a subsequent reduction in this rate indicating the completion of the first cracking process. The rate of volume change may be determined in any suitable manner, e.g. by directly or indirectly determining the difference between subsequent volume determinations. An indirect determination may be the determination of the difference between the times-of-flight of subsequent signals 121 and their reflections 123 , e.g. the difference between two subsequent measurements separated by a set time interval. It should be understood that once the first cracking of the coffee beans 10 has been determined by way of detecting the sudden increase in (the rate of) volume change of the coffee beans 10 as previously explained, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be subsequently controlled by the controller 130 in any suitable manner. For instance, the controller 130 may remain responsive to the sensor arrangement 120 and may terminate the roasting process once the coffee beans 10 have increased in volume by a predetermined amount. In an embodiment, the controller 130 may terminate the roasting process if the volume of the coffee beans 10 , or the increase of this volume, exceeds a defined threshold, e.g. a predefined threshold or a user-defined threshold, in order to prevent the beans becoming too darkly roasted. For instance, the controller 130 may terminate the roasting process if, after completion of the first cracking stage, as for instance indicated by a reduction in the rate of volume expansion of the coffee beans 10 , the volume of the coffee beans 10 has expanded by a predefined or user-defined amount to ensure that the coffee beans 10 have the desired degree of roasting. Alternatively, the controller 130 may terminate roasting process upon the initial volume of the coffee beans 10 having increased by a set amount, i.e. having increased to a target volume that is larger than the initial volume, as the amount of volume increase is indicative of the degree of roasting of the coffee beans 10 . In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be controlled by a combination of the aforementioned volume monitoring and at least one other parameter, such as time, bean color and/or temperature. This for instance may be advantageous to improve the control over the roasting process, in particular if the volume changes in the coffee beans 10 upon completion of the first cracking phase are modest and difficult to detect by monitoring volume change or volume change only. This for instance may be the case if the total volume of coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 is relatively small. In an example embodiment, the controller 130 may be adapted to engage the heating arrangement for a set period of time upon completion of the first cracking process as detected by the aforementioned volume changes in the coffee beans 10 . The set period of time may correspond to a user-defined degree of roasting of the coffee beans 10 , where a longer period of time typically corresponds to a darker roast of the coffee beans 10 . To this end, the controller 130 may include or may have access to a look-up table or the like in which a time period is defined as a function of roasting degree. The controller 130 may further include a timer for controlling the heating arrangement in accordance with the set period of time. As it is well-known per se to control a heating arrangement of coffee roasting apparatus 100 using time as a control parameter, this will not be explained in further detail for the sake of brevity only. It is simply noted that the time control aspect of the aforementioned embodiment may be implemented in any suitable manner. In an example embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be further adapted to control the roasting process by determining the color of the coffee beans 10 , for instance after completion of the first cracking phase of the coffee beans 10 as determined by the change in the volume of the coffee beans 10 as previously explained. To this end, a further sensor 220 may be present in the compartment 110 as schematically shown in FIG. 5, which further sensor 220 is arranged to determine the colour of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . The further sensor 220 is communicatively coupled to the controller 130 such that the controller 130 can further control the heating arrangement of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 in response to the further sensor 220 . As the process of coffee bean colour determination is well-known per se, this will not be explained in any further detail for the sake of brevity only. It is simply noted that any suitable coffee bean colour determination sensing arrangement may be used. FIG. 6 shows an experimental graph showing changes in the volume V of Mandheling coffee beans (dots) and changes in the colour of these coffee beans (squares) as a function of roasting time. The volume scale (in ml) is depicted on the left-hand vertical axis and the colour scale (in Hunterlab colour coordinates) is depicted on the right-hand vertical axis of the graph. The horizontal axis (or x-axis) depicts the roasting time (in minutes). This graph clearly demonstrates that the roasting colour may be used as an auxiliary parameter to determine the progress of the roasting process of the coffee beans 10 . At this point, it is noted that the volume change of the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 may be determined in any suitable manner, and that this determination is not limited to the time-of-flight measurement principle previously explained. An example alternative embodiment is schematically depicted in FIG. 7, in which the sensor arrangement 120 is replaced by a sensor arrangement 310 having a plurality of optical sensors 320 along a side wall of the compartment 110 . Such optical sensors 320 may for instance be arranged to detect a light level at the height of the sensor 320 in the compartment 110 , with the optical sensor 320 being covered by the volume of coffee beans 10 indicating a diminished light level. The controller 130 may be arranged to detect which of the optical sensors 320 report such a diminished light level, which information may be translated into a volume of the coffee beans 10 due to the fact that the optical sensors 320 have a fixed (height) position along the side wall of the compartment 110 . Alternatively, the sensor arrangement 310 may include a signal processor communicatively coupled to the optical sensors 320 to convert the sensor signals of the optical sensors 320 into a signal indicative of the volume of the coffee beans 10 and to forward this indicative signal to the controller 130 . The optical sensors 320 may be arranged to detect ambient light in the compartment 110 . Alternatively, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may further comprise a light source in the compartment 110 for generating light inside compartment 110 that can be detected by the optical sensors 320 . Other suitable volume change detection methods will be apparent to the skilled person, and it is noted that any of these suitable methods may be implemented in the coffee roasting apparatus 100 of the present invention. In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may further comprise a data storage element such as a RAM or Flash memory, look-up table or the like that is communicatively coupled to the controller 130 for storing a roasting profile of the coffee beans 10 . The coffee roasting apparatus 100 , e.g. by means of the controller 130 or by means of a separate signal processor, may be adapted to program a roasting profile as detected by the monitored volume changes of the coffee beans 10 into the data storage element. Such a stored roasting profile may be used during later roasts, e.g. to verify the desired roasting level by comparing the determined relative or absolute volume change against the stored roasting profile, to determine how far advanced the actual roasting process has progressed. In an embodiment, the coffee roasting apparatus 100 may further comprise a data transmission device, e.g. a wireless or wired transmitter, for transmitting roasting data to an external source, e.g. over a wireless link and/or over the Internet or the like. This information for instance may be used to improve the embedded roasting profiles of future coffee roasting apparatuses. The coffee roasting apparatus 100 may be integrated in a coffee brewing apparatus further comprising a coffee bean grinder and a coffee brewing stage. For instance, the coffee brewing apparatus may be arranged to automatically transfer a portion of the roasted coffee beans into the coffee bean grinder for grinding, after which the ground coffee is automatically transported into the coffee brewing stage for brewing a fresh cup of coffee. As such coffee brewing apparatuses are well-known per se, this will not be explained in further detail for reasons of brevity only. It should be understood that the particular embodiment of such a coffee brewing apparatus is not critical to the present invention and that any suitable arrangement of such coffee brewing apparatus may be contemplated. An example embodiment of the coffee brewing method 800 according to the present invention will now be explained in further detail with the aid of FIG. 8, which depicts a flowchart of this example embodiment. The method starts in step 810 for instance with the switching on of the coffee roasting apparatus 100 and/or the filling of the compartment 110 with the coffee beans 10 to be roasted. The method then proceeds to step 820 in which a user defines the desired roasting level of the coffee beans 10 , for instance using the user interface 150 . In step 830 , the sensor arrangement 120 (or any other suitable sensor arrangement, such as the sensor arrangement 310 ) determines the initial parameters of the coffee beans 10 , such as the initial volume occupied by the coffee beans 10 in the compartment 110 . It will be understood that although step 830 is shown as following step 820 , it is equally feasible that step 830 is executed prior to or in parallel with step 820 . The method then proceeds to step 840 in which the targeted volume of the coffee beans 10 corresponding to the desired roasting level as specified by the user in step 820 is determined. This for instance may be achieved by looking up a stored roasting profile and establishing the amount of volume increase required to achieve the desired roasting level. The targeted volume of the coffee beans 10 is typically based on the initial volume of the coffee beans 10 as determined in step 830 . Next, the coffee beans 10 are roasted in step 850 and the volume of the coffee beans 10 is monitored in step 860 during the roasting process of step 850 . It is checked in step 870 if the actual volume of the coffee beans 10 as determined in step 860 corresponds to the target volume determined in step 840 . If it is determined that the actual volume is smaller than the target volume, the method refers back to step 850 and the roasting of the coffee beans is continued. On the other hand, if it is determined that the actual volume of the coffee beans 10 as determined in step 860 corresponds to the target volume, the roasting process is terminated in step 880 after which the method is terminated in step 890 , as the roasting process is complete. It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the processing of coffee, typically the first step is to subject green coffee beans to a roasting process. This process causes thermal decomposition and chemical changes within the beans at which time the familiar aroma and flavour development occurs. A by-product of the roasting process is carbon dioxide gas. Following roasting, coffee almost immediately begins to release carbon dioxide. When in the whole bean state the release of carbon dioxide gas is relatively slow. In some cases it may take in excess of two weeks for all internal carbon dioxide gas built up during the roasting process to be released. In contrast, grinding coffee beans to produce ground roasted coffee results in the release of carbon dioxide and volatile aromatics over a much shortened time frame. As a result of the discharge of carbon dioxide gas, tightly packaged coffee that has not been sufficiently degassed can cause an undesired expansion (and in some cases rupture) of packaging materials. For that reason both roasted coffee beans and ground roasted coffee are commonly transported and stored in bins or open containers following the roasting/grinding process where they are allowed to degas for anywhere from a few hours to upwards of one to two days so that the product that is eventually packaged is essentially carbon dioxide free. Ground roasted coffee also readily absorbs atmospheric moisture and is a good desiccant. In addition, whether it be whole bean or ground, roasted coffee oxidizes when it comes into contact with air, resulting in increased levels of acidity and a general degradation in taste. For these reasons, after being sufficiently degassed coffee is often vacuum packaged in a tightly sealed container to avoid continued contact with air. Alternately, coffee is sometimes packaged in a nitrogen filled container in order to avoid oxidation through contact with air. Unfortunately, the above described methods of processing roasted coffee suffer from a number of substantial draw backs that affect the flavour and aroma of the coffee, and ultimately its price and desirability to consumers. First, degassing coffee increases exposure of the coffee to air and results in enhanced oxidation. Commonly used bulk handling techniques further exasperate the oxidation problem by increasing the contact of the roasted coffee with air. In addition, typical bulk handling equipment that is used in coffee processing (for example conveyor belts, screw conveyors, air conveyors etc.) have a tendency to separate fine and coarse particles and can result in an uneven mixing of fine and coarse particles within individual packaged portions. Ground coffee that is allowed to come into contact with air for any extended length of time runs the risk of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere causing a reduction in the quality of the coffee. It has also been found that a substantial portion of the aromatics associated with roasted coffee are stripped off from either the whole bean or the ground product when the carbon dioxide liberated from the coffee is removed. Appreciating that a significant loss of the aromatics from roasted coffee results in a degradation of the coffee's flavour and taste, others have developed elaborate systems that attempt to capture volatile aromatics, and later condense and process them for use in the production of instant coffee crystals. Finally, a further limitation associated with current coffee processing methods concerns the common practice of vacuum packaging coffee. Where coffee has been packaged within a container under a vacuum environment, immediately upon opening the container the coffee is instantly, and forcefully, aerated causing enhanced and accelerated oxidation. There is therefore a need for an improved method of processing roasted coffee that addresses a number of the limitations present in such methods as are currently in use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention therefore provides a method of processing roasted coffee that provides a means to minimize oxidation, maximize the retention of volatile aromatics, minimize moisture absorption and helps to minimize the separation of fine and course particles in the event that the coffee is subjected to a grinding process. Accordingly, in one of its aspects the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee to improve the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the roasted coffee, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving coffee therein; purging said containers of contained air through flushing said containers with an inert gas; transporting and delivering roasted coffee to a grinding circuit; grinding said roasted coffee directly into a container filling apparatus; with said container filling apparatus, delivering said ground coffee directly into said purged containers; and, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee and to minimize contact of said ground roasted coffee with the air. In a further aspect the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee beans to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the coffee beans following roasting, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving roasted coffee beans therein, purging said containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas and thereafter maintaining said purged containers in a generally upright position with said inert gas retained therein to prevent the influx of air into said purged containers, without delay and without allowing said roasted coffee beans to accumulate in storage bins or staging areas transporting and delivering said roasted coffee beans directly to a container filling apparatus, with said container filling apparatus delivering said roasted coffee beans directly into said purged containers, and, thereafter, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee beans and to minimize contact of said roasted coffee beans with the air. In yet a further aspect the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide gas and aromatics liberated from the coffee, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving roasted coffee therein, purging said containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas and maintaining said purged containers in a generally upright position with said inert gas retained therein, transporting and delivering roasted coffee to a grinding circuit located within an enclosure having an oxygen depleted atmosphere, grinding said coffee directly into a container filling apparatus, with said container filling apparatus delivering said ground coffee directly into said purged containers, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee and to minimize the contact of said roasted coffee with the air, said steps of said method completed with minimal delay between successive steps to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide gas liberated from said coffee prior to the sealing of said coffee within said containers. Further aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken together with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings which show the preferred embodiments of the present invention in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing that graphically depicts the primary stages of one of the embodiments of the preferred method according to the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention may be embodied in a number of different forms. However, the specification and drawings that follow describe and disclose only some of the specific forms of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims that follow herein. According to the method of the present invention, one or more containers are prepared for receiving and packaging coffee therein. Depending upon the end use of the packaged coffee, shipping requirements, retail display considerations and other factors, it will be appreciated that a wide variety of different containers or packages may be utilized. For example, the containers may be of a rigid variety formed from metallic alloys, cellulose products, and/or plastics or other synthetic materials. Similarly, the containers may also be of a flexible or semi-rigid variety, including pre-formed synthetic bags, or bags made from cellulose or other textile materials coated for gas impermeability. In other instances the containers may be constructed from continuous rolls of plastic or other synthetic material that are cut and hermetically sealed to desired sizes in what is often referred to as a form, fill and seal circuit. Regardless of the particular form of container utilized, the preparation of the containers for receiving coffee typically involves the placement of the containers on a conveyor belt or other assembly system such that they can be filled and sealed or form filled and sealed in an efficient and timely fashion. The preparation of the containers for receiving coffee pursuant to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes purging the containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas. Most commonly inert gas would be supplied to the containers through a series of flushing lines directed into the containers while on the assembly line of a processing plant operation. The inert gas used to purge the containers in many cases will have a density either exceeding or relatively close to that of air. Once flushed and purged, the containers proceed through subsequent processing stages in a generally upright orientation to allow the inert gas to remain within the interior of the containers, thereby preventing the influx of air. While a variety of different non-toxic inert gases could be utilized, due to its general availability and relative inexpense, in a preferred embodiment of the invention nitrogen gas is used to purge the containers. The method of the present invention also calls for the transporting and delivering of roasted coffee to a grinding circuit in one embodiment, or for transporting and delivering whole roasted coffee beans directly to a container filling apparatus in an alternate embodiment. Through a thorough understanding of the invention it will be appreciated that the invention is independent of the precise roasting method that is employed, and that a variety of different methods of roasting and roasting equipment could be used. For example, a typical roasting process could involve subjecting green coffee beans to temperatures of between approximately 390 and 460 degrees Fahrenheit causing pyrolysis or thermal decomposition within the beans. At elevated temperatures in this range water is evaporated from the beans followed by pyrolysis causing chemical changes within the bean that result in the familiar aroma and flavour of roasted coffee. During the pyrolysis process carbon dioxide gas is formed and typically builds up within internal cavities in the coffee beans. The specific target temperature to which the coffee beans are elevated and the length of time that they are maintained at that temperature can vary dramatically depending upon the nature and origin of the beans and the desired flavour and colour of the end product. In general, higher roasting temperatures maintained for longer lengths of time result in a somewhat stronger, more robust and darker flavoured coffee. In any event, once the coffee has reached a specific target temperature and has been maintained at that level for the desired length of time the coffee is typically quenched to slow down or retard the pyrolysis reaction. Again the specific method of quenching the roasted coffee may vary broadly, however, typically the hot roasted coffee beans are passed through a cooling chamber where their temperature is reduced through exposure to air, or through quenching with water or or an inert gas such as nitrogen. In accordance with the present invention the coffee exiting the roasting process is preferably quenched and cooled to a temperature of between approximately 80 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Thereafter, in one preferred embodiment the roasted coffee beans are quickly transported and delivered to a grinding circuit to reduce the coffee to granules of a desired size range. The roasted beans are preferably delivered to the grinding circuit without delay to avoid loss of carbon dioxide and to minimize oxidation. As a means to minimize the contact of the beans with air, they may be transported to the grinding circuit in an oxygen depleted environment. Such an environment can be attained through the use of a screw conveyor, by injecting or blowing carbon dioxide or an inert gas onto the beans during transport, or through transporting the coffee within a sealed enclosure where the oxygen has been removed or depleted. When delivered to the grinding circuit the extent to which the coffee is ground will be to a large part dependent upon the coffee's end use. For most residential and commercial uses a granule size of between approximately 0.01 inches and 0.1 inches (Tyler screen size of between #10 and #50 mesh) is sufficient. The particular type of grinding equipment that is utilized has little, if any, bearing upon the invention. Practically any commonly used coffee grinding apparatus could be used. It is expected that in most instances the coffee beans will be ground through the use of a traditional roller mill. Since the grinding of roasted coffee beans accelerates the release of carbon dioxide, in the preferred embodiment of the present inventive method the beans are ground to within their desired size range and deposited immediately and directly into a container filling apparatus that delivers the ground coffee directly into the previously prepared and purged containers. Preferably the grinding circuit is positioned immediately above the filling apparatus such that the ground coffee granules fall directly into the filler apparatus as they exit the grinding and sizing machinery. Essentially, the coffee is “ground” directly into the filling apparatus. Once received within the filling apparatus, the ground roasted coffee is delivered directly to the purged containers by way of a screw conveyor, through a gravity feed mechanism, or through a feeding weigh scale apparatus that deposits coffee into the containers on the basis of weight as opposed to volume. It has been found that in some cases the liberation of carbon dioxide gas from the ground coffee may be significant enough to remove the necessity of purging the containers. In such instances the coffee is ground directly into upright containers that have not been previously flushed with inert gas. Being more dense than air, the carbon dioxide given off by the ground coffee displaces air within the container until the container is essentially oxygen free. With the liberation of carbon dioxide from the coffee generally enhanced at elevated temperatures, the containers may also be heated or cooled as required to stabilize carbon dioxide production and to assist in controlling the amount of oxygen within the container. When coffee is ground not only is the liberation and loss of the carbon dioxide greatly accelerated, so to is the potential for oxidation. For that reason under the present method there is preferably no airveying or conveying of ground coffee through the use of conveyor belts or similar commonly used bulk handling equipment that expose the product to the air. To further reduce oxidation and enhance carbon dioxide retention, an external source of carbon dioxide or inert gas may be supplied to the grinding and/or filling circuits. Blowing carbon dioxide or inert gas into grinding and/or filling circuits tends to reduce oxygen levels within the working environment and minimize the contact of the coffee with oxygen present in the air. Alternately, the grinding and/or filling stages may be carried out within sealed enclosures that either have substantially all of the oxygen within them removed or that operate in a modified oxygen depleted atmosphere. Typically where the grinding and/or filling stages are enclosed, they would be vacuumed or flushed with carbon dioxide or an inert gas (such as nitrogen) to remove or reduce oxygen levels. Thereafter, once grinding and filling commences the natural liberation of carbon dioxide from the coffee will have a tendency of maintaining a zero, or a substantially depleted, oxygen level within the immediate atmosphere surrounding the coffee. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the above described process may be repeated for whole bean coffee processing, with the exclusion of the grinding stage. When processing whole bean coffee, the roasted beans are transported and delivered directly to the container filling apparatus for deposition within the containers in the same fashion as described above with respect to ground roasted coffee. Once again, to minimize oxidation and the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics, the roasted beans are delivered from the roasting circuit to the container filling apparatus without delay, and without allowing the beans to accumulate in storage bins or staging areas as has traditionally been the practice when degassing. In addition, and as in the case of the method of processing ground coffee described above, the beans may be transported from the roasting circuit to the subsequent container filling apparatus in an oxygen depleted environment. This may be accomplished through the use of enclosed screw conveyors, by injecting carbon dioxide or inert gases into the bean transportation circuit, or by transporting the beans from the roasting to the filling stages within a sealed enclosure which the oxygen has been removed or depleted. Whether handling whole roasted coffee beans or ground roasted coffee, following deposition of the coffee within the previously prepared and purged containers the containers are thereafter sealed to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the coffee, and to minimize contact of the coffee with air. Depending upon the particular construction of the container, the method of sealing may vary. For example, where the containers are rigid and formed from metal alloys, cellulose, or synthetic plastics, rigid lids may be applied through methods commonly used in the canning and packaging industries. Where the containers are in the form of flexible synthetic bags, typically their tops would be hermetically sealed or enclosed with the use of adhesives. Under the above described method, the amount of time from the point when coffee beans exit the roasting circuit until they are either directly packaged within containers or ground and then subsequently packaged is kept to a minimum. The roasted coffee is not allowed to sit in storage bins or staging areas to degas. For that reason the coffee will continue to liberate a significant amount of carbon dioxide gas after it has been packaged and sealed within its container. To accommodate this liberation of gas, in the preferred embodiment of the invention the containers are equipped with a pressure-sensitive one-way valve that permits internal gas pressure that exceeds a pre-determined value to be bled off from the interior of the container. The one-way nature of the valve also prevents the influx of air into the container and maintains a high inert gas and/or carbon dioxide environment within the container. The pressure sensitivity of the valve ensures that the valve normally remains in a closed position, in which case the integrity of the seal of the container is maintained. Only when the internal gas pressure exceeds a pre-determined value will the valve begin to slightly open to allow pressure to be bled off. It will be appreciated that the construction of the container and the materials from which it is formed will to a large extent dictate the pressure at which the one-way valve must bleed off built-up internal pressure to maintain the integrity of the container. To prevent air from entering the container the valve should be designed so that it will only open when the internal gas pressure exceeds the outside atmospheric pressure by a specified amount. It will be appreciated from an understanding of the above description that utilization of the method to process and package either roasted coffee beans or ground roasted coffee will result in minimal oxidation of the coffee and minimal loss of liberated carbon dioxide and aromatics. Directly transporting coffee between successive stages in the process with minimal or no delays reduces the overall time from roasting to packaging to within a preferred range of from one to five minutes. Since at no point is the coffee allowed to be retained within storage bins or staging areas to degasify, the opportunity for oxidation and the loss of aromatics is significantly reduced. In addition, when processing ground coffee, grinding the coffee and depositing it immediately and directly into a filler apparatus without the employment of conveyor systems and other commonly used bulk handling machinery further and significantly reduces the time from roasting to packaging and the exposure of the coffee to air. Finally, carrying out the transportation, grinding and/or filling operations within sealed enclosures having an oxygen depleted atmosphere virtually eliminates the opportunity for any significant oxidation of the coffee before packaging and further helps to prevent the loss of liberated carbon dioxide which carries with it valuable and desirable aromatics. As a result, coffee processed and packaged according to the described method tends to be fresher, less acidic, better tasting, and generally has a better aroma. Since the method minimizes the exposure of the roasted coffee to air, the coffee is less susceptible to the deleterious effects of moisture retention that can result through exposure to air, particularly in the case of ground roasted coffee. It is to be understood that what has been described are the preferred embodiments of the invention and that it may be possible to make variations to these embodiments while staying within the broad scope of the invention. Some of these variations have been discussed while others will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.","20020110626"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a method for preparation of a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, using a predetermined amount of coffee grounds. The invention furthermore relates to a corresponding, fully automatic, coffee machine which may be of the piston-type. Fresh coffee-based beverages can be produced in the standard way, for example with a filter coffee machine. In addition, fresh coffee-based beverages can also be prepared with the aid of piston-type machines (so-called specialty machines). Insulated containers with a corresponding warming unit are necessary to keep larger amounts of filtered coffee ready for use. Piston-type machines produce coffee-based beverages with a high share of turbid and suspended materials, which are not desirable for a typical filtered coffee. The reason for this is that piston-type machines push the complete beverage amount with high pressure through a brewing unit, wherein a small amount of hot water, which is clearly lower than the amount guided through the brewing unit, is added later on if necessary, for example via a bypass line. The turbid and suspended materials dissolved out of the coffee grounds during this process then enter the beverage ready for drinking. These turbid and suspended materials, however, are desired for products prepared with a piston-type machine, for example for espresso and Schümli products (wherein beans by Julia Schümli are especially desired for these products). For that reason, these types of machines could not, so far, be used for the preparation of products similar to filtered coffee. German patent document DE 44 09 030 C2 describes a method for the production of a coffee-based beverage, as well as a suitable coffee machine provided with a bypass. The coffee-based beverage is prepared using a predetermined amount of ground coffee and a coordinated amount of hot water, wherein only a portion of the hot water is guided through the coffee grounds for the extraction and then flows into a storage container. The remaining partial amount bypasses the coffee grounds and flows directly into the storage container. The amount flowing through the bypass line is controlled such that at all times a drinkable coffee quality exists inside the storage container. An attempt is made with this method to compensate for fluctuations in the coffee strength during the brewing process. One known option for preparing a cold coffee-based beverage is the preparation of a specialty coffee, preferably an espresso, with the aid of a piston-type machine and subsequently pouring it over ice cubes. This type of preparation is characterized by the combination of ice cubes with a smaller amount of coffee, wherein the special drinking experience above all is based on the existing, non-melted ice. With a different method for preparing a cold coffee-based beverage, for example, regular filtered coffee is produced with a filter coffee machine and is then filled into containers in which it is allowed to cool down to room temperature over a longer period of time. The coffee cooled down in this way is then removed from the containers and, if applicable, is served while filled with ice. These types of beverages, however, are no longer fresh at the time when they are dispensed because of the relatively long cooling down period. The aforementioned method furthermore requires the storage of large amounts of brewed filter coffee since the cooling down period is relatively long, wherein furthermore cooling agents for keeping the beverage cool can require additional energy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for producing a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, and to provide an improved coffee machine for use with this method. According to the intention, a freshly brewed cold coffee-based beverage may be prepared with the aid of a coffee machine, for example, a piston-type coffee machine (specialty coffee machine), by freshly preparing a small amount of warm, extremely concentrated extract of coffee and mixing it proportionally with an excessive amount of cold water, so as to prepare a pleasantly cool, drinkable coffee-based beverage which has a dry substance share and taste that generally obtained with filtered coffee. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provide a method for producing a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage using a predetermined amount of ground coffee, which in one embodiment includes: feeding a predetermined amount of ground coffee into a brewing chamber; preparing a coffee concentrate with the supplied predetermined amount of ground coffee with a brewing operation in the brewing chamber, wherein the prepared coffee concentrate constitutes a specifiable multiple (VK) of a concentration (KN) for a normal drinking quality for filtered coffee at approximately 1.2 to 1.4% dry substance share; and mixing the prepared coffee concentrate with an amount of water which corresponds to a specifiable multiple (VM) of the amount of the prepared fresh coffee concentrate to prepare the fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an automatically controlled coffee machine for preparing a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, which in one embodiment includes: a storage container for ground coffee or whole-bean coffee ground as needed with a grinding device; a pressure-control device to provide a required water pressure; a brewing chamber to prepare fresh coffee concentrate from the ground coffee; a metering device to meter the ground coffee from the storage device or the grinding device into the brewing chamber; a hot water feeding tube connected to the brewing chamber to pre-brew and brew the coffee concentrate; a monitoring unit to determine a concentration for the brewed coffee concentrate; a beverage dispenser connected to the brewing chamber to dispense the brewed coffee concentrate; a cold water feeding tube connected to the dispenser; and a mixing chamber to mix the coffee concentrate with the cold water. The coffee machine may be a piston-type coffee machine. The coffee machine may comprises a beverage outlet connected to the brewing chamber and the cold water feed-in for dispensing fresh coffee-based beverages, preferably in individual portions or multiple portions to be dispensed either directly or to be stored in a container as available supply. By dispensing a freshly prepared cold beverage, the freshness aspect is clearly improved as compared to the traditional method. Furthermore achieved is a considerable reduction in the required storage volume and the number of components needed for cooling down cold coffee-based beverages since the beverages are prepared as need-based. As a result of the mixing with cold water, preferably tap water, an active cooling of the beverage is not required during the preparation of a fresh, cold coffee-based beverage and no waiting or cooling period is necessary. The temperature of the dispensed fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage is approximately the temperature of the available cold water, wherein the dispensing temperature is preferably at most about 15° C., even more preferable at most about 10° C. and especially preferred at most about 5° C. above the cold water temperature. Preparing the extremely small amount of hot coffee concentrate, as compared to the amount of hot coffee prepared during a normal brewing operation, requires a considerably lower amount of energy for cooling a fresh cold coffee-based beverage as compared to the traditional method. In addition, the handling of the process (filling of the supply container, removal of the used coffee grounds) is clearly simplified. For the desired output amount, a predetermined amount of ground coffee is guided into the brewing chamber, for example by freshly grinding coffee beans in a grinder or by using already ground coffee. This so-called coffee cake, however, is not pressed for the brewing operation. The brewing operation starts with a pre-brewing inside the brewing chamber, without pressure, during a specifiable limited time period and at a specifiable temperature. A brewing operation is subsequently carried out with the pre-brewed amount of coffee grounds and at a specifiable pressure, wherein the hot water pressure should amount to less than 2 bar. The brewing operation is stopped before the concentration of the brewed coffee concentrate is below a specifiable multiple of the concentration of a normal drinking quality for filtered coffee, with approximately 1.2 to 1.4% share of dry substance. The specifiable multiple of the concentration amounts to at least five times the concentration used for normal drinking quality. The coffee concentrate prepared in this way is then mixed with cold water until the desired beverage level is reached. Fresh tap water or water cooled to a specified temperature is mixed in for preparing a fresh cold coffee-based beverage. The cold water can furthermore be supplied from a correspondingly cooled storage container, wherein this water can preferably have a temperature of less than about 35° C., especially preferred of less than about 20% C, or even more preferred a temperature in the range of about 10° C. to about 0° C. A fresh cold coffee-based beverage can thus be prepared immediately. Following the complete extraction of the coffee cake, the pressed-out coffee cake is subsequently removed from the brewing chamber and place into a suitable container. According to an embodiment of a coffee machine according to the invention there may be provided a hot-water feeding tube to the brewing chamber and a cold-water feeding tube to the beverage dispenser. These feeding tubes may be provided with control valves and metering devices. The hot-water feeding tube may contain a heating unit and the cold-water feeding tube a cooling device. At least one concentration sensor may be arranged on the brewing chamber to determine the concentration of the coffee concentrate. The concentration of the coffee concentrate may also be determined with the aid of values, obtained ahead of time and stored in the control unit, on the basis of the ratio between the amounts of ground coffee used, the degree of grinding, and the amount of water used. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS These and other features and advantages of the invention will be further understood from the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, to which reference is made for all details not further explained in the description. FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a coffee machine according to the invention. FIG. 2 is a flow chart for an embodiment of a method according to the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The same components or functional units having the same function are given the same reference numbers in the Figures. FIG. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a piston-type coffee machine 1 that may be used to implement the invention. The embodiment of the coffee machine 1 in FIG. 1 includes a storage device 2 for storing the ground coffee which may be provided with a metering device 5 , a brewing chamber 3 with an extraction device, a hot water feeding tube 19 preceded by a heating unit 8 and followed by a hot water valve 11 a , a cold water feeding tube 20 followed by a cold water valve 12 , a beverage outlet 23 , a container 7 and a control unit 10 . The control unit 10 is connected to all sensors and actuators (not shown herein) and controls the coffee machine with the aid of commands input by an input device (not shown herein), or pre-programmed with specifiable parameters and sequences that can be adjusted from the outside. A cold water feeding tube 25 of the hot-water line 19 is provided with a pressure control device 15 . A concentration sensor 17 may be arranged on or in the brewing chamber 3 . Devices 26 , 27 for measuring the amounts can be provided in the hot water feeding tube 19 or in the cold water feeding tube of the hot water line 25 , and in the cold water feeding tube 20 , as well as in the metering device 5 . The brewing chamber 3 , the hot water feeding tube 19 and the cold water feeding tube 20 can furthermore be provided with temperature sensors, not shown herein, which are connected to the control unit 10 . The hot water valve 11 a with intake and the cold water valve 12 with its intake areas are jointly connected to a water supply system 18 . The preparation of a fresh cold coffee-based beverage is described in the following. To prepare a fresh, cold, coffee-based beverage, a desired amount of ground coffee is first moved from the storage device 2 via the metering device 5 , which may be arranged between the storage device 2 and the brewing chamber 3 , into the brewing chamber 3 . A coffee concentrate is then prepared in the brewing chamber 3 through an initial pre-brewing operation with a specifiable amount of hot water supplied by the hot water feeding tube 19 at a specifiable temperature. For this, the hot water valve 11 a or 11 b is opened, for example electromagnetically, by the control unit 10 . Tap water then flows from the tap water system 18 into the heating unit 8 , to be heated up. The heated up water then flows into the brewing chamber 3 . The ground coffee in the brewing chamber 3 is also referred to as coffee cake and is not pressed. The pre-brewing occurs without pressure. A feed-in pressure of the hot water is monitored by the pressure-control device 15 . The control unit 10 controls the feeding of the required amount of hot water via the hot water valve 11 a or 11 b which can be a control valve. This pre-brewing operation takes place during a predetermined time period and is controlled by the control unit 10 . The pre-brewing operation is followed by a brewing operation in the brewing chamber 3 at a pressure of less than 2 bar, for example 1.8 bar. The hot water is guided under this pressure, which can be controlled by the pressure-control device 15 , via the hot water feeding tube 19 through the brewing chamber 3 which contains the ground coffee. As soon as the limit value, stored in the control unit for the amount to be brewed in dependence on the amount of ground coffee used, or until the concentration K of the prepared coffee concentrate determined via a concentration sensor 17 , has reached a specifiable limit value and drops below it, the control unit 10 stops the brewing operation in the brewing chamber 3 by interrupting the feed-in of the hot water. The specifiable limit value amounts to at least five times the limit value defined for the normal drinking quality of filtered coffee. This normal, defined drinking quality of filtered coffee relates to filtered coffee having a dry substance share of approximately 1.2 to 1.4%. Following the brewing operation or parallel to the brewing operation, the prepared coffee concentrate is replenished with fresh, cold water from the cold water feeding tube 20 until the desired beverage level is reached. The cold water temperature is preferably less than about 35° C., especially less than about 20° C. and especially preferred in the range of about 10° C. to about 0° C. This temperature can correspond to the temperature of tap water from the water supply system 18 , which supplies the cold water in this case, wherein additional cooling devices can also be provided. The temperature of the cold water can be monitored with the aid of temperature sensors, which are not shown herein. The coffee concentrate and the cold water are conducted to the beverage dispenser 23 and from there into a container 9 , for example into a cup or a storage container such as a carafe for coffee. The pressed out coffee cake is then discharged from the brewing chamber 3 via an outlet 24 into the container 7 , and the brewing chamber 3 is again ready for a new brewing operation. The brewing chamber 3 may also be in communication with a drain, as illustrated, for cleaning purposes. FIG. 2 contains a flow chart, showing an embodiment of a method according to the invention for preparing a fresh coffee-based beverage with the above-described coffee machine. In a first method step S 1 , a predetermined amount of ground coffee is filled into the brewing chamber 3 . In a second method step S 2 , a coffee concentrate is brewed with the supplied amount of ground coffee in the brewing chamber 3 , wherein the coffee concentrate prepared in this way amounts to multiple times V the concentration KN of the drinking quality for a normal filtered coffee with approximately 1.2 to 1.4% dry substance share. The coffee concentrate in this case is prepared with the aid of several partial steps. First, the predetermined amount of ground coffee is pre-brewed (S 2 - 1 ) without pressure during a specifiable, limited time period, and the brewing operation is then continued by pressing hot water at a specifiable pressure of less than 2 bar, e.g. 1.8 bar, through the coffee grounds inside the brewing chamber (S 2 - 2 ). In an additional partial step (S 2 - 2 - 1 ), a concentration K is determined for the coffee concentrate, either by comparing the amount of coffee grounds used and the volume flow of hot water to the specified values stored in the control unit or by comparing the value analyzed via a concentration sensor to the predetermined value stored in the control unit. The brewing operation is stopped (S 2 - 2 - 2 ) before the concentration K of the brewed coffee concentrate drops below a specifiable multiple VK, at least five times the amount, of the concentration KN for the normal drinking quality of filtered coffee with approximately 1.2 to 1.4% dry substance. A fresh, cold coffee-based beverage is prepared during a third method step S 3 by mixing the coffee concentrate, produced in this way, with an amount of water that corresponds to multiple times VM the amount of the produced fresh coffee concentrate. The invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiments, but can be modified within the framework of the attached claims. For example, it is conceivable that a user of the coffee machine can pre-select the output temperature of the fresh, cold beverage. It will be understood that the above description of the present invention is susceptible to various modifications, changes and adaptations, and the same are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the appended claims.","8635944"

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a grinder for grinding coffee beans, to a method for grinding coffee beans and to a coffee machine, in particular a fully automatic coffee machine. BACKGROUND The appropriate fineness of a coffee powder is a prerequisite for successful coffee preparation. It determines the speed at which the water can flow through the coffee powder and the time period during which aromas and flavors can be released from the coffee powder. This time is called extraction time and it is a quality criterion for the appropriate extraction of the flavors and aromas of the respective coffee beverage. The extraction intensity of a coffee beverage is decisively influenced by the grinding degree of the ground coffee, in addition to contact pressure, water temperature, water quality and bean properties. The grinding degree describes the fineness with which the bean is ground. The grinding process of coffee beans produces a fineness distribution, i.e. not all coffee particles have the same size but are subject to a particle size distribution typical for coffee. The median X50 [μm] of the fineness distribution is a proven measurement for assessing the fineness of the ground coffee. It denotes the value of the particle size that lies in the middle of the quantity distribution (e.g. an idealized ball diameter for measuring instruments with laser diffraction principle). This means that one half of all particles is smaller, and the other half is larger than the median. The finer a grind, the larger the total particle surface area and thus the contact time of the water with the coffee powder. A balanced ratio between aroma and strength is achieved when approximately 18 to 22% of the aromatic substances are dissolved from the coffee. The optimal contact time for espresso preparation is in the range of 25-30 s and for filter coffee several minutes. Under-extraction leads to a too acidic and over-extraction to a too bitter coffee taste. The appropriate grinding degree of espresso powder is at a median of maximum 350 μm, that of café creme at 550 μm and that of filter grinding at 700 μm. The grinding degree of the coffee powder can usually be adjusted in coffee machines with a grinder. High-quality machines even allow infinitely variable adjustment of the grinder and compensate for undesirable boundary conditions (e.g. thermal expansion, grinding disc wear, etc.) by readjusting the grinder components. Some systems use the extraction time of the coffee beverage as an indirect feature to check the appropriate setting of the grinding degree. For the preparation of a high-quality coffee beverage, the appropriate and product-related setting of the grinding degree plays a major role. Two main proven designs of coffee grinders are known which are used in coffee machines. On the one hand, disc grinders and on the other hand cone grinders. Both types of grinders have in common that they consist of two grinding tools, wherein one of these tools is fixed and the other is driven. As a result of the rotational movement of the one grinding tool, the beans are drawn into a grinding gap and are ground ever finer via the tapering grinding gap width. The smallest distance between the two grinding tools is decisive for the produced grinding degree of the coffee powder. To change the grinding degree, the fixed tool can be adjusted relative to the rotating tool so that the distance is varied. These systems are geometry-based methods for changing the grinding degree. According to the technical teachings of EP 2 286 699 B1, it is provided that the grinder for a coffee machine has a first grinding disc that can be driven about an axis of rotation by a drive means and a second grinding disc. The second grinding disc is fixed in a screw-in part which can be screwed into a housing and can be rotated relative to the housing by adjusting means. Thus, a grinding gap between the two grinding discs can be adjusted. The adjusting means are designed coaxially to the screw-in part, which interacts with an adjusting wheel that can be rotated by adjusting means. The grinder also has a feed opening for feeding the coffee beans to be ground and a discharge opening for discharging the coffee ground between the two grinding discs. For adjusting the grinding gap, the grinder has a central adjustment facility which is infinitely variable. An existing problem of these grinder systems is the determination of a zero point at which a minimum degree of fineness can be defined. Only if this is successful, a grinding degree suitable for the product can be set directly and precisely in relation to this zero point. A prerequisite for this is particularly high manufacturing accuracy in the overall design of the grinder (e.g. high axial run-out accuracy in the disc grinder). Furthermore, in conventional coffee grinders, disturbing influences such as thermal expansion of the grinder components, grinding disc wear, bean change, etc. can only be compensated indirectly (e.g. by evaluating the extraction time). Heat influences in particular lead to varying grinding degrees and different swelling behavior of the coffee powder in the brewing unit and are thus the main cause of fluctuating run-down times. As a result of these facts, long adjustment cycles are often required to ideally adjust the grinder of a coffee machine to the desired product and taste profile. Furthermore, the grinding degree can usually only be set and adjusted for a specific product. SUMMARY An object of the invention therefore is to further develop a generic grinder in a functionally advantageous manner. According to an embodiment of the invention, a grinder for grinding coffee beans comprises a first grinding tool and a second grinding tool forming a grinding gap, wherein the second grinding tool is rotatable or is rotated relative to the first grinding tool during operation of the grinder (i.e. during grinding of coffee beans), wherein the grinder has at least one force generation device for applying a force F, which is preferably also adjustable during operation, to the first grinding tool or the second grinding tool, which is transmitted to the coffee beans, wherein the force F is directed in such a way that it presses the respective grinding tool to which the force F is applied in the direction of the respective other grinding tool. The force can be applied during operation, but also when the grinding tools are at a standstill or not in operation. The grinder according to the invention serves or is designed for grinding coffee beans. It can be used as a stand-alone unit or integrated into a coffee machine, e.g. a fully automatic coffee machine. The grinder comprises a first grinding tool and a second grinding tool. The grinding tools form a grinding gap or define such a grinding gap from opposite sides. This grinding gap can be designed flat or increasingly towards the center, and preferably defines a plane, more preferably a plane of symmetry. The second grinding tool can be rotated relative to the first grinding tool, in particular rotatably driven by a drive unit such as a motor. The grinder also has at least one force generation device for applying a force F to the first grinding tool or second grinding tool, which is transmitted to the coffee beans to be ground. Thus, in addition to the weight of the grinding tools, a further force is added to the weight of the grinding tools, which can be adjusted during operation of the grinder and which is applied by the force generation device. In this process, the force F is directed in such a way that it presses the respective grinding tool to which the force F is applied, in particular axially in the direction of the respective other grinding tool. The force generation device thus presses the two grinding tools together and not, as is known from the prior art, away from each other. The application of force virtually replaces the support of the grinding tool on an abutment. With an adjustable force, a product-specific optimum grinding degree can be achieved that remains largely constant even under changed process conditions. It may be advantageously provided that a product-specific grinding degree is set by applying a force with an adjustable process force. In this respect, it can also be provided that when changing the type of coffee or the product type (e.g. from espresso to café crème), a product-specific setting of the grinding degree or changeover is automatically performed when the product is received from a fully automatic coffee machine in which the grinder is integrated. This setting of the grinding degree can be carried out extremely quickly with the invention, for example to change from a setting of the grinding degree for espresso to a setting of the grinding degree for café crème. Since the adjustment or changeover is very fast, a second grinder may even be unnecessary in a fully automatic coffee machine. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preparing coffee with a coffee machine, in particular with a fully automatic coffee machine, and with a grinder of the above type, in which coffee beans are ground with the grinder and in which coffee of a specific type is prepared in a brewing unit from the coffee beans and water. In one embodiment, the grinding degree is automatically adjusted or changed, depending on the type of coffee (for example espresso or café crème), before grinding, in the case of a change in the type of coffee, and further depending on the amount of water and the amount of ground coffee and optionally depending on additives such as milk. During operation of the grinder, one of the two grinding tools can be at a standstill and the second of the two grinding tools can be rotatably operated by a drive unit, e.g. a motor. However, both grinding tools can also rotate, in particular in opposite directions to each other. The force generation device can act upon both the first and second grinding tool, so that a more even distribution of force is achieved. However, in terms of design it is easier if the force generation device only acts upon one grinding tool, in particular the one at a standstill of the two grinding tools. Furthermore, a force generation device can also act upon the first grinding tool and upon the second grinding tool. In this case, according to one embodiment, it may be provided that the force generation device has at least one spring and a device for setting a pretensioning force of the spring, in particular in the form of a servomotor. This embodiment is particularly easy to implement in terms of design and is easily controllable and/or adjustable. It should generally be noted that it is not primarily important which of the grinding tools (also referred to as “cutting tools” in the following), driven or stationary grinding tool, has a degree of freedom in the direction of the process force and is actively subjected to a force in this direction. The force adjustment can be automatic (e.g. motorized) or manual (e.g. adjusting wheel). With motorized adjustment, a control loop is conceivable, wherein the grinding degree is changed if the last extraction times deviate from the target run-down time. The constructive implementation of a force control can be realized in different ways. One possibility is the compression of a mechanical spring by a certain distance x with known force-displacement characteristic curve. However, there are also other solutions for applying a defined force to one of the cutting tools. First of all, a pneumatic approach is conceivable here, wherein one grinding disc carrier can be actively pressed against the other with variable air pressure. A passive embodiment would be a gas pressure spring with a fixed force-displacement characteristic curve, wherein only a certain grinding degree would then be adjustable in the grinder. However, springs are also available with variable gas pressure. Alternatively, however, it may also be provided that the force generation direction is based on a fluid operating principle. Since the distance between the grinding tools or cutting tools in the disc grinder only has to change slightly up to 0.2 mm depending on the process force during grinding, hydraulic solutions with fluids of higher compression modules are also possible to control the force. Even then, the system would have a damping effect during grinding. A rubber diaphragm can be used to apply force, which is filled with water via an adjustable pressure reducer. A hydraulic water system is available in coffee machines anyway and could be used to regulate the grinding degree. Furthermore, the force generation device can also be advantageously based on an electromagnetic operating principle. In this solution, the movable cutting tool carrier is pressed against the fixed one due to a variable magnetic force. Since the magnetic force changes with increasing distance between armature and yoke, a balance of forces can also be achieved in an electromagnetic system during the grinding process between the cutting tools. The grinder can also be designed in different ways, therefore advantageously as a disc or cone grinder. The force generation device can have at least one pressure spring corresponding to the above designs, wherein the grinding gap extends over a plane E and wherein the pressure spring exerts an axial force perpendicularly to the plane E on the first and/or second grinding tool. Several springs, especially pressure springs, can be provided. These can be arranged symmetrically around the axis of rotation, which is formed by the rotating grinding tool, to achieve an optimally distributed application of force. A coil spring may be used as a pressure spring for the present application. However, springs or spring assemblies of other types can also be used. The force generation device may have a device for setting a pretensioning force of the spring, in particular of the pressure spring, in particular in the form of a servomotor. This servomotor is preferably an actuator which is controlled and/or regulated by a control and/or evaluation unit. The setting of the servomotor can be adjusted depending on a) the coffee beans, in particular the type of beans and their degree of roasting; b) the temperature of the grinder; and/or c) a degree of wear of the grinder. For example, the type of coffee beans can be predetermined by manual adjustment or determined by the power of the motor driving the grinder or the grinding tools. In this case, the determined power is compared with a data record stored on the control and/or evaluation unit within the scope of an actual value/target value comparison with regard to the power depending on the force to be applied to achieve a certain grinding degree or with regard to a bean type depending on the force to be applied to achieve a certain grinding degree. According to a further embodiment, it may be provided that when using a spring, the corresponding force-displacement characteristic curve is also specified as a data record, so that a specific adaptation of the spring force can be carried out by an actuator depending on the determined force to be applied. In the same way, the temperature of the grinder or the degree of wear (number of grinding processes) can be determined and the force to be applied can be adjusted accordingly by a target value/actual value comparison. It is also possible to combine the different sizes within the scope of a weighting, e.g. number of grinding processes with weighting according to bean type, in order to depict a more precise wear behavior. The grinder can optionally be equipped with a temperature sensor to determine the thermal expansion of the grinder and to control the force generation device to adjust the grinding degree. A method according to the invention for grinding coffee beans for the preparation of a caffeine-containing hot beverage, in particular by means of a grinder according to the invention, may comprise at least the following steps: a) Picking up of coffee beans in a grinding gap between two grinding tools; b) Applying an adjustable process force to at least one of the two grinding tools in the direction of the respective other grinding tool by a force generation device: and c) Output of the ground coffee or the ground product with a defined grinding degree. It is advantageous to adjust the magnitude of the process force depending on the type of coffee beans, the power of the grinder motor, the temperature of the grinder and/or the previous grinding passes. When adjusting the magnitude of the process force, a desired degree of fineness of the ground product can also be considered. Corresponding data records according to degree of fineness or grinding degree can be stored on the control and/or evaluation unit. During the grinding process, the cutting of the beans generates a force with which the cutting tools (grinding discs) are pressed apart. The stronger the force applied by the process force or counteracting force generation device, the finer the grinding degree. If there are no more beans, the disc-like grinding tools are clamped against each other with the contact pressure. Since the grinding tools are usually designed in such a way that they cannot get caught in each other, the grinder cannot fail. However, in the event of an empty bean container, grinding noise and damage to the flat surface of the grinding discs could occur. In addition, undesirable heat effects can occur, which can have a negative effect on the quality of the coffee grinding. With cone grinders, the cutting tools could even block. To solve this problem, it may be advantageously provided for the grinder to have a stop, in particular an adjustable stop, to set a minimum grinding degree. In this respect, it can be provided in particular that the axially movable tool part or the corresponding grinding tool is pressed against a stop. This end stop is adjustable before the grinder is put into operation and at the same time defines the minimum grinding degree to be produced. When force is applied, ideally there should only be a minimum gap between the cutting tools. If a greater contact pressure is subsequently specified than the process force during the grinding process, a ground product is produced with the fineness of this grinding disc gap. In practice, the touching point (beginning of audible grinding noises) of grinding disc grinders is an indicator of the zero point of the grinder. However, this is highly dependent on the axial run-out of the grinding discs and the individual hearing sensation of the grinder fitter. A suitable objective adjustment of the zero point can be carried out e.g. by an optional device to detect a certain electrical continuity of the lower and upper disc (electrical conductivity measurement). In conventional batches of grinders, grinding beans with respect to this reference point would still cause differences in the fineness distribution because the accuracy of the gap is directly related to the axial run-out tolerances of the discs. However, the use of this zero point definition for a force-controlled setting of the grinding degree has considerable advantages, because the subsequent fineness adjustment is only force-dependent and the stop is only used to prevent the touching point from being exceeded. Furthermore, such a construction leads to the avoidance of too finely adjusted grinders and overloading of the drive. A grinding degree that is too fine can lead to undesired long extraction times, in particular when producing filter coffee. Finally, this can also compensate for manufacturing tolerances in the design of the grinder. In terms of design, an end stop can be realized by means of a threaded adapter of one of the grinding disc carriers. Eventually, the carrier can be rotated up to the touching point of the cutting tools and then be fixed in this position. Thus, a minimum fineness level can be designed to be adjustable so that the cutting tools cannot grind on each other. The method according to the invention can also be further optimized by appropriate options. Therefore, it may be provided that a blockage of the cutting tools caused by impurities in the beans (pieces of wood, stones) can be released by removing the application of force. This is a simple and effective solution to the problem of cutting tool blockage. The grinder can be designed as a disc or roller or cone grinder according to advantageous embodiments. In one embodiment of the method it is provided that the adjustment of the magnitude of the process force is controlled by a control loop, wherein the control loop comprises the control and/or evaluation unit and at least one force measuring device having at least one force sensor. This has the advantage of enabling direct regulation of the grinder with regard to particle fineness. For this purpose, the grinder has in a further embodiment at least one force measuring device having at least one force sensor, wherein the at least one force sensor is directly or indirectly connected to the grinding tool. Such a force sensor can be a low-cost, high-quality component available on the market. For this purpose, different embodiments such as hydraulic pressure sensors, load cells, etc. are suitable. Another embodiment is designed in such a way that the at least one force sensor is connected to the control and/or evaluation unit and forms a measuring device of a control loop, which has the control and/or evaluation unit. The control and/or evaluation unit can have a computer, the programming of which can be extended by one or more control programs.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the following, the invention is described in more detail with reference to the drawings by means of an exemplary embodiment. The figures only serve to explain the invention in more detail and are not restrictive for the invention. Individual features described can also be transferred to further embodiment variants within the scope of general technical knowledge, wherein: FIG. 1 : is a schematic front view in section of an embodiment of a grinder according to the invention for grinding coffee beans: FIG. 2 : is a diagram showing the results of a series of grinding tests: FIG. 3 : is another diagram showing the results of a series of grinding tests: FIG. 4 : is a schematic front view in section of an embodiment of a grinder according to the invention for grinding coffee beans; and FIG. 5 : is the front view of the grinder according to FIG. 1 with a force sensor device. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a schematic front view in section of the device according to the invention, in the form of a grinder 1 for grinding coffee beans 5 . Grinder 1 has a first grinding tool 2 . The first grinding tool 2 is non-rotatably mounted in a housing not shown here. In this respect, the first grinding tool 2 is at a standstill during operation of grinder 1 . The first grinding tool 2 is designed here as a grinding disc and therefore has a cylindrical envelope geometry and a central opening 3 . The grinding tool 2 can also be designed differently, e.g. as a grinding cone. The opening 3 can be penetrated by a feed hopper 4 . Coffee beans 5 to be ground are fed to the device 1 through the feed hopper 4 and the opening 3 . The grinder 1 can also be provided for grinding other semi-luxury foods or foodstuffs but is preferably intended for grinding coffee beans 5 . The feed hopper 4 is advantageously designed to prevent undesirable bridge formation of the coffee beans 5 in the feed hopper 4 . The first grinding tool 2 has a conical recess 6 on its side facing away from the feed hopper 4 . The recess 6 has at least one grinding edge 7 . The grinder 1 has a second grinding tool 8 . The second grinding tool 8 is arranged coaxially to the first grinding tool 2 and below the first grinding tool 2 . The term “below” refers to the drawing plane of FIG. 1 . The second grinding tool 8 is rotatably mounted in a housing not shown here. In this respect, the second grinding tool 8 rotates during operation of grinding tool 1 . The second grinding tool 8 also has a cylindrical envelope geometry. The second grinding tool 8 can also be designed differently, e.g. as a grinding cone. The second grinding tool is rotatable relative to the first grinding tool. In this case, the second grinding tool 8 is non-rotatably connected to a drive shaft 9 of a motor 10 so that the second grinding tool 8 is set in rotation while the first grinding tool 2 stands still. This is advantageous, but not mandatory. Alternatively, the first grinding tool can be rotatable or rotated during operation while the second grinding tool 8 stands still. It is also possible that both grinding tools can be rotated, e.g. in opposite directions of rotation and/or at different speeds, so that there is always a relative movement between the two grinding tools 2 , 8 . Alternatively, a shaftless direct drive is also possible, in which one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is the rotor of the motor 10 , or an indirect drive, in which the motor 10 acts upon one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 via a transmission. The second grinding tool 8 has a conical recess 11 on its side facing away from the motor 10 . The recess 11 has at least one grinding edge 12 . The conical recess 6 of the first grinding tool 2 and the conical recess 11 of the second grinding tool 8 thus form a kind of double conical grinding chamber 13 , which opens at its outer circumference into a grinding gap 14 . A collecting device (not shown here) can be connected to the grinding gap 14 , which collects the coffee beans, preferably coffee powder, emerging from the grinding gap 14 and feeds the powder into an extraction process. The grinder 1 has at least one force generation device 15 . In this case, the force generation device 15 acts upon the first grinding tool 2 , which means that a respective force F acts continuously, i.e. during operation while one or both grinding tools are rotating, upon coffee beans located between the first grinding tool 2 and the second grinding tool 8 . This is advantageous, but not mandatory. The force generation device 15 can also act upon the second rotatable grinding tool 8 or upon both grinding tools 2 , 8 . Here, the force generation device 15 comprises two pressure springs 16 , which can be pretensioned by a corresponding device 17 , for example by a servomotor, by a variable pretension path X, so that the respective force F, which acts upon the first grinding disc 2 and thus, during operation upon the coffee beans, can be changed or adjusted in its amount. The force generation device 15 can also be designed differently than shown in FIG. 1 . In this case, the force effect is essential, wherein the amount of force F is preferably variable or adjustable. In this case, the force generation device 15 can also be designed in such a way that the amount of force F is controlled automatically and/or infinitely variable depending on the higher-level operating parameters of a coffee machine. This makes it advantageously possible to carry out a defined presetting of a grinding degree C., since the force F correlates with the grinding degree C., i.e. the size distribution of the ground product particles, characterized by the particle size of the 50% median of the ground coffee, which will be explained below. In addition, the force acting upon the coffee beans by the grinder 1 can be set advantageously by the force generation device, depending on the coffee beans 5 to be ground and the desired grinding degree C. Preferably, data records regarding the grinding degree C. and the bean type and the force to be generated by the force generation device are stored on a data memory of a control and/or evaluation unit 18 for controlling a coffee machine and in particular the grinder 1 . The aforementioned control and/or evaluation unit 18 can be assigned to the grinder 1 or be part of a coffee machine, e.g. a fully automatic coffee machine. A setting of the grinding degree C. can thus be adjusted to match the specific bean (e.g. hard/heavily roasted beans vs. less heavily roasted café crème beans). See also FIG. 3 in this respect. Alternatively, the type of beans can also be determined by the difference in power of the grinding efficiency by means of which the motor 10 is operated. Furthermore, the force-controlled adjustment of the grinding degree C. allows a permanent reproducibility of the grinding degree C. even in case of grinding tool wear. For this purpose, a characteristic curve for wear over time can be stored for each bean type. The number of grinding processes can be weighted differently depending on the bean type used. Thus, for example, after 100 grinding processes of a “hard” bean type, a readjustment can be made by means of the device 17 . Likewise, the force-controlled setting of the grinding degree C. can be used advantageously to compensate for thermal expansion effects, in particular of the grinding tools 2 and 8 . For this purpose, a temperature sensor 23 (see FIG. 5 ) can detect the heat of the coffee beans as they leave the grinder 1 , represented by the double arrow—dashed line between the arrow at the output of the grinder and the temperature sensor 23 , which has an output leading to the control and/or evaluation unit 18 which, taking into account the coefficients of thermal expansion of the material of the grinding tools, accordingly adjusts the force of the force generation device 15 , in particular the pretensioning force of the pressure springs 16 . Furthermore, manufacturing inaccuracies of the grinding tools 2 , 8 , such as axial run-out tolerances of the grinding tools 2 , 8 have a significantly lower disturbing influence on the “grinding degree zero setting” of grinder 1 than in other grinding devices. Consequently, there are advantageously lower fluctuations of a grinding efficiency O of the grinder 1 and the generated grinding degree C. during operation of the grinder 1 . The grinder 1 described here opens up the possibility of changing the grinding degree C. of coffee beans, including espresso beans, in a force-controlled manner via the force generation device 15 . The inventive idea is based on a relationship between the force F acting upon the grinding tools 2 , 8 and the resulting distribution of the particle size of the coffee beans. The narrower the grinding gap 14 is, the finer is the ground product produced and the greater the reaction force with negative sign −F with which the grinding tools 2 , 8 are pressed apart. In embodiments according to the prior art, this force is absorbed by the grinding housing via the upper grinding tool. The relationship between a fixed geometry of the grinding tools 2 , 8 and the resulting relationship between the amount of force and the grinding degree C. can be determined empirically (see FIG. 2 ). The knowledge gained from this can be used to permanently and precisely adjust the grinding degree C. of the device 1 . If the magnitudes of the forces are known, they can be specified in certain gradations in order to produce a specific grinding degree C. (see also FIG. 3 ). FIG. 3 shows the results of a grinding test series. In this case, the upper grinding disc 2 was subjected to different forces F and then three grinds were performed with the Bacio Nero bean. The coffee powder was then measured with a particle measuring device (measurement based on laser diffraction). The different grinding samples correspond to the three characteristic curves fineness measurement 1 - 3 , wherein the median of the fineness distribution (grinding degree C.) is used as characteristic in each case. At the same time the grinding efficiency O of the device 1 was noted, i.e. the output grinding quantity of the device 1 per second. The device 1 was controlled by the motor 10 with power supply 230V, 50 Hz for 5 s each. FIG. 3 considers the influence of the amount of force F on the grinding degree C. and the grinding efficiency O when grinding different beans. The bean types Bacio Nero, La Tazza Verde (Melitta) and a reference type were ground. In this case again, grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C. were recorded at different amounts of force F acting upon the grinding tools 2 , 8 . Experiments have therefore shown that there is a good correlation between grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C. of a bean, provided that the production accuracy of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is within a certain tolerance (see FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 ). From the grinding efficiency O of different grinders, it is therefore possible to draw conclusions about the produced grinding degree C. with a high degree of accuracy, provided that the behavior of the grinding tools 2 , 8 is known. Under these conditions, a bean-specific force F can be inferred, with which a desired particle size distribution or a desired grinding degree C. can be achieved. With the help of a database, in which the behavior of a reference roast and reference bean is stored, a control of the force F can then be performed in order to set the desired particle size distribution or the desired grinding degree C. for the current roast and bean. As soon as the grinding efficiency O changes to a corresponding force F, because another bean or roast is used or the batch of a roast or bean type can be ground differently, the system regulates independently by a factor that depends on the grinding degree. This means that the force F is adjusted in order to obtain a desired particle size distribution or a desired grinding degree C. Furthermore, for presetting a fully automatic coffee machine, a grinder-specific determination of the relationship between grinding efficiency O and grinding degree C. is conceivable. In this way, increased accuracy can be generated for a specific grinder and the roast or bean type to be ground in it, in order to set a required grinding degree C. at a specified amount of force F. The grinding efficiency O of device 1 can be determined by means of already known methods: An indirect possibility is to use a cake height of the coffee powder in the extraction process at a given contact pressure to infer the weight of the coffee powder provided for the extraction process. A piston coffee machine offers this possibility due to the already existing brewing unit. Since the control time of the grinder is specified, the grinding efficiency O can then be inferred. A direct possibility is to weigh out the coffee powder. This can be automated by grinding in a set drawer and controlling it with a load cell. Another possible application of a force-controlled setting of the grinding degree C. is the combination of the device 1 with a regulation of the contact time between brewing water and coffee powder. To produce a constant beverage quality with a constant proportion of dissolved flavorings, a constant quantity of coffee powder with identical grinding degree C. must be passed through by a specified amount of water within a certain time. Other basic conditions such as water temperature, contact pressure and brewing pressure must also remain as constant as possible during the brewing process so that the swelling behavior of the coffee is comparable and the contact time between the brewing water and the coffee powder remains identical. A further embodiment of the grinder 1 is shown in FIG. 4 which, in comparison to FIG. 1 , shows a rolling element 19 arranged between the grinding tool 2 and the pressure springs 16 . It can also be a rolling bearing, e.g. a ball bearing or a needle bearing with a rolling element cage, wherein the pressure spring rests on the rolling element cage. This can extend coaxially to the feed hopper 4 . The rolling element bearing allows rotation of the grinding tool 2 without the connection point of the respective pressure spring rotating with it. This means that force can also be applied to a rotating tool element and, for example, force can also be applied to both tool elements. FIG. 5 shows the front view of the grinder according to the invention and FIG. 1 with the addition of one or more force sensor devices 20 arranged in cooperation with one of the grinding tools 2 , 8 . In this case, two sensor devices 20 are shown. A first force sensor 21 is in interaction with the grinding tool 8 at a standstill, whereas a second force sensor 22 is in interaction with the first grinding tool 2 . Each force sensor 21 , 22 can be directly or indirectly connected to the corresponding grinding tool 2 , 8 . The force sensors 21 , 22 can, for example, be a pressure sensor (e.g. a load cell or a hydraulic pressure sensor), which respectively records the force during a grinding process by direct or indirect measurement. Each force measuring device 20 is connected to the control and/or evaluation unit 18 , as shown by the arrows in FIG. 5 , and forms a measuring device of a control loop. The control and/or evaluation unit 18 has at least one target value/actual value comparator and a manipulated variable generator, which is coupled to an electrical fineness adjustment of the grinder 1 , which is not shown, but can easily be imagined. Since the axial force/fineness ratio of different beans in a grinder can be determined empirically, the grinder 1 is able to electrically set/adjust desired grinding degrees and to regulate them against disturbing factors (temperature, bean change, grinding disc exchange) with this control loop. This results in the following advantages: 1. compensation of thermal expansion effects; 2. quick initial adjustment of a grinder (in particular when changing the grinding tool); 3. fineness adjustment during bean change; and 4. direct regulation of the grinder 1 with regard to particle fineness (see indirect regulation via extraction time of the coffee cake).","12082743"

The person skilled in the art knows fully automatic coffee machines, which produce various coffee variants according to the espresso method, i.e. under pressure. Furthermore, there have long been conventional machines for the production of filter coffee. Due to the comparatively slow and low-pressure brewing process, a coffee with a very balanced taste and aroma is achieved. In conventional espresso production, the aroma is released quickly. The brewing process, which is usually less than 30 seconds for a cup of coffee in a fully automatic coffee machine, releases more essential oils and aromas due to the pressure of about 7.5-9 bar, but less caffeine, tannins and bitter substances due to the short brewing time. There are enthusiasts for both types of coffee. DE 42 40 175 C1 discloses a brewing unit with an automatically operating coffee machine. The choice of coffee production is made by the brewing position of the brewing plunger. Café Crème is made by coffee pressing, whereas filter coffee is made without coffee pressing. A similar setting between cream coffee and filter coffee is made in DE 33 16 157 A1. EP 0 909 542 A1 discloses a coffee machine for selectively brewing a filter coffee and an espresso coffee. U.S. Pat. No. 6,513,419 B2 and WO 2007/060 694 A1 each disclose a coffee machine for preparing various types of coffee, including filter coffee. These aforementioned documents do not disclose any division of the brewing process of the filter coffee into several brewing phases. A balanced extraction of the respective flavors can therefore not be achieved. DE 20 2016 008 296 U1 is cited as further prior art, but this does not relate to the production of filter coffee. DE 10 2018 116 306 A1 discloses various characteristics of a filter coffee as distinguished from other types of coffee, such as espresso. A preparation of filter coffee with several brewing phases is not disclosed, rather in this case admixing of coffee powder takes place parallel to the brewing process, wherein the amount of water/volume flow can be constant or preferably variable and preferably also monitored once or continuously. The invention is therefore based on the object of operating a fully automatic coffee machine in such a way that a coffee with a taste comparable to filter coffee is provided. The invention solves the problem by an operating method having the features of claim 1 and by providing a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention. A method according to the invention for producing a coffee beverage with a filter coffee flavor is carried out by a fully automatic coffee machine. The fully automatic coffee machine comprises at least one brewing unit having a brewing chamber and a plunger which is movable, in particular linearly displaceable, in the brewing chamber for adjusting a volume of this brewing chamber of the brewing unit. Such fully automatic coffee machines are known per se, but are not usually used for making filter coffee, but for making espresso or espresso-based beverages. The plunger is moved mechanically by an actuator, e.g. motorized or hydraulic, which adjusts the brewing chamber volume. The method according to the invention is characterized by the following steps of: a. filling the brewing chamber with ground coffee; and b. feeding water into the brewing chamber for the purpose of extraction in the course of a brewing process. In this case, at least the plunger is arranged during at least one brewing phase of the brewing process in a position in which the brewing chamber volume is greater than the volume of the ground coffee in a loosely filled state in the brewing chamber after the filling according to step a has taken place. This loosely filled state refers to the poured volume that occurs when an amount of ground coffee corresponding to the amount of ground coffee in the brewing chamber from step a is present in an uncompacted state. In the first position of the plunger, the volume of the brewing chamber is expanded in such a way that a suspension of ground coffee and water can be present, in which the ground coffee can be deposited at the bottom of the brewing chamber and/or floating in the suspension. The ground coffee may be present in a substantially uncompacted manner in the loosely filled state at the start of step b. This essentially means that a small amount of compaction of the ground coffee for the purpose of bringing it into form is possible. Typically, a loosely filled state has a conical shape. However, the bringing into form into a cylindrical shape can be carried out without mechanically compressing the volume of ground coffee to a greater extent. In contrast, a non-mechanical compression and/or compaction of a coffee ground fill, i.e., a compression or compaction without a mechanical force acting from the outside, is inherent to the brewing process due to the swelling of the ground coffee. The ground coffee can be compacted somewhat after filling and in particular before the brewing process. In a preferred embodiment, however, the ground coffee is essentially uncompacted. This means that the ground coffee is compacted by less than 15% by volume, in particular less than 10% by volume, compared to a loosely filled state, i.e. as a loose pile. This infinitesimal compression can take place in the course of shaping the ground coffee, for example to give the ground coffee a basic cylindrical shape in which extraction takes place more uniformly than in the case of a conical shape typical of loosely filling. The water can then flow through the ground coffee during the at least one brewing phase without a mechanical pressing force being exerted on the ground coffee that further compresses it compared to the loosely filled state. Due to the swelling of the ground coffee, however, compaction can still occur without an external mechanical contact force being exerted on the ground coffee for this purpose. In particular, water supplied in step b can flow through the ground coffee essentially without the application of a pressing force. The plunger can thus be moved or set to a second position in which it shapes the ground coffee, preferably before the brewing process. This makes it possible to achieve uniform distribution within the brewing chamber as a function of the amount of ground coffee. Furthermore, and also optionally, the plunger can be maximally retracted in the first position, whereby the volume of the brewing chamber is maximally expanded. Individual brewing phases can be carried out in this maximally extended position. There may also be an air space between the suspension and the front surface of the plunger. However, the said first position does not necessarily have to represent the maximum extended state either, but can also be lower. In addition to the main brewing phase, further brewing phases can also be provided. Preparatory or post-processing steps such as coffee grinding or subsequent cleaning, e.g. by CIP (clean in place), can also be part of the method according to the invention. In this case, parts do not have to be dismantled during CIP cleaning and cleaning can be carried out within the fully automatic machine by automatic processes. The method makes it possible to implement filter coffee production in a fully automatic coffee machine in an uncomplicated manner. The free water volume enables, among other things, sponging of the ground coffee. In addition, the ground coffee can be flowed around more easily in an uncompacted state. For a balanced extraction of the respective flavors, it is advantageous if the brewing process comprises several brewing phases in which water is passed through the ground coffee at different flow rates in relation to the brewing phases. According to the invention, the change between the brewing phases is preferably performed by measuring instruments detecting and/or determining a physical variable, in particular the conductivity, the refractive index and/or the quantity of ground coffee and/or water supplied and/or the quantity or volume of coffee removed or discharged. This allows the maximum amount of flavor substances to be extracted. In this context, coffee is a natural product whose flavor substances can vary depending on the area of cultivation, roasting process, storage, etc. The preferred variant is a water-volume-controlled change as a function of the output quantity, taking into account the amount of ground coffee. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are the subject matter of the subclaims. As previously described, the plunger can remain in a first position during the brewing process, which is also described below as the rest position. Preferably, the brewing chamber volume at the beginning of step b can be at least 50% larger, preferably twice as large, as the volume of the ground coffee in the loosely filled, in particular uncompacted, state. Furthermore, preferably and advantageously, the brewing chamber is constructed in such a way that at the beginning of step b only the ground coffee is arranged inside the brewing chamber. In fact, the free volume of the brewing chamber, which is filled with hot water in step b, adjoins the ground coffee. It is particularly advantageous in this context if the brewing process is a) a first brewing phase with a second flow rate and b) has a second brewing phase with a first flow rate and/or preferably a third brewing phase with a third flow rate, wherein the second flow rate may be less than the first flow rate and/or the third flow rate. Advantageously, the brewing process is divided into at least 2, preferably 3, brewing phases, each of which can be assigned one of at least 2, preferably 3, different flow rates. For example, the aforementioned second brewing phase can be designed as the main brewing phase. Furthermore, the first brewing phase can be designed as the pre-brewing phase and the third brewing phase as the post-brewing phase. However, this division or temporal sequence is not mandatory. Thus, the said second brewing phase can also be the first or the last brewing phase of the brewing process at the same time. These process phases advantageously run one after the other, and particularly preferably immediately one after the other. In this context, the second flow rate is preferably smaller than the third flow rate, which in turn is preferably smaller than the first flow rate. The flow rate for at least one brewing phase of the brewing process may be comparatively slow and less than or equal to 10 ml/s, preferably 2-5 ml/s. Preferably, the flow rate for at least the second brewing phase of the brewing process can be 2-5 ml/s. Also preferably, the flow rate for at least the first brewing phase of the brewing process may be 5-10 ml/s. In addition, the flow rate for at least the third brewing phase of the brewing process may be 10-15 ml/s. The fully automatic coffee machine may further comprise a coffee grinder, wherein the method comprises grinding coffee beans to a predefined size for filter coffee. As is known, the grinding degree for filter coffee is coarser than the grinding degree for espresso coffee. Therefore, it is advantageous if the operating parameters of the coffee grinder are automatically set to an optimum grinding degree for filter coffee by the automatic coffee machine when the beverage request or selection “filter coffee” is made by the user. The grinding degree can be determined according to DIN 44 539. DIN 44 539 defines three gradations for classifying the grinding degree. Grain sizes are defined which must account for a proportion of more than 50% of the ground material, in this case ground coffee. The value x 50,3 indicates in the measurement report that 50% of the grind distribution is coarser and 50% is finer than the indicated measured value. The determination of the individual grain size fractions is carried out using the air jet sieve method according to DIN 10 765. The aforementioned regulations refer to the current version at the time of priority of the present invention. “Fine” Grinding Degree All grain sizes up to a maximum of 0.25 mm result in a proportion of more than 50%. “Medium” Grinding Degree The grain size between 0.25 mm and 0.71 mm result in a proportion of more than 50%. “Coarse” Grinding Degree All grain sizes larger than 0.71 mm result in a proportion of more than 50%. For the present method, a “medium” grinding degree or, particularly preferably, a “coarse” grinding degree is recommended. It is recommended that the plunger brings the coffee powder into shape before the brewing process, so that the volume of the brewing chamber is reduced during the shaping process and for its purpose. The plunger is retracted again after the first bringing into shape and thus does not rest on the ground coffee. This creates a large brewing chamber in which there is more space for the ground coffee to swell when it comes into contact with water. At the same time, non-compacted ground coffee has a lower flow resistance. With this method of operation, one can assume an uncompacted flow behavior. When making conventional filter coffee in a coffee filter, on the other hand, the coffee powder often has to settle first, which takes additional time. Furthermore, it is advantageous if the plunger is retracted before the brewing process so that the volume of the brewing chamber expands again, preferably by at least 100% compared to the volume in the shaped state, so that slow extraction and low-pressure passage of the water is possible. It is advantageous if the plunger remains in a rest position during the entire brewing process. The plunger can also be moved during pre-brewing and/or post-brewing. At least during a brewing phase, a slow extraction is recommended. In addition, the fully automatic coffee machine may have a filter, e.g., a sieve and, in particular, a CIP-capable permanent filter. A change in the brewing phases can be made in particular by detecting a conductivity and/or a refractive index, with a measuring sensor for detection being arranged downstream of the brewing unit in terms of flow, so that the measurement result of the finished coffee, i.e. the end product, is taken as the basis for the change. Alternatively and preferably, the measuring sensor can also be arranged in front of the brewing unit in order to influence the properties while the coffee is still being prepared. Particularly preferably, a change in the brewing phases can be set by detecting a supplied amount of water, taking into account the supplied amount of ground coffee. The supplied amount of ground coffee can be taken into account, for example, as part of an adjustment of the grinding capacity. The grinding capacity in mg/s at a preset grinding degree can be adjusted to the amount of water for a specific volume of filter coffee at the customer's request. Furthermore, the brewing pressure during the brewing process is preferably less than 2.5 bar. Preferably, the brewing chamber is closed except for an outlet for coffee during the brewing process. Optionally, an inlet for hot water can also be open. Preferably, the flow rate is adjusted in steps during the brewing process to change between two brewing phases. Preferably, the change between all further brewing phases of the brewing process can also be adjusted in steps. The fully automatic coffee machine can also have a bypass line starting from a hot water boiler to a dispensing unit with one or more control elements, wherein a dispensing of hot water takes place, preferably simultaneously with the brewing process and/or the dispensing of coffee from the brewing unit, to achieve a predetermined coffee volume. One or more valves can be used as control elements. Each valve defines a different flow rate. According to the invention, there is also a fully automatic coffee machine comprising at least one brewing unit with a linearly displaceable plunger for setting a volume of a brewing chamber of the brewing unit and a control and/or evaluation unit which is set up to carry out a method according to the invention. The fully automatic coffee maker can advantageously have a hot water boiler, wherein a flow rate limiter for setting a flow rate is arranged between the hot water boiler and the brewing unit. This enables the flow rate to be set after the respective first, second and/or third brewing phase and/or possibly further optional brewing phases. The flow rate limiter can have a plurality of control elements, e.g. valves, which are designed for stepped adjustment of the flow rate to ensure a brewing process with several brewing phases with different flow rates. A stepped adjustment allows a very direct setting of a desired flow rate, whereas a stepless adjustment often allows a less optimal dosing due to an overrun that is difficult to detect. In the following, the invention is explained in more detail by reference to an exemplary embodiment of a method according to the invention with the aid of the following figures, wherein: FIG. 1 a shows a schematic structure of a first variant of a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention; FIG. 1 b shows a schematic structure of a second variant of a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention; FIG. 1 c shows a schematic structure of a third variant of a fully automatic coffee machine according to the invention; FIGS. 2 a - g show detailed views of a brewing unit of the fully automatic coffee machine with a plunger in different operating positions during execution of the method according to the invention; FIG. 3 shows a measurement of various physical quantities as a function of the course of the brewing process when carrying out the method according to the invention; FIG. 4 shows a measurement diagram of an exemplary coffee extraction, e.g. on the basis of a conductivity, over a brewing process with several brewing phases according to a first embodiment variant of the method according to the invention; and FIG. 5 shows a measurement diagram of an exemplary coffee extraction, e.g. on the basis of a conductivity, over a brewing process with several brewing phases according to a second embodiment variant of the method according to the invention. FIG. 1 shows the basic structure of a fully automatic coffee machine 1 according to the invention. The fully automatic coffee machine 1 has a brewing unit 2 and a hot water boiler 3 as central units. For the supply of water, the fully automatic coffee machine has a water inlet 4 . This can be, for example, a removable water reservoir or a connection to a water pipe. Furthermore, the automatic coffee machine 1 has a water pump 5 for conveying the supplied water into the hot water boiler 3 . In addition, the fully automatic coffee machine 1 has a measuring device for determining the flow rate 6 . In the present exemplary embodiment, this is arranged upstream of the hot water boiler 3 in terms of flow and enables the water feed quantity into the boiler to be controlled at this position. Alternatively or additionally, an analog measuring device for flow rate determination can also be arranged between the hot water boiler 3 and the brewing unit 2 and/or downstream of the brewing unit 2 in terms of flow. The measuring device for determining the flow rate 6 can advantageously be designed as an impeller meter. Furthermore, the supply line upstream of the hot water boiler 3 has a rebound valve 7 . The hot water boiler 3 then heats the supplied water to a temperature of preferably 80-96° C. Within this temperature range, the water temperature can be variably adjusted according to the desired hot beverage. Furthermore, the fully automatic coffee machine can have a non-displayed line for adding cold water in order to achieve a product-specific setting of the brewing temperature. The water heated in this way is then fed to the brewing unit 2 , preferably in metered quantities. If the water boiler 3 or alternatively also the brewing unit 2 has not already implemented a metering device, a flow rate limiter 8 can be provided between the water boiler 3 and the brewing unit 2 for more precise metering of the flow rates of hot water required in the respective method steps. The flow rate limiter of FIG. 1 a enables a stepped adjustment, in particular a stepped control, of the flow rate of the hot water supplied to the brewing unit 2 . For this purpose, three brewing valves 8 a - 8 c are provided in each case in FIG. 1 a , wherein each of the brewing valves can have a different cross-section and consequently represents a different flow rate into the brewing unit. Preferably, one brewing valve is open in each case, while the other two brewing valves are closed. In the variant of FIG. 1 b , the flow rate limiter 8 is implemented by two brewing valves 8 a and 8 b . Here, too, at least three flow rates can be set in total, by opening each of the individual brewing valves 8 a or 8 b or by simultaneously opening both valves 8 a and 8 b . Preferably, in the variant of FIG. 1 b , the cross-sections and thus flow rates downstream of the valve are continuously adjustable, e.g., manually adjusted needle valves. Thus a stepless flow rate adjustment of an otherwise step-set supply of a water quantity is possible. FIG. 1 c discloses a variant in which a stepless valve 8 d is used to adjust the flow rate. However, a stepwise change of the flow rates is preferred in order to enable a direct and fast regulation. Furthermore, for redundancy reasons, in the case of the stepped variant, in the event of failure of a valve, emergency operation can still be ensured for coffee withdrawal with reduced selection options. In addition, the stepped setting of FIGS. 8 a and 8 b enables fast feeding and discharging with clear or unambiguous switching states. While a pressure limiter is often provided at this point in espresso machines, a flow rate limiter, e.g. a throttle, preferably a variably controllable throttle, is preferred here. Alternatively, the functions of a pressure limiter and a flow rate limiter can also be implemented together in one control element, so that the fully automatic coffee machine can be used in a more versatile way, i.e. for the production of more coffee variants. The brewing unit 2 preferably has a brewing chamber 12 whose volume can be adjusted by a linearly movable plunger 11 . The plunger position is variably adjustable. Furthermore, the brewing unit 2 has a filter 15 , preferably a permanent filter. The permanent filter is preferably CIP-capable. The permanent filter may in particular be a microfine sieve. Particularly preferably, the sieve may have at least 30,000 holes, preferably at least 40,000 holes, per 1.*10 3 mm. The brewing unit can be filled with ground coffee by manual filling, i.e. by direct insertion of the ground coffee, e.g. via a feed chute, or by grinding whole beans immediately before feeding them into the brewing unit. For this purpose, the fully automatic coffee machine may have a non-displayed coffee grinder. Since ground coffee for filter coffee usually has a coarser grinding degree than espresso powder, it is advantageous if the integrated coffee grinder is equipped to produce a variable grinding degree. This is matched to the type of coffee and the type of filter, in particular the permanent filter. Corresponding parameters are, for example, the degree of fineness or the distribution. Further details of a coffee grinder with a variable grinding degree can be found in DIN 44539 (in the current version at the time of the present application), which is referenced in the context of the present application. The grinding degree can be variably adjusted, for example, by varying the grinding time, speed, pressure of the grinding elements and/or roughness of the grinding elements. In addition or as an alternative to the flow rate limiter 8 , the fully automatic coffee machine 1 can have a measuring sensor 9 , in particular a physical measuring sensor for determining a coffee property. This is preferably arranged downstream of the brewing unit 2 in terms of flow. This coffee property can preferably be the conductivity, the refractive index, the pressure and/or the temperature. A variant of the measurement in this context is described in detail, inter alia, in DE 10 2018 116 306 A1, to which reference is hereby made. Alternatively and particularly preferably, the measuring sensor can also determine a volumetric flow of coffee leaving the brewing unit. Finally, the coffee is forwarded to a dispensing unit 10 . In addition, the fully automatic coffee machine 1 may have further blocking and/or diverting valves at various positions. In particular, the fully automatic coffee machine has a bypass line 17 between the hot water boiler 3 and the dispensing unit 10 for supplying hot water to the dispensing unit without this having previously been passed through the brewing unit 2 . In particular, the bypass line 17 enables a reduction of the coffee preparation time due to a parallel supply of hot water to the coffee. In particular, it may be that hardly any flavoring substances are extracted in a post-brewing phase, so that the preparation time is shortened to the desired volume by the supply of hot water. In this case, no bitter substances are supplied via the bypass line 17 , as can be the case with longer extraction times in the brewing unit. Nevertheless, the desired volume can be maintained. The hot water can be supplied to the dispensing unit by several predefined supply rates, wherein control elements 16 , e.g. bypass valves 16 a and 16 b , are provided for setting a flow rate. Preferably, the flow rate and the supply volume can be made in dependence on the values determined by the measuring sensor 9 or in dependence on the flow rates. The operation of the brewing unit 2 and/or the hot water boiler 3 is controlled by a control and/or evaluation unit 13 . The control and/or evaluation unit preferably has a computing unit and a data memory on which one or more data records or databases are stored, which are called up when the method according to the invention is carried out. The method according to the invention for producing a coffee beverage with the characteristics of a filter coffee is carried out according to several steps. In this process, the brewing unit 2 designed as a plunger unit and other core components of the fully automatic coffee machine are used for fully automatic filter coffee production. A previously defined quantity of ground coffee is fed into the brewing chamber 12 and hot water is passed through it, at a low volume flow, with the plunger retracted. The coffee extracted under these conditions has the characteristic features of freshly brewed filter coffee. Investigations have shown that the coffee beverage produced has a directly comparable result to filter coffee production, e.g. in a glass filter. In the following, the method according to the invention is described in detail on the basis of an embodiment variant. In a first step, a user enters a beverage request. The beverage request can be transmitted electronically, e.g. via a cell phone app, or by triggering a control element, e.g. a control panel or a button on the fully automatic coffee machine. Then, in a second optional step, coffee beans are ground to an optimum size for filter coffee by the coffee grinder. In machines with a plurality of storage tanks, e.g. for espresso beans or coffee beans, there is also the option of selecting the type of bean to be fed to the coffee grinder. Alternatively, ground coffee can be fed to the brewing unit by direct insertion—before or after the first step. In a third step FIGS. 2 a - 2 c , the brewing chamber 12 of the fully automatic coffee machine 1 is filled, e.g. by opening a slide 14 , cf. FIGS. 2 a and 2 b , the brewing chamber 12 is opened and ground coffee, cf. FIGS. 2 b and 2 c , is fed in. In FIG. 2 c , the ground coffee is then in the form of a cone. In a fourth step, shown in FIG. 2 c , the brewing chamber is then closed, e.g. by operating the slide 14 , and the brewing chamber 12 is sealed. The plunger 11 of the brewing unit 2 can be operated briefly, depending on the amount of ground coffee, to bring the ground coffee into shape. This is shown in FIG. 2 d . Here, the ground coffee is only slightly compressed, but merely shaped cylindrically in order to achieve a more uniform extraction. The plunger is then returned to its original position to increase the volume of the brewing chamber. Next, the brewing chamber 12 is widened to introduce water so that there is room for the ground coffee to swell upon contact with water. This can be seen in FIGS. 2 d and 2 e. In a fifth step, hot water is supplied at a first flow rate. This is referred to below as the first brewing phase, e.g. in a pre-brewing phase. This involves partial and rapid filling of the brewing chamber. To ensure a phase transition of the aroma substances, a certain holding time can optionally be provided. Preferably, the flow rate during pre-brewing is between 9-12 ml/s. After the rapid feed in the pre-brewing phase, a holding time can be provided in which the flow rate is reduced but the brew valve(s) remain open. This can preferably be at least 3 seconds. Then, in a sixth step, hot water is supplied again in a second brewing phase at a second flow rate. This can be the main brewing phase, for example. Hot water is supplied slowly, preferably at a flow rate of less than 5 ml/s, particularly preferably less than 3 ml/s. Uniform extraction is achieved by the slow flow rate, in which soluble substances are also entrained. At the end of the sixth step, the mass transfer of a large part of the aroma substances into the water is complete. The duration of the brewing phase can be controlled as a function of time, quantity (volume or mass of water supplied), pressure and/or, particularly preferably, conductivity. Finally, in a seventh step, the flow rate is increased again, e.g. to 5-10 ml/s. The terms flow rate or volumetric flow rate are to be understood synonymously in the context of the present application. This third flow rate corresponds to the third brewing phase, which may be the so-called post-brewing phase. This phase is preferred to obtain a balanced extraction result. Finally, in an eighth step, the ground coffee is ejected from the brewing chamber. During the individual brewing phases, the brewing chamber can remain open on the drain side, so that the coffee is dispensed into a coffee cup after each phase, i.e. during preparation. The coffee in the brewing chamber can be fed to the output as required, by closing the plunger. The pressure of 4 bar, or in particular 2.5 bar, is preferably not exceeded during all brewing phases of coffee production. On the contrary, the coffee preparation can be carried out particularly preferably without additional pressure from the plunger 11 during the brewing phases. The phase transition between the different brewing phases can occur as a function of the following physical variables and can vary depending on both the amount of ground coffee and the total amount of water: a) Time-controlled by means of a data set value or by a preset after time x [s] has elapsed. This variant varies in particular with the amount of coffee, the volume of water and/or the desired coffee volume. b) Quantity-controlled by means of a data set value or by a presetting according to/at quantity x [ml]. c) Conductivity-controlled by means of a data set value or by a presetting after falling below a proportion of measured conductivities of substances during the brewing process [mS/cm]. In this variant, it is possible to determine in particular when the proportion of conductive substances has been extracted for the most part. The volumetric flow of warm or hot water during the respective brewing phases can be regulated or controlled and can vary depending on both the amount of ground coffee and the total amount of water. The preparation is preferably carried out “cup by cup”, storage e.g. in an internal hot holder of the fully automatic coffee machine before dispensing is conceivable. The entrainment of large particles (coll. or similar crumbs) from the ground coffee into the beverage is preferably prevented by the use of the filter. The brewing chamber volume can be variably changed automatically, preferably before brewing, and adjusted to the desired output volume of the coffee. Preferably, the brewing pressure can be determined upstream and/or downstream of the brewing chamber 12 for measurement data collection. A specific preparation sequence is given below as one embodiment. Brewing Phases I. 0-8 s [80 ml] Pre-brewing II. 8-40 s [70 ml] Brewing III. 40-70 s [150 ml] Post-brewing Parameter Amount: 300 ml Duration: 70 s Amount weighed: 10 g Conductivity: 2.45 mS/cm (Ø) Brewing pressure: 0.5 bar Brewing temperature: 92° C. The measurement diagrams in FIG. 3 were created under these conditions. In the pre-brewing phase I, a pressure increase can be seen due to the rapid supply of water, wherein a low pressure can be built up by plunger 11 . During the main brewing phase II, it can be seen from the increase in conductivity (FIG. 3 b ) that a large proportion of ingredients are transferred during this phase. The flow rate (FIG. 3 c ) is significantly lower than in the pre-brewing phase I. As can be seen from the pressure curve, the main brewing phase takes place without any significant pressure build-up (FIG. 3 a ). This pressure increases again in post-brewing phase III. The flow speed is also increased. The conductivity is low compared to the main brewing phase and continues to decrease in the course. FIG. 4 shows a first variant in which a brewing process runs in three different brewing phases I, II, III. The volumetric flows Q Brewing a, b and c and thus also the first, second and third flow rates vary depending on the brewing phase. Based on the conductivity, the extraction of flavors can be traced. It can be seen that only a few flavors are extracted, particularly in the third brewing phase III. Preferred flow rates or volumetric flows for the individual brewing phases of FIG. 4 but also for other process variants are as follows: First flow rate: Q Brewing a: 2-5 ml/s Second flow rate: Q Brewing b: 5-10 ml/s Third flow rate: Q Brewing C: 10-15 ml/s FIG. 5 shows an alternative second variant of a method according to the invention in which two brewing phases I and II with identical volumetric flows Q Brewing a are passed through the brewing chamber and in which a third brewing phase III with a different volume flow Q Brewing c is operated simultaneously with a volumetric flow of hot water via a bypass line Q Bypass a. The third brewing phase III is used to extract residual coffee and possibly also some bitter substances. In this third brewing phase III, in addition to residual extraction, optionally also of some bitter substances, the main aim is to achieve a desired volume of coffee. As can be seen from FIG. 5 , the method according to the invention does not necessarily have to include three brewing phases with three different volume flows or flow rates, but it is possible to do so and thereby achieve a more balanced taste. The bypass volume flow Q Bypass b can be switched on, for example, in the second brewing phase II or at the end of the brewing process after completion of the third brewing phase III.

TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates generally to the field of coffee preparation, and more specifically to a new and useful method for brewing coffee in the field of coffee preparation. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 1 is a flowchart representation of a method of one embodiment; FIG. 2 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method; FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of a coffee brewing machine of one embodiment of the invention; FIG. 4 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method; FIG. 5 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method; FIGS. 6A and 6B are graphical representations of one variation of the method; and FIG. 7 is a flowchart representation of one variation of the method. DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS The following description of the embodiment of the invention is not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use this invention. 1. First Method and Applications As shown in FIG. 1, a method for brewing coffee at a coffee brewing machine includes: identifying a coffee bean from data derived from a canister containing the coffee bean in Block S 110 ; retrieving a recipe for the coffee bean in Block S 120 , the recipe specified by a coffee roaster supplying the coffee bean; identifying a grind profile of the coffee bean in Block S 130 ; setting brewing parameters at the coffee brewing machine based on the recipe and the grind profile of the coffee bean in Block S 140 , the brewing parameters including a brew temperature and a steep time; and controlling the coffee brewing machine according to the brewing parameters to brew the cup of coffee from the coffee bean in Block S 150 . As shown in FIG. 7, one variation of first method S 100 for brewing a cup of coffee at a coffee brewing machine includes: receiving a coffee source identifier in Block S 110 ; retrieving a recipe for brewing a coffee bean based on the coffee source identifier in Block S 120 ; initiating a brew cycle in Block S 142 ; heating water in a boiler to a target temperature specified by the recipe in Block S 152 ; metering a volume of water from the boiler into a brew chamber in Block S 154 ; heating the brew chamber to maintain the volume of water near the target temperature in Block S 160 ; according to the recipe, displaying an agitation instruction at a first time during the brew cycle in Block—S 170 ; according to the recipe, triggering a first alarm to cease agitation at a second time during the brew cycle in Block S 172 ; and according to the recipe, triggering a second alarm to dispense fluid from the brew chamber at a third time during the brew cycle in Block S 180 . First method S 100 functions to set and control brewing parameters for a coffee bean based on a predetermined coffee recipe to enable accurate and repeatable replication of a coffee experience, such as defined by a coffee roaster supplying the coffee bean. In particular, first method S 100 can enable a coffee roaster to refine and set a specific brewing recipe for his coffee bean, such as on a bean type basis, on a roast batch number basis, or even on a per-pound of coffee basis, thereby providing the coffee roaster with controls to predetermine and remotely (and asynchronously) oversee the flavor of every cup of coffee brewed with his coffee beans, whether in a local coffee shop, in a remote café, or in a private residence. First method S 100 can enable this functionality by identifying a particular whole or ground coffee bean selected for an upcoming brew cycle, such as based on an identifier applied to packaging containing the bean or based on a selection for the coffee bean entered manually into the coffee brewing machine. First method S 100 then retrieves a brew recipe specific to the identified coffee bean, such as from local memory or from a remote database of coffee brewing recipes. Alternatively, first method S 100 can extract the recipe directly from the coffee bean packaging (e.g., a one-pound coffee bag, a coffee tin), such as by reading and translating a quick-response (QR) code, a bar code, a RFID tag, or other embedded code applied or printed onto the packaging. First method S 100 then sets brewing parameters to brew cup, pot, or other volume of coffee with the coffee bean (i.e., a brew cycle) at the coffee brewing machine. For example, first method S 100 can account for a current state of the coffee brewing machine or a local coffee grinder (e.g., hours, wear), water quality, environmental conditions, or coffee bean quality (e.g., age, moisture content), etc. to map the recipe to the coffee brewing machine for the current brew cycle. First method S 100 is described generally in the context of brewing coffee. For example, first method S 100 can control various parameters to accurately and repeatably recreate a coffee flavor experience—as defined by an affiliated coffee roaster—from freshly-ground whole coffee beans. However, first method S 100 can also be applicable to brewing tea or to brewing any other hot to cold beverage. Furthermore, first method S 100 is described generally in the context of replicating a coffee experience defined by a coffee roaster by accurately and repeatedly executing a recipe set by the roaster for the particular coffee bean. However, any other entity can create, modify, or set a recipe for brewing a coffee bean (or other steeping material), such as a café manager, a trained barista, a taste representative of a restaurant that serves its own “brew” of a common coffee, a hotel manager, a representative of a catering service, or any other representative of a food- or drink-related business or service in order to customize the recipe for the business or service. A user can also create, modify, or set the recipe and then share the recipe with other users (e.g., other cafés, other baristas), such as over a social networking system, through an online forum, or via an execution file shared via email. 2. Coffee Brewing Machine Blocks of first method S 100 can execute on a coffee brewing machine capable of automatically controlling brew time, brew temperature, brewing pressure, agitation, and water-to-coffee-ground ratio controls and/or capable of interfacing with a human user (e.g., a barista) to guide executing of the specific recipe for the coffee bean. For example, Blocks of first method S 100 can be implemented by a coffee brewing machine incorporating the brewing system described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0186456, published on 26 Jul. 2012, which is incorporated in its entirety by this reference. In another example shown in FIG. 3, the coffee brewing machine 100 includes an input module 110 for a receiving a coffee bean selection, a water reservoir 120 , a boiler 130 that heats water received from the reservoir 120 , a first temperature sensor 131 that measures water temperature in the boiler 130 , a brew chamber 140 in which water is steeped with coffee grounds, a pump 150 that dispenses heated water into the brew chamber 140 , heater that heats fluid in the brew chamber 140 during brew cycles, a second temperature sensor 141 that measures fluid temperature in the brew chamber 140 , a valve 142 in the base of the brew chamber 140 to dispense fluid out of the brew chamber 140 , a manually-operated piston 170 that forces fluid out of the brew chamber 140 through a filter between the valve 142 and the brew chamber 140 , a display 112 that presents brewing instructions to a user, an audio driver 114 that delivers audible cues to the user, and a processor 160 that controls the foregoing components of the coffee brewing machine 100 to brew the selected coffee bean automatically or with manually assistance. In this example, the input module can include an optical sensor, and the processor 160 can communicate with the optical sensor to read a QR code on the coffee packaging, interface with a wireless communication module within the coffee brewing machine 100 to retrieve a coffee brewing recipe from a remote server based on the QR code, set brewing parameters based on the retrieved brewing recipe (and other measured or determined variables at or near the coffee brewing machine 100 ), and applies the coffee brewing parameters through the foregoing components of the coffee brewing machine 100 during the brew cycle. However, the coffee brewing machine 100 can be of any other suitable form, such as a large professional coffee brewing machine for café use, an under-counter coffee brewing machine, or a small residential coffee brewing machine for a private or home use. The brewing machine can also source water from a plumbed line or tap into a commercial or residential plumbing system or from a reservoir within the brewing machine that is refilled manually. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 2, one or more Blocks of first method S 100 can be execute on a discrete computing device in communication with the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one example in which the coffee brewing machine 100 is a residential coffee brewing machine, a user can open a native application (or an application within a web browser) executing on his mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet) to scan a QR code printed on a coffee bag, and the native application can transmit data extracted from the QR code to a remote server to retrieve the coffee brewing recipe and then upload the received recipe to the user's coffee brewing machine, such as over Wi-Fi, cellular, or Bluetooth communication protocol. Alternatively, the native application can trigger the remote server to push the recipe directly to the coffee brewing machine 100 . The coffee brewing machine 100 can then execute other Blocks of first method S 100 to brew the coffee bean according to the received recipe and/or brewing parameters. In this example, the native application can also handle wired or wireless communications with the coffee brewing machine 100 to track and store a serial number, a model number, age, total hours of use, gallons of water used, actual and target temperature of the boiler 130 and the brew chamber 140 in the coffee brewing machine 100 , and/or other information pertaining to the coffee brewing machine 100 . The native application can similarly access local information, such as time, weather, humidity, temperature, and location from sensors integrated into the mobile computing device (e.g., a thermistor, a global positioning system (GPS) sensor) and/or downloaded from a local weather tower or an online weather database. The native application can thus adjust brewing parameters for the upcoming brew cycle based on machine and environmental information. However, the mobile computing device and the coffee brewing machine 100 can cooperate in any other way to execute Blocks of first method S 100 . Blocks of first method S 100 can additionally or alternatively be implemented by a remote computer system, such as a remote server in communication with the coffee brewing machine 100 or with a network of coffee brewing machines linked through an Internet or Ethernet connection. The computer system can be a cloud-based computer (e.g., Amazon EC2), a mainframe computer system, a grid-computer system, or any other suitable computer system. For example, the computer system can be a remote server that communicates with one or more coffee brewing machines over HTTP (or TCP or UDP) protocols through a web service (e.g., Amazon AWS). The computer system can thus receive recipe, roaster, coffee brewing machine, coffee grinder, environmental, and other data from and transmit parameters, recipe information, etc. to the coffee brewing machine 100 , a coffee grinder, a user's mobile computing device, etc., such as over an Internet, Ethernet, cellular, Wi-Fi, satellite, or other suitable connection. However, Blocks of first method S 100 can be implemented by any other one or more devices and in any other suitable way. 3. Coffee Bean Identifier Block S 110 of first method S 100 recites receiving a coffee source identifier. Generally, Block S 110 functions to collect data identifying the coffee bean to be brewed and to pass these data to Block S 120 , which selects a particular brew recipe corresponding to the coffee bean for an upcoming brew cycle on the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one implementation, Block S 110 automatically identifies a coffee bean from data collected from the packaging containing the coffee bean. In particular, in this implementation, Block S 110 identifies the coffee bean that is to be brewed in the upcoming brew cycle by extracting identifying information directly from the coffee bean packaging—such as from a one-pound coffee bag or from a coffee tin—containing whole coffee beans or coffee grounds. As described below, Block S 110 can cooperate with Block S 120 to extract or retrieve a recipe for the coffee directly from the packaging containing the coffee bean. Alternatively, Block S 110 can retrieve a coffee source identifier—such as a serial number or address unique to the packaging, the coffee bean roast batch, or to the roaster supplying the coffee bean—and Block S 120 can reference the coffee source identifier to a local or remote database of coffee beans to identify the specific coffee bean and to retrieve the corresponding recipe. In this implementation, Block S 110 downloads a coffee source identifier from a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, a near-field communication (NFC) tag, or any other suitable wireless transmitter arranged on the packaging. For example, the coffee brewing machine 100 can include an RFID reader, an NFC reader, or an other radio-based wireless scanner or receiver, and Block S 110 can interface with this receiver to collect the coffee source identifier from the coffee packaging, such as when a user swipes the coffee packaging over the receiver. In particular, Block S 110 can cooperate with Block S 120 to download the recipe directly from wireless transmitter arranged on the coffee bean packaging. Alternatively, Block S 110 can download a unique code (e.g., an alphanumeric sequence) from the wireless transmitter arranged on the coffee bean packaging and pass the code to a remote server that identifies and selects the corresponding recipe, and Block S 120 can then receive the recipe back from the remote server. In this implementation, Block S 110 can similarly execute on or interface with a receiver integrated into a user's mobile computing device to retrieve the coffee source identifier from the coffee bean packaging. Alternatively, in this implementation, the coffee brewing machine 100 includes an optical sensor (e.g., a camera), and Block S 110 interfaces with the optical sensor can capture an input of the coffee bean packaging and implements machine vision to identify a QR code, a bar code, a serial number, or other coffee source identifier printed on or applied to the packaging. For example, Block S 110 can implement optical character recognition to extract coffee-related information from an image of a portion of the bag on which the QR code, bar code, or serial number, etc. is arranged. In this example, Block S 110 can control the optical sensor to automatically capture the image when a user holds the coffee packaging in front of the optical sensor. Block S 110 can thus cooperate with Block S 120 and the optical sensor to read the recipe directly off of the packing. Block S 110 can alternatively read the coffee source identifier, such as a name, a roast batch number, a roaster, a roast date, and/or a serial number, directly off of the packaging, and Block S 120 can pass any one or more of these data to local memory or to a remote server to collect the corresponding recipe. Similarly, Block S 110 can identify a code arranged on the packaging in the image, such as a barcode or a QR code, and translate the identified code into coffee source identifier (e.g., an alphanumeric sequence), and Block S 120 can similarly handle the coffee source identifier to collect the recipe for the coffee bean. For example, Block S 110 can read a quick-response code applied onto the coffee bag with an optical sensor coupled to the coffee brewing machine 100 and identify a coffee roaster supplying the coffee bean and a roast date of the coffee bean from the quick-response code, and Block S 120 can download the recipe assigned to the coffee bean for the roast date by the coffee roaster. In another implementation, Block S 110 cooperates with the input module 110 to receive manual entry of a name, an identification number, a batch number, a serial number, or any other suitable coffee source identifier related to the coffee bean selected from the upcoming brew cycle. For example, the coffee brewing machine 100 can include a display 112 and a discrete input region (e.g., a switch or button), and Block S 110 can control the display 112 to render a menu of coffee bean recipes stored locally on the coffee brewing machine 100 . In this example, the display 112 can cycle through the available recipes based on inputs into the input region, and Block S 120 can retrieve a recipe corresponding to a selection by the user. Thus, as in this example, Block S 110 can receive a manual selection for the coffee bean from a list of coffee beans. Block S 110 can similarly control a touchscreen or an analog interface on the coffee brewing machine 100 to collect a manual selection of a particular coffee bean affiliated with a brewing recipe stored locally or remotely. Block S 110 can also interface with the user's mobile computing device to receive a selection for the coffee bean. Alternatively, Block S 110 can receive manual entry of a code, such as a numeric or alphanumeric code printed directly onto the packaging or printed onto a sticker applied to the packing. However, Block S 110 can receive an identifier of the whole or pre-ground coffee bean in any other suitable way. In any of the foregoing implementations, Block S 110 can receive the coffee source identifier that defines a pointer to a particular coffee bean (e.g., a particular roast) from a particular coffee roaster, a roast date of the particular coffee bean, a batch roast number of the particular coffee bean, and/or a serial number of the packaging containing the particular coffee bean. Block S 110 can thus receive one or more levels (or resolutions) of identifiers of the coffee bean to be brewed in the upcoming brew cycle, such as shown in FIG. 5. In particular, Block S 110 can handle the coffee source identifier defining one of more of a general type of roast that is common to thousands of pounds of beans from the roaster annually, a date of roast that is common to hundreds of pounds of beans roasted by the roaster on one day (or week or other roast period), a roast batch number that is unique to fifteen pounds (15 lbs.) of coffee beans, or a coffee packaging serial number that is unique to one pound (or any similar quantity) of coffee beans. However, Block S 110 can collect, extract, and/or receive the coffee source identifier defining any other identifier for the coffee bean in any other format. 4. Recipe Block S 120 of first method S 100 recites retrieving a recipe for brewing a coffee bean based on the coffee source identifier. (Block S 120 of first method S 100 can similarly recite retrieving a recipe for the coffee bean, the recipe specified by a roaster associated with the coffee bean.) Generally, Block S 120 functions to access a particular coffee brewing recipe specific to the coffee bean—as specified by a coffee roaster—based on the coffee source identifier collected in Block S 110 . As described above, the recipe can be defined by the roaster as a target experience for a cup of coffee brewed from the particular coffee beans. Because each coffee bean harvest can be different, because each roaster can roast beans differently, because the same roaster can roast batches of beans differently, and because variations may exist even amongst beans within the same roast batch from the same roaster and sourced from the same coffee bean harvest, the target experience can be generic to one coffee roast supplied by the roaster (e.g., all dark roast from the roaster), specific to one coffee roast supplied by the roaster for one coffee harvest or coffee season, specific to one roast date (e.g., a day or week) for coffee beans from the roaster, specific to one roast batch number for coffee beans from the roaster, or specific to a single package of coffee beans from the roaster. Generally, the recipe can define a set of quantitative (and qualitative) brewing parameters to (e.g., brew temperature, brew temperature profile, brewing duration, brew or initial water volume, coffee ground contact time with water per unit area, filter medium, filter size, brewing pressure, coffee grind profile, agitation profile, coffee ground-to-water ratio, water quality, user prompts or alarms, recipe expiration date, etc.) that, when executed (within a certain tolerance), achieve a target tasting experience (e.g., flavor, aroma, caffeine content, acidity, bitterness, sweetness, aftertaste, approach, body, finish) from a cup of coffee brewed with the coffee bean. In one implementation, the recipe specifies a static base set of brewing parameters including a brew temperature, start and stop times for agitation, and a steep time (i.e., a time from initiation of a brew cycle to dispensation of fluid from the brew chamber 140 ). Subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can thus execute this limited set of brewing parameters for each brew cycle in which the corresponding coffee bean is used, such as automatically through actuators and sensors incorporated into the coffee brewing machine 100 or by guiding manual execution of one or more brewing parameters at the coffee brewing machine 100 during the brew cycle, as described below. The recipe can also specify a particular filter type and/or size to brew the coffee bean, such as a metal filter or a paper filter of a particular porosity and/or flow rate, as well as additional agitation periods and/or types of agitation, such as stirring or punching (i.e., pushing floating particulate downward, or “breaking the crust”). The recipe can further define a grind profile for coffee beans, such as a grind size and/or a threshold deviation of particulate size in the coffee grounds from the grind size. In the foregoing implementation, the coffee brewing machine 100 can be preset to meter a particular volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 for all brew cycles, and all brew cycles can be specify a static volume or weight of coffee grounds. Alternatively, the recipe can specify a specific ratio of coffee grounds to water (e.g., by mass, weight, or volume ratio). The recipe can thus specify an algorithm for calculating a particular mass, weight, or volume of coffee grounds for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 during a brew cycle for the preset static brew volume of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Similarly, a subsequent Block of first method S 100 can receive a final brew volume (i.e., a final volume of brewed coffee dispensed from the brew chamber 140 during a brew cycle), and the recipe can define an algorithm for calculating an amount of water and an amount of coffee grounds for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 , such as based on a target ratio of coffee grounds to water during the steeping period and a water retention capacity of the grounds (e.g., a volume of water retained per unit weight of dry grounds). The recipe can further include one or more algorithms for calculating or adjusting final brewing parameters (e.g., agitation type and time, steep time, brew temperature or profile, etc.) based on additional variables, such as grind profile or distribution, bean age, location, barometric pressure, ambient air temperature to account for additional factors that may effect flavor of coffee brewed with the coffee beans. For example, the recipe can specify algorithms than adjust brewing parameters based on a make and model, hours, and/or grinder settings of a local (e.g., adjacent or connected) coffee grinder, based on a location of the coffee brewing machine 100 , which may indicate available water quality, elevation or barometric pressure, based on the ambient air temperature, or based on the make and model of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can thus normalize brewing parameters for the upcoming brew cycle to account for any one or more of these variables. In this example, the recipe can include ambient environmental conditions and brewing parameters used by the roaster when formulating the recipe for the coffee bean, such as brew time, brew temperature, brew pressure, agitation time(s) and type(s), and water-to-coffee-ground ratio. Subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can define these parameters as baseline parameters and then adjust the baseline parameters according to one or more algorithms in the recipe based on differences between the ambient environmental conditions during formulation of the recipe and present ambient environmental conditions at the coffee brewing machine 100 in preparation for the upcoming brew cycle. As shown in FIG. 4, in one example process flow, the roaster roasts a batch (e.g., 100 lbs.) of coffee beans and dials in a recipe for the batch by brewing and tasting various cups of coffee with coffee beans from the batch. The roaster then uploads the recipe specific to the batch to a server and prints sticky labels with QR codes that point to the recipe. The roaster then applies the sticky labels to 1 lb. paper coffee bags and fills the bags with whole coffee beans from the roast batch. A customer (e.g., a coffee buyer for a café) then purchases one of the 1 lb. bags of coffee. When the QR code on the bag is later read with a scanner integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 , the coffee brewing machine 100 executes Block S 110 to identity the batch number of the coffee bean in the bag and executes Block S 120 to retrieve the recipe from the remote server before implemented the recipe in subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 to brew a cup of coffee with the coffee bean. As in the foregoing example process flow, Block S 110 can receive the identifier directly from a tag or other wireless transmitter arranged on the coffee packaging, or Block S 110 can extract the identifier from the coffee packaging, such as by implementing machine vision techniques to read a code from an image of the packaging as described above. Block S 120 can then apply the identifier to a local or remote database of recipes to retrieve a particular recipe specific to the coffee bean selected for the upcoming brew cycle. In this implementation, because the recipe is stored electronically and separate from the coffee packaging (e.g., on a remote server), the roaster can update, modify, or tweak the recipe over time, and Block S 120 can retrieve the current (i.e., most up-to-date) recipe specific to the beans to be roasted. Similarly, as in the second method described below, when the roaster enters or modifies a brew recipe for a particular coffee bean, the new or updated brew recipe can be pushed automatically to existing coffee brewing machines, such as to specific coffee brewing machines affiliated (e.g., through contract) with the roaster and/or designated for brewing the particular coffee bean. However, Block S 110 can receive an identifier for the coffee bean in any other way and in any other format, and Block S 120 can function in any other way to retrieve the recipe specific to the coffee bean. 5. Grind Profile One variation of first method S 100 includes Block S 130 , which recites identifying a grind profile of the coffee bean. Generally, because grind profile can affect flavor of a cup of coffee, Block S 130 functions to estimate an average grind size and standard deviation (i.e., a grind profile distribution) of coffee grounds ground from the coffee bean. In one implementation, Block S 130 interfaces with an optical sensor to collect an image of dry grounds and implements machine vision to estimate average grind size and standard deviation of the coffee grounds from the image. For example, an optical sensor integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 or into the user's mobile computing device can capture an image of grounds prior to dispensation of the grounds in the brew chamber 140 of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Alternatively, Block S 130 can estimate the grind profile of the coffee bean based on the make, model, and/or age (e.g., hours of use) of a coffee grinder near the coffee brewing machine 100 and used to grind the coffee bean. For example, Block S 130 can pass a make and model of the coffee grinder to a remote database container coffee grinder data and thus retrieve a particular shape, size, and/or orientation of burrs equipped in the particular coffee grinder used to grind the current coffee bean. For example, a coffee grinder equipped with flat burrs may produce a tighter grind profile than a coffee grinder equipped with round burrs, a coffee grinder equipped with vertically-oriented burrs may produce a tighter grind profile than a coffee grinder equipped with horizontally-oriented burrs, and a coffee grinder equipped with larger burrs may produce a tighter grind profile than a coffee grinder equipped with smaller burrs. Block S 130 can thus predict the grind profile of coffee grounds output from the coffee grinder according to these burr parameters. Block S 130 can also retrieve a coradiality, a burr material (e.g., sintered ceramic or ground steel), burr coating, burr type (e.g., crushing or cutting), burr age, and/or a date of most recent burr-replacement at the coffee grinder and estimate the grind profile of the coffee grounds accordingly. In particular, grind profile standard deviation can be very high for brand new burrs and decrease as the burrs are “broken in.” However, as the coffee grinder continues to be used, the burrs eventually begin to wear out, thus yielding increasingly less uniform grind sizes. For example, once a new coffee grinder is broken in, it may yield grind profiles with relatively small standard deviations (such as shown in FIG. 6A), and older coffee grinders (i.e., coffee grinders with many hours of use) can yield grind profiles with relatively large standard deviations (such as shown in FIG. 6B). Block S 130 can thus implement an algorithm or model linking grind profile standard deviation to coffee grinder age or use to estimate the grind profile distribution of the coffee grounds prior to brewing. For example, Block can implement a generic coffee grinder wear model to estimate grind profile standard deviation of grounds output from any coffee grinder. Alternatively, because coffee grinders from different manufacturers or different models of coffee grinders from the same manufacturer may wear differently, Block S 130 can access a grinder wear model specific to the particular grinder used to grind the coffee bean prior to the brew cycle, such as by retrieving the grind model from a remote server based on a grinder make, model, and/or serial number entered into the user's mobile computing device or into the coffee brewing machine 100 manually or collected automatically from the grinder over wireless communication. In the foregoing implementation, Block S 130 can interface with a wireless communication module with the coffee brewing machine 100 (or within the user's mobile computing device) to download a make, model serial number, and/or hours of operation directly from the coffee grinder, such as over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth communication protocol. Alternatively, Block S 130 can receive a manual entry of grinder hours of operation or other related data and estimate the grind distribution of grounds output from the coffee grinder. Block S 130 can thus predict a grind profile for the coffee bean that is ground fresh and local to the coffee brewing machine 100 , that is ground at a particular machine or by a particular grocer, coffee distributor, or roaster, etc. Alternatively, the roaster can grind the coffee bean and dispense coffee grounds into the coffee packaging prior to sale. In this process flow, Block S 130 can communicate with the roaster to retrieve grind profile data for the coffee bean, such as by downloading a grind data uploaded by the roaster to a grind database accessible by the coffee brewing machine 100 over the Internet. Block can similarly retrieve coffee grinder make, model, and/or hours of operation data from a grinder user by the roaster to grind the coffee to estimate the grind profile for the pre-ground beans, such as with a method described above. Block S 130 can also prompt the user to grind the coffee bean to a particular size. For example, Block S 130 can prompt a user to grind the coffee bean to a particular size specified in the recipe (e.g., a size selected by the roaster and stored with the recipe). In this example, Block S 130 can interface with a digital display 112 incorporated into the coffee brewing machine 100 to render an instruction for selecting a particular grind size at a local coffee grinder. Block S 130 can also interface with the digital display 112 to render an instruction for dispensing a particular weight of coffee grounds (of the particular grind size) into the brew chamber 140 , such as based on the ratio of coffee grounds to water specified in the recipe and/or based on a final brew volume selected by the user. Block S 134 can similarly transmit a grind setting and/or a coffee grind weight to a local coffee grinder, such as a grind setting specified in the recipe and a grind weight based on the selection for the final brew volume. Block S 130 can also adjust the prompted grind size according to the measured or estimated grind profile distribution from the local coffee grinder. Block S 130 can additionally or alternatively cooperate with other Blocks of first method S 100 to adjust the prompted grind size to accommodate for other variables (e.g., ambient temperature, water quality) or to adjust other brewing parameters to compensate for an available ground size and distribution from the grinder. However, Block S 130 can identify a grind profile of the coffee bean, prompt the user to grind the coffee bean to a particular grind size, or automatically set an output of a local coffee grinder in any other suitable way. 6. Fully-Automated Brewing In one variation, first method S 100 executes brew parameters defined in the recipe and/or refined in Block S 140 described below by interfacing with various sensors and actuators within the coffee brewing machine 100 to automatically brew the selected coffee bean, as shown in FIG. 1. For example, a coffee brewing machine executing this variation of first method S 100 can be installed in a residential setting to automatically—or with limited human involvement—brew coffee for an individual in his home. In this variation, first method S 100 can include Block S 140 , which recites setting brewing parameters based on the recipe and the grind profile of the coffee bean. Generally, Block S 140 functions to adjust brewing parameters specified by the recipe for the upcoming brew cycle to compensate for any number of variables that may affect flavor of the brewed coffee, such as grind profile, freshness of grind, age of beans, local barometric pressure, local humidity, local ambient temperature, and water quality used to brew the cup of coffee. In particular, Block S 140 can adjust brewing parameters set in by the recipe to achieve a coffee experience intended by the coffee roaster despite differences in local conditions (i.e., variables) leading up to the brew cycle. For example, as described above, Block S 140 can set brewing parameters defined in the recipe retrieved in Block S 120 as baseline parameters and adjust these parameters according to differences between current conditions and conditions during the formulation of the recipe. For example, Block S 140 can normalize the roaster's recipe to the current conditions at the coffee brewing machine 100 according to environment conditions, grind profile, water quality, age of the coffee bean, freshness of the grind, etc. In one example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters for the upcoming brew cycle to account for local barometric pressure near the coffee brewing machine 100 . For example, because the free boiling point of water is proportional to barometric pressure, and Block S 140 can decrease a peak or average brew temperature in response to lower detected or received barometric pressure near the coffee brewing machine 100 . In this example, responsive to the lower peak or average brew temperature, Block S 140 can increase brew duration and/or agitation accordingly. Furthermore, because barometric pressure can be linked to altitude and altitude linked to location, Block S 140 can determine the location of the coffee brewing machine 100 , such as by polling a GPS sensor in the coffee brewing machine 100 or a GPS sensor in the user's mobile computing device, and Block S 140 can then access an average local barometric pressure for the location, such as from a lookup table. Alternatively, Block S 140 can interface with a pressure sensor incorporated into the coffee brewing machine 100 to measure the local barometric pressure directly, or Block S 140 can communicate with a weather tower to retrieve a local barometric pressure reading. However, Block S 140 can receive local barometric pressure and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In another example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters to account for the ambient air temperature proximal the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one example, Block S 140 assumes that the temperature of the ground coffee bean is approximately the same temperature as the ambient air temperature, and, for lower detected ambient air temperatures, Block S 140 extends the brew duration (i.e., steep time) and softens a temperature ramp profile within the brew chamber 140 to prevent temperature shock to the coffee grounds. Alternatively, for lower ambient air temperatures, Block S 140 can set a faster temperature ramp in the brew chamber 140 to accommodate the brew chamber 140 , water, and/or coffee grounds that are initially cooler in order to minimize contact between the grounds and the water outside of a particular temperature range. Block S 140 can also adjust a steeping period (and an alarm to notify the user that the cup of coffee is ready) according to a predicted thermal energy flux from the brew chamber 140 based on ambient air temperature, a type of coffee cup (e.g., ceramic, paper) to be used, etc. In one example, Block S 140 interfaces with a thermistor or other temperature sensor within the coffee brewing machine 100 or within the user's mobile computing device to detect the ambient air temperature proximal the coffee brewing machine 100 . However, Block S 140 can receive ambient air temperature and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In yet another example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters to account for a quality of water in use at the coffee brewing machine 100 . In particular, tap and bottled water may contain various minerals that affect flavor, such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride(s), zinc, iron, copper, and fluoride, and Block S 140 can adjust brewing parameters to account for differences in water used by the roaster and water used at the coffee brewing machine 100 . For example, for water with relatively high mineral content, Block S 140 can reduce both brewing (i.e., steeping) time and average brew temperature to curb chemical reactions between metals in the water and acids in the coffee grounds, which can yield salts that affect the flavor of the coffee and/or upset an acid balance in the coffee. In this example, Block S 140 can also cooperate with Block S 130 to prompt the user to use a finer grind to account for the reduced brew time and brew temperature without substantially sacrificing body of the coffee. In a similar example, Block S 140 can set a brewing time and a brewing temperature according to an amount of dissolved solids in the supplied water, which can affect solvent efficiency of the supplied water. Additionally or alternatively, Block S 140 can set higher brew pressures to accommodate for the reduced brew time and temperature. Block S 140 can also interface with a water mineral sensor integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 to determine the mineral content of the water, or Block S 140 can access a tap water profile database to retrieve tap water data based on the location of the coffee brewing machine 100 . Alternatively, the user can enter a type of bottled water or scan a barcode on a bottle of water used to brew the coffee, and Block S 140 can access a bottled water profile database to retrieve water quality data for the selected bottled water. However, Block S 140 can receive any other water quality data and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In another example implementation, Block S 140 adjusts brewing parameters to account for the grind profile of the coffee bean. In particular, the grind profile—or the average size and standard deviation of particles ground from coffee beans—may affect which and to what extent flavors are extracted from each ground over time during a brew cycle. For example, grounds that are smaller or larger than a target size range can yield undesirable or imbalanced flavors, since grounds that are too small may have been severed from particulate that yields complementary flavors and grounds that are too large limit may predominantly yield flavors that stem from larger molecules, thereby upsetting flavor balance of the brew. In particular, ground size can affect permeability of the grounds, thereby affecting the flavor of coffee brewed within the grounds. Therefore, Block S 140 can adjust brewing parameters (e.g., brewing duration, agitation, brew temperature profile, brewing pressure) to control water-to-ground contact time, thereby controlling flavor extraction from the grounds for the current grind profile. For example, for a grind profile with a proper average ground size but a standard deviation of ground size outside of a threshold standard deviation, Block S 140 can increase brewing duration and decrease average brew temperature to selectively extract more flavors from larger grounds during brewing. In another example, for a grind profile with an average ground size greater than a preferred ground size but a proper standard deviation of ground size, Block S 140 can increase average brew temperature, increase agitation, and increase brewing pressure to extract more balanced flavors from the grounds. However, Block S 140 can receive a grind profile of the coffee bean and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In the foregoing example, implementation, Block S 140 can also adjust brewing parameters to account for the age of the coffee bean and/or the freshness of the grounds. In particular, a whole bean may degrade and become stale over time, thus resulting in diminished flavors in a brew. Degradation of flavor from the coffee bean may be further exacerbated if the bean is stored ground rather than whole. Therefore, Block S 140 can implement a degradation algorithm—such as specific to a coffee bean and stored configuration (i.e., whole or ground)—to model changes in flavors extractable from the coffee bean based on age of the coffee bean (i.e., time since roasting). Block S 140 can also access a coffee bean or roaster database to determine an age of the coffee bean based on the roast date, batch number, or a “ready” date (i.e., a number of specified rest days following the roast date). Alternatively, Block S 140 can interface with Block S 110 to extract a roast or ready date directly from the coffee packaging. In one example, for an older and relatively degraded bean, Block S 140 can increase brewing duration, average brew temperature, and average brewing pressure in order to extract more flavor from the bean to compensate for a decrease in extractable flavors from the bean over time. Similarly, Block S 140 can prompt the user to fill the brew chamber with a larger amount (e.g., volume, mass, or weight) of grounds to compensate for older whole coffee beans (e.g., more than two weeks old) or for coffee grounds that were ground outside of a preferred flavor window (e.g., more than 24 hours prior). Block S 140 can also throw a warning and/or notify the user if the coffee bean is too old to yield a cup of coffee that achieves the coffee experience specified by the roaster. However, Block S 140 can receive an age of the coffee bean and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. In another implementation, Block S 140 can adjust the brewing parameters to account for a mass of grounds to be brewed, such as by setting a volume of water to be added to the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 based on the amount of coffee grounds to be brewed. For example, Block S 140 can receive a ratio of water (e.g., in grams) to coffee grounds (e.g., in grams) from the recipe, interface with a scale integrated into the brew chamber 140 to measure a mass of grounds added to the brew chamber 140 , and calculate the volume of water to add to the brew chamber 140 based on the water-to-grounds ratio and the mass of grounds. Alternatively, Block S 140 can receive manual entry of ground mass entered by a user. Yet alternatively, a user can load grounds into the brew chamber 140 with a scoop or known volume, and Block S 140 can estimate the mass of grounds based on manual entry of the number of scoops and a known or estimate density of the coffee ground, such as a density specific to the particular coffee bean as measured by the roaster. Block S 140 can also account for changes in moisture content of the coffee bean over time (e.g., based on the degradation algorithm described above), water absorption volume of the grounds, water absorption rate of the grounds (e.g., based on the grind profile), etc. to estimate a ratio of water added to the brew chamber 140 to water released from the brew chamber 140 upon completion of the brew cycle. For example, Block S 140 can receive a manual entry or user selection of a volume final brew volume (e.g., 4 oz., 8 oz., six cups), calculate a mass of grounds to add to the brew chamber 140 , instruct the user to add the mass of grounds to the brew chamber 140 , and set a volume of water to add to the brew chamber 140 accordingly. However, Block S 140 can receive, estimate, or measure a mass of grounds for consumption during the brew cycle and/or receive a selection for a volume of coffee to output during the brew cycle and adjust brewing parameters accordingly in any other suitable way. Block S 140 can further set a pre-wetting and/or water ingress pulse parameters for dispensing water in to the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 140 can set a pre-wetting parameter to add a first 50 g of water the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 and to set a soak timer for the grounds. In another example, Block S 140 can set a water ingress pulse parameter to add a first 50 g of water at a first time, pause for ten seconds, and then add 250 g of water at a specified interval and flow rate up to a total initial water volume (i.e., based on a determined ratio of water in to coffee out) in Block S 154 . However, Block S 140 can function in any other way to set any other brewing parameter. In this variation, first method S 100 can also include Block S 150 , which recites controlling a coffee brewing machine according to the brewing parameters to brew the coffee bean. Generally, Block S 150 functions to implement brewing parameters set in Block S 140 to brew the coffee bean by monitoring sensors integrated into the coffee brewing machine 100 and controlling actuators within the coffee brewing machine 100 accordingly. Initially, Block S 150 heats water in a boiler 130 to a target temperature and then actuates the pump 150 to dispense a volume of water—set in Block S 140 —into the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 150 can control a pump to displace water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 , interface with a flow sensor arranged along a fluid supply line to the brew chamber 140 to measure the volume of water displaced into the brew chamber 140 , and then power off the pump when the desired dispensed water volume is reached. Once water and grounds are both dispensed into the brew chamber 140 , Block S 150 implements closed-loop feedback to control a heating element coupled to the brew chamber 140 to maintain the temperature of fluid within the brew chamber 140 based on outputs of a temperature sensor 141 coupled to the brew chamber 140 and a brew temperature set in Block S 140 . For example, Block S 150 can control the heating element and the plunger 170 arranged over the brew chamber 140 to implement heating and pressure profiles set in Block S 140 based on outputs of a temperature sensor 141 (e.g., a thermocouple, a contactless laser-based temp sensor) and a pressure sensor arranged in the brew chamber 140 , respectively. In this example, Block S 150 can control the heating element according to a time-dependent temperature profile, such as by initially increasing the temperature of the grounds and water in the brew chamber 140 from room temperature to a preset target temperature of 195° F. over a preset period of time and holding the temperature at 195° F. for a subsequent preset period of time. Block S 150 can also control an impeller, ultrasonic transducer, or other agitator arranged in or in communication with the brew chamber 140 according to an agitation profile parameter set in Block S 140 . In this example, Block S 150 can control the agitator according to a time-dependent agitation profile, such as by agitating the water and grounds in the brew chamber 140 for a first period of time (e.g., thirty seconds) during the brew cycle and then ceasing agitation for the remainder of the brew cycle. Finally, when a water-ground contact period completes—as specified in Block S 140 —Block S 150 can control a valve 142 coupled to the brew chamber 140 to dispense fluid (i.e., brewed coffee) from the brew chamber 140 into a coffee cup, a coffee pot, a thermos, or any other container. Block S 150 can also implement a post-brew rest period parameter set in Block S 140 to notify a user that the coffee is ready to drink or distribute. For example, Block S 140 can specify that the coffee should rest for 90 seconds after brewing and before consuming, such as based on an optimal consumption temperate set by the roaster and an anticipated cooling time related to an ambient air temperature near the coffee brewing machine 100 . Thus, Block S 150 can implement the brewing parameters set in Block S 140 to reduce a possibility of human error during a brew cycle and to enable substantially accurate and repeatable brewing results. Alternatively, Block S 150 can interface with sensors and actuators arranged within the coffee brewing machine 100 to implement brew parameters defined explicitly within the or to implement a combination of brew parameters defined in the recipe and refined in Block S 140 . However, Block S 150 can function in any other suitable way to control a coffee brewing machine according to brewing parameters—assigned to the coffee bean and/or manipulated in Block S 140 according to local parameters and/or user inputs—to brew the coffee bean. However, in this variation, Blocks of first method S 100 can function in any other way to automatically implement parameters specified in a recipe for a particular coffee bean selected for brewing on a coffee brewing machine. 7. Semi-Automated Brew Cycle In another variation, first method S 100 interfaces with various sensors within the coffee brewing machine 100 , controls a set of actuators within the brewing machine to implement a subset of brewing parameters for the brew cycle, and presents instructions (i.e., prompts, directives) to the user to implement remaining brewing parameters for the brew cycle, as shown in FIG. 7. This variation of first method S 100 can therefore control specific variables of a brew cycle, such as brew temperature, and guide a user through operation of the coffee brewing machine 100 to replicate a coffee experience defined by the corresponding roaster without eliminating a manual component of coffee brewing. In particular, in this variation, first method S 100 can control some brewing variables automatically while guiding manual control of other brewing variables to maintain human involvement and an appearance of a trained, professional barista operating the coffee brewing machine 100 to brew coffee. For example, a coffee brewing machine executing this variation of first method S 100 can be installed in a coffee shop or café and used by professional baristas to brew coffee from patrons. This variation of first method S 100 includes Block S 142 , which recites initiating a brew cycle. Generally, Block S 142 functions to begin the brew cycle by locking brewing parameters, such a brew temperature, a brew time, and agitation types and times. For example, Block S 142 can extract these brew parameters directly from the recipe, and subsequent Blocks of first method S 100 can implement these brew parameters during the brew cycle to brew the coffee bean. Block S 142 can also deliver prompts to the user to prepare the coffee brewing machine 100 for the brew cycle and/or receive inputs from the user to adjust the brew parameters. In one example implementation, Block S 142 extracts a filter type from the recipe, as described above, and renders—on the display 112 —an instruction to insert a filter of the filter type into the coffee brewing machine 100 accordingly prior to the initiating the brew cycle. In another example implementation, Block S 142 prompts a user to enter a selection for a final brew volume, such as for a four-ounces, six-ounce, or twelve-ounce pour. Block S 142 can thus set a volume of heating water to be portioned from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 accordingly. In this example implementation, Block S 142 can also calculate a mass, weight, or volume of grounds to be added to the brew chamber 140 based on the final brew volume selection, a water absorption capacity of the grounds, and/or a ratio of water to grounds specified in the recipe, etc., and Block S 142 can then interface with Block S 130 to prompt the user to dispense the calculated amount of coffee grounds into the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 142 can initiate the brew cycle by triggering Block S 152 to heat water in the boiler 130 to a target brew temperature for the coffee bean and render on the display 112 a prompt to select a final brew volume from a set of final volumes (e.g., 4 oz, 6 oz, or 12 oz). Block S 142 can then calculate the corresponding amount of coffee grounds and the volume of water for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 , and Block S 130 can render a text-based instruction on the display 112 to dispense the amount of coffee beans into the brew chamber 140 and to enter an input (e.g., by hitting a “Start” button) when completed. Once a user enters the appropriate input, and Block S 154 can begin to dispense the calculated volume of water into the brew chamber 140 . Alternatively, Block S 142 can initiate the brew cycle by triggering Block S 152 to preheat water in the boiler 130 to the brew temperate, render a prompt on the display 112 to manually dispense a preset amount of coffee grounds into the brew chamber 140 , and then trigger Bock S 154 to portion a preset volume of water into the brew chamber 140 in response to a user input into the coffee brewing machine 100 indicating the grounds were loaded into the brew chamber 140 . However, Block S 142 can function in any other way to initiate a brew cycle. In this variation, first method S 100 also includes Block S 152 , which recites heating water in a boiler 130 to a target temperature specified by the recipe. Generally, Block S 152 controls a heating element coupled to a boiler 130 within the coffee brewing machine 100 to preheat water to the brewing temperature (or to another temperature specified in the recipe) prior to dispensation of a particular volume of water into the brew chamber 140 . For example, Block S 152 can interface with the temperature sensor 131 (e.g., a thermistor) and implement closed-loop feedback to control the heating element to heat and maintain water in the boiler 130 at the target temperature. However, Block S 152 can function in any other way to control a temperature of water in the boiler 130 within the coffee brewing machine 100 . This variation of first method S 100 also includes Block S 154 , which recites metering a volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 . Generally, Block S 154 functions to displace a set volume of heated water—such as specified in the recipe or calculated in Block S 142 —into the brew chamber 140 by controlling one or more pumps and/or valves within the coffee brewing machine 100 . In one implementation, Block S 154 triggers a valve 132 between the boiler 130 and ambient air to close and powers an electromechanical pump for a particular period of time to pump air into the boiler 130 , thereby displacing heated water from the boiler 130 in to the brew chamber 140 . In this implementation, Block S 154 can calculate the particular period of time from the target volume of water for dispensation into the brew chamber 140 such that the volume of heated water dispensed into the brew chamber 140 can be controlled and achieved without a flow sensor arranged between the boiler 130 and the brew chamber 140 . In a similar implementation, the boiler 130 can be arranged at a height over the brew chamber 140 , and Block S 154 can trigger a valve 132 between the boiler 130 and the brew chamber 140 to open for a particular period of time (similarly calculated) to dispense a particular volume of heated water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 (also without interfacing with a flow sensor arranged therebetween). Alternatively, Block S 154 can interface with a flow sensor and the pump 150 within the coffee brewing machine 100 to monitor a volume of heated water dispensed into the brew chamber 140 and to control the pump accordingly. However, Block S 154 can control any other actuator within the coffee brewing machine 100 to portion a particular volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 in any other suitable way. In this variation, first method S 100 further includes Block S 160 , which recites heating the brew chamber 140 to maintain the volume of water near the target temperature. Generally, Block S 154 dispenses the volume of heated water into the brew chamber 140 , Block S 160 functions to control a heating element coupled to the brew chamber 140 —based on an output of a temperature sensor 141 also coupled to the brew chamber 140 —to maintain the temperature of the water and coffee grounds (i.e., the brew mixture) at the brew temperature. For example, Block S 160 can implement closed-loop (e.g., proportional-integral-derivative, or PID) feedback to hold the temperature of the brew mixture at the target brew temperature. Block S 160 can also function to preheat the brew chamber 140 to the target temperature before Block 154 dispenses (any) heated water into the brew chamber 140 . In particular, Block S 160 can implement closed loop feedback to power the heating element according to the target temperature and to an output of the temperature sensor 141 coupled to the brew chamber 140 , thereby heating the brew chamber 140 up to a temperature substantially identical to the temperature of heated water in the boiler 130 . Thus, when Block S 154 meters heated water from the boiler into the brew chamber 140 , the temperature of the water and the temperature of the brew chamber can be substantially similar such that the temperature of the water—now exposed to the coffee grounds—does not shift substantially from the target brew temperature. Block S 160 can preheat the brew chamber to substantially ensure that the grounds dispensed into the brew chamber are exposed to the heated water dispensed into the brew chamber 140 in Block S 154 only at the (or within a threshold range of) the target brew temperature. Block S 154 can thus delay dispensation of heated water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 until the temperature sensor 141 indicates that the brew chamber 140 can reached the target brew temperature and/or has leveled off at a temperature within a threshold range of the target brew temperature, such as within 0.5° C. of the target brew temperature for ten seconds. Block S 160 can further control the heating element to adjust the temperature of the brew mixture during the brew cycle according to a time-dependent temperature profile. For example, Block S 152 can preheat water in the boiler 130 to an initial brew temperature, and Block S 160 can control the heating element in the brew chamber 140 to hold the brew mixture at the initial temperature for a first period of time, then ramp the temperature of the brew mixture up to a second temperature at a particular rate (i.e., change in temperature per unit time), and finally hold the brew mixture at the second temperature before dispensation of the fluid from the brew chamber 140 . However, Block S 160 can control the heating element coupled to the brew chamber 140 to implement any other time-dependent brew temperature profile specified in the recipe set in Block S 142 (or Block S 140 ). Block S 160 can also record temperature data of the brew mixture and/or the brew chamber 140 during the brew cycle. For example, Block S 160 can survey the temperature sensor 141 within the brew chamber 140 at a preset rate (e.g., 10 Hz) during the brew cycle and store measured temperatures locally in memory within the coffee brewing machine 100 , such as with a tag or coffee source identifier identifying the brew cycle number and/or the coffee bean. Block S 160 can additionally or alternatively upload the set of temperatures—with the coffee source identifier—to a remote database of brew data, such as in real-time or asynchronously (e.g., upon completion of the brew cycle). Block S 152 can similarly track temperatures of water within the boiler 130 and store the data locally on the coffee brewing machine 100 and/or upload these data to the remote database, and these boiler 130 and brew chamber 140 temperature data can be analyzed locally or remotely to diagnose, troubleshoot, or preempt problems with operation of the coffee brewing machine 100 . However, Block S 160 can function in any other way to manage the temperature of the brew mixture within the brew chamber 140 during the brew cycle. This variation of first method S 100 also includes Block S 170 , which recites displaying an agitation instruction at a first time during the brew cycle according to the recipe, and Block S 172 , which recites triggering a first alarm to cease agitation at a second time during the brew cycle according to the recipe. Generally, in this variation, Block S 170 functions to prompt a user to agitate the brew mixture and Block S 172 functions to prompt the user to cease agitation based on an agitation schedule specified in the recipe. For example, Block S 154 can trigger a brew cycle timer (e.g., a countdown or a count-up timer) once Block S 154 begins to dispense water into the brew chamber 140 or once Block S 154 finishes dispensing the complete volume of water in to the brew chamber 140 , and first method S 100 can maintain and render the timer on the display 112 . In this example, Block S 170 can prompt a user to manually stir contents of the brewing chamber at a particular time during the brew cycle as specified by the recipe, and Block S 172 can control an audio driver 114 (e.g., a speaker) within the coffee brewing machine 100 to sound an audible alarm to alert the user to cease stirring once a stirring period specified in the recipe elapses. Block S 170 can also render a textual and/or image-based (e.g., a two-color dot-matrix cartoon) instruction for a type of agitation, such as stirring in a circular motion, stirring in a lateral motion, stirring in a zigzag motion, or punching down the grounds from the surface of the brew mixture, such as defined in the recipe for the agitation period. Block S 170 can additionally or alternatively deliver an audible alarm to prompt the user to begin stirring, such as through an audio driver 114 or speaker 114 within the coffee brewing machine 100 , and Block S 172 can additionally or alternatively deliver a visual cue on the display 112 to cease agitation. Block S 172 (and other Blocks of the first method S 100 ) can also render flashes on the display or otherwise modulate an intensity of a backlight of the display to provide a visual cue for a requested manual action at the coffee brewing machine 100 . However, Block S 170 and Block S 172 can cooperate in any other way to guide a user in manually agitating contents of the brew chamber 140 —such as in a particular agitation pattern—and ceasing agitation based on an agitation schedule specified in the recipe. In this variation, first method S 100 can further include Block S 174 , which recites displaying a second agitation instruction at a fourth time during the brew cycle according to the recipe, the fourth time between the second time and the third time. Generally, Block S 174 implements functionality similar to Blocks S 170 and 172 to prompt the user to execute a second agitation schedule. For example, Blocks S 170 and S 172 can cooperate to prompt the user to stir the contents of the brew chamber 140 in a circular motion over a period of ten seconds shortly after Block S 154 dispenses the volume of heated water in to the brew chamber 140 (e.g., from 0:10 to 0:20 on the brew cycle timer), and Block S 174 can prompt the user to punch down the brew mixture for ten seconds following a fifty-second rest period (e.g., from 1:10 to 1:20 on the brew cycle timer). Block S 174 can thus deliver audible and/or visual prompts to begin and then cease a second agitation cycle over a particular period of time during the brew cycle and as defined in the recipe. However, first method S 100 can deliver audible and/or visual instructions to prompt the user to complete any other number and/or type of agitation cycles during the brew cycle. In this variation, first method S 100 further includes Block S 180 , which recites triggering a second alarm to dispense fluid from the brew chamber 140 at a third time during the brew cycle according to the recipe. Generally, Block S 180 functions to prompt the user to manually begin dispensation of fluid (i.e., brewed coffee) from the brew chamber 140 upon completion of a water-to-ground contact time specified in the recipe. For example, Block S 180 can render an textual and/or cartoon-based instruction on the display 112 and/or sound an audible alarm to prompt the user to open a manual valve 142 at a base of the coffee brewing machine 100 , thereby releasing fluid from the brew chamber 140 and into a vessel below, such as directly into a coffee mug, into a coffee pot, or into a thermos. In this example, manual actuation of the valve 142 can enable fluid to passively exit the brew chamber 140 (i.e., via gravity). However, for the coffee brewing machine 100 that also includes a manually-operated plunger 170 , such as shown in FIG. 3, Block S 180 can also prompt to open the valve 142 and to then actuate the plunger 170 into the brew chamber 140 , thereby relatively rapidly evacuating fluid from the brew chamber 140 and terminating contact between the fluid and the coffee grounds, such as specified in the recipe for the coffee bean. For example, Block S 180 can render on the display 112 a textual command to actuate the plunger 170 . Block S 180 can also interface with a linear or arcuate sensor coupled to the plunger 170 or to a pivoting plunger lever 172 , respectively, to track the position of the plunger 170 and to guide displacement of the plunger 170 during actuation by the user, such as by displaying visual indicators of a target position and an actual position of the plunger 170 and prompting the user to align the visual indicators of the target position and the actual position of the plunger 170 through manual displacement of the plunger 170 . Similarly, once substantially all fluid has passively drained from the brew chamber 140 , Block S 180 can prompt the user to actuate the plunger 170 into the brew chamber 140 to evacuate any remaining fluid therefrom. However, Block S 180 can function in any other way to prompt the user to manually release fluid from the brew chamber 140 . In this variation, Blocks of first method S 100 , such as Blocks S 170 , S 172 , and S 180 , can also interface with a local coffee grinder to adjust brew parameters for the brew cycle. For example, Block S 130 can download a grind setting and grind hours (or wear) of a local coffee grinder and estimate a profile and size distribution of grounds loaded into the brew chamber 140 for the current brew cycle, and Blocks S 170 and S 172 can implement methods similar to Block S 140 described above to adjust the first time for displaying the agitation instruction and the second time for triggering the first alarm to cease agitation, respectively, during the brew cycle according to the profile and size distribution of the coffee grounds. Block S 180 can similarly adjust the third time for triggering the second alarm based on the profile and size distribution of the coffee grounds loaded into the coffee brewing machine 100 for the brew cycle. Furthermore, Blocks S 142 , S 170 S 172 , S 174 , and/or S 180 , etc. can additionally or alternatively deliver audible and/or visual prompts for inputting brew parameters (e.g., a final brew volume) and for guiding manual realization of brew parameters (e.g., filter type, agitation, dispensing of fluid from the brew chamber 140 ) through an external electronic device in communication with the coffee brewing machine 100 . For example, the coffee brewing machine 100 can communication with a nearby mobile computing device (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet) over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth communication protocol, and Blocks S 142 , S 170 S 172 , S 174 , and S 180 can deliver audible and visual prompts to a user through a speaker 114 and the display 112 (e.g., a touchscreen), respectively, integrated into the mobile computing device. In this example, Blocks S 142 , S 170 S 172 , S 174 , and/or S 180 can also receive inputs from the user via the mobile computing device, such as through a touchscreen integrated into the mobile computing device. However, Blocks of first method S 100 can interface with any other actuator (e.g., display, speaker) within or outside the coffee brewing machine 100 to communicate data to the user and to receive inputs from the user. In this variation, first method S 100 can further prepare the coffee brewing machine 100 for a subsequent brew cycle with the same coffee bean (e.g., with coffee beans from the same roast batch and/or from the same roaster) or with a different coffee bean (e.g., with coffee beans from a different roast batch and/or from a different roaster). In this implementation, first method S 100 can include Block S 190 , which recites refilling the boiler 130 . For example, Block S 190 can control a valve 132 and/or the pump 150 —similar to Block S 154 described above—to transfer water from the reservoir 120 (i.e., a holding tank) into the boiler 130 to return the water level in the boiler 130 to a particular level following dispensation of heated water from the boiler 130 in Block S 154 . Blocks of first method S 100 can then repeat to brew a second volume (e.g., a cup, a pot) of coffee. In one example in which first method S 100 brews a second cup of coffee from a different coffee bean, Block S 110 can receive a second coffee source identifier, Block S 120 can retrieve a second recipe for a second coffee bean based on the second coffee source identifier, and Block S 142 can initiate a second brew cycle through techniques similar to those described above. Block S 152 can then heat water in the boiler 130 to a second target temperature according to the second recipe, Block S 154 can meter a second volume of water from the boiler 130 into the brew chamber 140 , and Block S 160 can heat the brew chamber 140 to maintain the second volume of water near the second target temperature. Finally, Block S 170 can display a second agitation instruction at a first time during the second brew cycle according to the second recipe, Block S 172 can trigger a first alarm to cease agitation at a second time during the second brew cycle according to the second recipe, and Block S 180 can trigger a second alarm to dispense fluid from the brew chamber 140 at a third time during the second brew cycle according to the second recipe. Blocks of first method S 100 can thus repeat to brew sequential volumes of coffee from the same or different coffee beans based on preset recipes corresponding to coffee beans selected for each brew cycle. However, in this variation, Blocks of first method S 100 can function in any other way to semi-automatically implement parameters specified in a recipe for a particular coffee bean selected for brewing on a coffee brewing machine. 8. Second Method and Applications As shown in FIG. 4, a method for transmitting brewing recipes to coffee brewing machines includes: collecting a coffee source identifier corresponding to a coffee roast batch in Block S 210 ; loading a set of brew parameters assigned to the coffee roast batch in Block S 220 , the set of brew parameters including a brew temperature and a steep time; identifying a particular coffee brewing machine in a set of coffee brewing machines in Block S 230 , the particular coffee brewing machine designated to brew coffee from the coffee roast batch; and transmitting the set of brew parameters with the coffee source identifier to the coffee brewing machine 100 over a computer network in Block S 240 , the set of brew parameters defining a recipe for brewing coffee from the coffee roast batch at the coffee brewing machine 100 . Generally, second method S 200 functions to push a recipe for brewing a volume of coffee with a particular coffee bean from an entity associated with roasting the particular coffee bean to a particular coffee brewing machine designated to brew coffee with the particular coffee bean. The particular coffee brewing machine can then execute the first method described above to implement the recipe thus received. For example, once a coffee roaster roasts a batch of coffee beans, the coffee roaster can define, refine, or tweak a brew recipe specific to the roast batch, such as a brew temperature, a steep time (i.e., brew duration), an agitation schedule, a grind profile or grind size, and/or a coffee ground-to-water ratio, etc. In this example, the roaster can brew test cups of coffee on a “master” coffee brewing machine, which can record brewing parameters selected or implemented by the roaster during the test tests, and the roaster can select a preferred or favorite test cup. The master coffee brewing machine can then execute Block S 220 of second method S 200 to generate a recipe for the particular coffee bean based on the set of parameters recorded for the selected test cup, execute Block S 230 to identify coffee brewing machines affiliated with the roaster (e.g., coffee brewing machines in coffee shops that serve coffee beans from the roaster), and execute Block S 240 of second method S 200 to push (i.e., automatically transmit) the recipe to the identified coffee brewing machine(s) with an identifier of the corresponding coffee bean. Thus, a coffee brewing machine that received the recipe can execute the first method described above to implement the recipe when the corresponding coffee bean is scanned or selected for a subsequent brew cycle at the coffee brewing machine 100 . Blocks of second method S 200 can thus be implemented on coffee brewing machine, such as the coffee brewing machine 100 described above and shown in FIG. 3 or a master coffee brewing machine as described above. Blocks of second method S 200 can additionally or alternatively be implemented on a remote computer system, such as a computer network or a remote server. Block S 210 of second method S 200 recites collecting a coffee source identifier corresponding to a coffee roast batch. Generally, Block S 210 of second method S 200 functions to receive an identifier for the present coffee bean and to pair this identifier with the recipe specific to the coffee bean and generated in Block S 220 . Block S 210 can therefore implement methods or techniques similar to those of Block S 110 described above to collect the coffee source identifier. For example, Block S 210 can receive an optical scan of a bar code, a QR code, a serial number, or any other symbol printed or arranged on a package containing or designated to contain the coffee bean, and Block S 210 can pair this identifier with the recipe generated in Block S 220 . In another example, Block S 210 can receive a batch number, a serial number (e.g., a unique ID) or an other alphanumeric sequence scanned from an RFID tag arranged on or designated for a package containing the coffee bean, and Block S 210 can pair this alphanumeric sequence with the recipe generated in Block S 220 . However, Block S 210 can collect an identifier of the coffee bean in any other form and in any other way and pair this identifier with a particular batch, roast, or group of coffee beans. Block S 220 of second method S 200 recites loading a set of brew parameters assigned to the coffee roast batch, the set of brew parameters including a brew temperature and a steep time. Generally, Block S 220 functions to collect brew parameters selected by the roaster for the coffee bean (e.g., the roast or roast batch of coffee beans) and to aggregate these brew parameters into a recipe for the coffee bean. In one implementation, Block S 220 records brew parameters previously applied at a “master” coffee brewing machine during a test brew cycle for the coffee bean. For example, Block S 220 can collect a brew temperature and a steep time applied at the master coffee brewing machine during a previous test brew cycle, the previous test brew cycle selected by the roaster as the preferred or favorite test cup for the coffee bean. Block S 220 can also collect data corresponding to manual inputs supplied by the roaster during the selected test brew cycle and incorporated these manual inputs into the recipe. For example, Block S 220 can record a first time during the selected test brew cycle at which the roaster begins agitation of fluid within a brew chamber 140 of the master coffee brewing machine, a second time at which the roaster ceases agitation of the fluid, and a steep time corresponding to an elapsed time between initiation of the text brew cycle and dispensation of fluid from the brew chamber 140 of the master coffee brewing machine. Block S 220 can thus automatically define agitation start and stop times and steep time in the recipe for the coffee based on these manual inputs recorded at the master coffee brewing machine during the test brew cycle corresponding to the selected test cup of coffee brewed with the coffee bean. Block S 220 can additionally or alternatively prompt the roaster to manually enter specific agitation instructions for detected agitations periods during the selected test brew cycle, and Block S 220 can incorporate these data into the recipe accordingly. Alternatively, Block S 210 can prompt manual selection or entry of the coffee source identifier, Block S 220 can prompt manual selection or entry of brew parameters for the coffee bean, and Blocks S 210 and S 220 can cooperate to generate the recipe associated with the coffee source identifier and defining the selected or entered brew parameters. In one example, Block S 210 can prompt the roaster to enter a batch number of the coffee bean or to select a sequence of coffee source identifiers of coffee bags allocated for the coffee bean. In another example, Block S 220 can prompt the roaster to manually enter agitation data for the coffee bean, such as agitation type, agitation start time, and/or agitation duration for one or more agitation periods for a brew cycle with the coffee bean. In this example, Block S 220 can also prompt the roaster to enter a total time for the brew cycle, a volume of water to dispense into the brew chamber 140 , and/or any other parameter for a brew cycle specific to the coffee bean, and Block S 220 can generate the recipe for the coffee bean (e.g., for the roast batch, for the roaster, etc.) accordingly. Block S 230 of second method S 200 recites identifying a particular coffee brewing machine in a set of coffee brewing machines, the particular coffee brewing machine designated to brew coffee from the coffee roast batch. Generally, Block 230 functions to automatically populate a list of coffee brewing machines to which to push the recipe for the coffee bean, the selected coffee brewing machines likely or possibly to brew the coffee bean in the future. In particular, Block S 230 identifies coffee brewing machines operated by the roaster and/or operated by entities affiliated with roaster (e.g., by contract) and therefore designated as coffee brewing machines that may brew coffee beans roasted and supplied by the roaster. In one implementation, Block S 230 accesses a list of coffee brewing machines associated with one or more cafés or shops designated to receive the roast batch. For example, the roaster can roast a single batch of coffee designated for a single coffee shop, and Block S 230 can access an order form for the roast batch (such as stored locally on the master coffee brewing machine), identify the designated coffee shop for the order from the order form, and retrieve a list of coffee brewing machine operated by the designated coffee shop, such as from a remote server or database containing location and/or shop affiliation data for each coffee brewing machine configured to execute the first method. In another example, Block S 230 can retrieve a list of all coffee brewing machines operated by coffee shops affiliated with the coffee roasters, such as stored locally on the master coffee brewing machine or remotely on a database owned by the roaster. Block S 230 can collect a list of one or more unique addresses, each address affiliated with a unique coffee brewing machine. For example, Block S 230 can collect an Internet Protocol (IP) address or an email address assigned to each identified coffee brewing machine. However, Block S 230 can identify affiliated coffee brewing machines and populate a list of any other suitable type of addresses for the identified coffee brewing machines in any other suitable way. Block S 240 of second method S 200 recites transmitting the set of brew parameters with the coffee source identifier to the coffee brewing machine 100 over a computer network, the set of brew parameters defining a recipe for brewing coffee from the coffee roast batch at the coffee brewing machine 100 . Generally, Block S 240 functions to push automatically the recipe generated in Block S 220 —tagged with the coffee source identifier collected in Block S 210 —to one or more coffee brewing machines identified in Block S 230 such that these coffee brewing machines are already loaded with the recipe specific to the coffee bean when brewing cycles with the coffee bean are later initiated at the coffee brewing machine 100 s . For example, Block S 240 can upload the recipe, the coffee source identifier, and the list of addresses for the identified coffee brewing machines to a computer network, such as over Wi-Fi, cellular, or Ethernet communication, and the computer network can distribute the recipe and the coffee source identifier to the specified coffee brewing machine 100 s. In one implementation, Block S 240 transmits the recipe and the coffee source identifier for a new coffee bean—such as a new type of coffee bean or a new roast batch of the same type of coffee bean now available from the roaster and/or designated for a particular café, coffee shop, or coffee brewing machine, etc.—to the identified coffee brewing machines. In this implementation, the recipe thus defines a new recipe specifying a set of brew parameters for a new type, batch, or source, etc. of coffee bean. In another implementation, Block S 240 transmits the recipe and the coffee source identifier for an existing coffee bean corresponding to an earlier recipe previously loaded onto one or more coffee brewing machines, such as for an existing type of coffee bean supplied by the roaster or a previous roast type or roach batch provided by the roaster. Thus, in this implementation, Block S 240 can distribute the recipe to one or more coffee brewing machines to override a previous recipe (i.e., a previous set of brew parameters) associated with the coffee source identifier and stored in memory on the coffee brewing machine 100 s. However, Blocks S 210 , S 220 , S 230 , and S 240 of second method S 200 can cooperate in any other way to generate a new recipe for a new coffee source identifier and/or to update an existing recipe for a current coffee source identifier and to distribute (i.e., push) the new and/or updated recipe to associated coffee brewing machines. The methods and coffee brewing machine of the invention can be embodied and/or implemented at least in part as a machine configured to receive a computer-readable medium storing computer-readable instructions. The instructions can be executed by computer-executable components integrated with an application, applet, host, server, network, website, communication service, communication interface, hardware/firmware/software elements of a user computer or mobile device, or any suitable combination thereof.

No. 12/247,231, filed Oct. 8, 2008, which is assigned to the same assignee as the subject patent application and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The disclosures herein relate generally to the preparation of beverages for consumption, and more particularly, to brewing beverages such as coffee. BACKGROUND Quality standards in the specialty coffee industry established during the 1950's and 1960's that coffee extraction of approximately 20% (usually a range of ˜18-22%) will achieve the best quality brewed coffee, using various brew methods. Over the ensuing years these established standards have been generally referred to as the gold-cup standard, and have been accepted internationally by many institutions, educational establishments, and standards committees. The precise extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration) may be varied for particular coffees, to achieve finely tuned recipes for particular coffee cultivars, climates and growing regions, also known as terroir, and other characteristics. Extraction (solubles yield) refers to the percentage of the dry coffee by weight that is removed by dissolving in water during the brewing process. Up to 30% of the available soluble solids in ground coffee can be extracted, with most of the remaining 70% being cellulose, and not soluble in water. However, generally speaking, extracting more than 22% will begin to sharply increase those components in coffee that contribute to the bitter taste defects associated with over-extraction. Extracting less than 18% is generally associated with weak, under-developed taste defects. The finished brew is a balance between extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration). Over-extracting results in the extraction of many of the bitter components of the remaining solids. These contribute significantly to those taste defects known as bitter, strong-bitter and weak bitter. Under-extracting causes a taste defect that is under-developed and can be weakly or strongly under-developed. As coffee dissolves, the bulk of the solids including the sweeter components dissolve during the first 30-50% of the brewing cycle, and the more bitter elements start to dissolve in the latter half of the brewing cycle. The highest quality coffee will have rich aroma, fullness of body, delicacy of flavor as well as clarity and unique character—all optimally balanced. Achieving these attributes requires a significant degree of precision during the coffee brewing process. Strength (solubles concentration) refers to the measured amount of solids extracted into the final coffee solution. Strength may be expressed as the percentage total dissolved solids (% TDS). For example, for 100 grams of a coffee measuring 1.3% TDS, there are 98.7 grams of water, and 1.3 grams of dissolved coffee solids in solution. Refractive index measurements have been used for process control in the food industry since the 1940s. Typical measurements are usually for sugars in fruits such as melons, for orange and other juices, for sugar content in grapes for the wine industry, and many other examples. SUMMARY Accordingly, in one embodiment a method of determining the total dissolved solids (TDS) in brewed coffee is disclosed. The method includes providing a brewed coffee sample to a coffee refractometer. The method also includes determining, by the coffee refractometer, the index of refraction (n s ) of the brewed coffee sample. The method further includes determining, by the coffee refractometer, the temperature of the brewed coffee sample to provide temperature compensation to the coffee refractometer. The method still further includes accessing, by a processor in the refractometer, a memory store in the refractometer, the memory store including a TDS formula that expresses the TDS of brewed coffee as a function of the index of refraction (n s ) of brewed coffee and the temperature of brewed coffee, to determine the resultant TDS of the brewed coffee sample. In another embodiment, a coffee refractometer is disclosed. The coffee refractometer includes a prism for receiving a brewed coffee sample thereon to form a prism-sample interface. The coffee refractometer also includes a processor that controls a light source to provide incident light to the prism-sample interface, the prism-sample interface refracting light toward a photodetector that couples to the processor. The coffee refractometer further include a temperature sensor, situated adjacent the prism-sample interface and coupled to the processor, that provides temperature information to the processor. The coffee refractometer still further includes a memory store, accessible by the processor, that stores a TDS formula that expresses the TDS of brewed coffee as a function of the index of refraction (n s ) of brewed coffee and the temperature of brewed coffee, to determine the resultant TDS of the brewed coffee sample. In one embodiment, the TDS formula expresses TDS as a linear function of index of refraction (n s ) of the brewed coffee sample and a quadratic function of the temperature of the brewed coffee sample. In another embodiment, the TDS formula expresses TDS as a quadratic function of index of refraction (n s ) of the brewed coffee sample and a quadratic function of the temperature of the brewed coffee sample.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a prior original brewing chart that shows soluble solids vs. brew formula as a function of extraction percent, namely 5-40 percent as seen in the upper left of the chart (CBC Publication No. 27, 1969, p12.). The y axis represents soluble solids concentration (strength) in percent while the x axis represents the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. Hyperbolic curves representing soluble solids yield extraction in percent from 5-40% are illustrated. Of particular interest in this series of hyperbolas are region of interest 105 and the smaller region of interest 110 . Region of interest 105 relates to a study carried out by the Brewing Committee of the National Coffee Association, which judged brews prepared within this region for objective acceptability. The Midwest Research Institute carried out a more recent independent study from which it was concluded that the most acceptable coffee would result from preparation within the more refined region of interest 110 , for soluble solids concentration (strength) from 1.15 to 1.35 percent and soluble solids yield extraction between 18 and 22 percent (Niven, W. W., Jr. and Shaw, B. C., Critical Conditions for Quality Coffee Brewing, Coffee and Tea Industries 80, No. 4, 44, April. 1957. Tea and Coffee Trade Journal, 112, No. 4, 28-April. 1957. Coffee Brewing Center, Nos. 19 and 27, 1969. The brewing chart of FIG. 1 signifies that a very small area of the curves thereof (i.e. region of interest 105 or region of interest 110 ) should be targeted for proper coffee extraction relative to the wide range of extraction possible. FIG. 2 is an enlargement of a portion of the brewing chart of FIG. 1 focusing on regions of interest 105 and 110 . FIG. 3 is a conventional representation of the data for FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 including solubles concentration (strength) vs. solubles yield (extraction) with brew formula as the parameter. More particularly, the y axis of FIG. 3 represents extracted solids in solution (percent TDS or total dissolved solids) while the x axis represents extraction in ounces per pound (solubles yield). The plotted curves are nearly straight lines (curves) that correspond to the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. The plot of FIG. 3 identifies a substantially centered rectangular region of interest 305 as representing the ideal coffee brew. This region of interest 305 is the same as originally published by the CBC and as identified as developed by the Midwest Research Institute, region 110 , previously in FIGS. 1 and 2. These plots assume the specific gravity of water at ambient temperature which may in fact be substantially different from the specific gravity of water at the actual brewing temperature. This assumption may have a negative impact on the brewing process and may affect the ability to reach a particular target percent of TDS of coffee in solution and a particular percent extraction if the ratio of coffee to water is determined at an incorrect temperature. Since the density of water changes as a function of temperature, the volume of water to weight of coffee ratios are affected accordingly. To further illustrate this problem, commercial brewer-extractors are typically preset to approximately 200 degrees F. and volume is calibrated at the boiler set point, whereas a home brewer typically uses water at tap or room temperature, i.e. an ambient temperature of approximately 50-65 degrees F. The volume of a given weight of water at room temperature will be significantly less than the volume of the same weight of water at 200 degrees F., because water is more dense at ambient than at 200 degrees. This scenario can lead to inaccurate brewing results when using the coffee brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIG. 4A is substantially the same coffee control brewing chart of FIG. 3 except that the x axis is now expressed in percent extraction, a more convenient unitless method of expression, instead of ounces extracted per pound of coffee. For example, if 3.2 ounces of coffee are extracted from 16 ounces of coffee, this corresponds to 20% extraction by weight. While the parameters of the x axis and y axis are expressed in percent, the brew formula of FIG. 4A remains in units of gallons of water per pound of coffee, as was the case in the brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIGS. 4 B- 4 E show a similar conventional representation of the typical brewing chart in common use today. For each brew batch size and unit of measure, separate conventional representations are needed, where such representations show separate brew formulas each labelled for the weight of ground coffee called for in that dedicated batch size. FIGS. 4B-4E show separate charts required for each separate batch size, and units of measure used, including gallons of brew water per ounce of ground coffee, similarly half-gallons per ounce, liters per gram and quarts per ounce. Expressed alternatively, FIG. 4B is a conventional brewing chart for grams coffee per liter water. FIG. 4C is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 gallon water. FIG. 4D is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per half gallon water. FIG. 4E is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 quart water. FIG. 5 shows the universal coffee brewing chart that the disclosed coffee design software application may generate. Rectangle 505 denotes a region of interest of acceptable strength in percent total dissolved solids (% TDS or solubles concentration) and extraction percent (solubles yield) that are found to be very desirable for the experienced palate, typically from approx. 1.2% to approx. 1.4% strength and approx. 19% to approx. 21% extraction, more typically from approx. 1.15% to approx. 1.55% strength and approx. 18% to approx. 22% extraction. Such regions of interest may be defined specifically as being best suited for particular coffee cultivars, regions, roast styles, and terroir, and may be developed specifically as preferences or suggested recipes for brewing particular coffees, and may be further developed as a result of consumer taste profiles and overlaid as new regions of interest to suit a particular consumer preference, roaster preference or user preference. For example, consumer preferences may be plotted on an additional z-scale, and consider an n-point scale (from “like intensely” to “dislike intensely”) which is plotted as a three-dimensional surface chart, where the y-scale is solubles concentration (%) and the X-scale is solubles yield (%). The surface chart may then be resolved to a colorized two-dimensional chart by viewing the three-dimensional chart from the top, and plotting the z-axis (consumer preference) in colors and in two dimensions, along with the traditional solubles yield (percent extraction) and solubles concentration (percent TDS, strength) superimposed on the same two-dimensional chart. Such a representation may provide an update to the most recent “optimum balance” regions of interest, and as corrected for brew water temperature. Brew formula line 510 represents the brew formula of water and coffee and makes the brew formula a dimensionless unit of measure by stating brew formula as a ratio (e.g. 17.19) of water to coffee by weight. This ratio remains constant despite variations in size of coffee batches brewed or the units used, thereby eliminating a requisite of separate brewing control charts for each different unit of measure or changes in batch size, as required in the past with conventional brewing control charts. Unfortunately, the conventional brewing control charts of FIGS. 1-3, 4 A- 4 E are not flexible because a different brewing control chart is needed each time brewing batch size or units of measure changes. Moreover in these conventional charts, mixed units of volume of water are used with weight measurement units of coffee, mandating a new chart whenever a unit of measure or batch size changed. However, in one embodiment, the disclosed coffee design application and system is capable of generating a universal coffee brewing control chart that is stepless in portion sizes and continuous as coffee batch size, brew formulas, extraction and strength changes and as other variables change. The universal coffee brewing control chart also manages variable and mixed units, for example, brew water may be specified in gallons and coffee weight in grams, or water in liters and coffee weight in ounces. The disclosed coffee design application converts water volume at the temperature specified to weight to plot the correct brew formula ratio. Previous original brewing charts assumed water at room temperature, and conventional charts assumed water at 140 degrees F. as corrected for the hydrometer instrument used. However, the disclosed coffee design application corrects for the actual brew water temperature. The disclosed coffee design application will replot the control chart steplessly and in real time as the user changes design inputs. For example, as brew strength increases, brew formula line 505 may be continuously replotted to the left and higher in FIG. 5. Likewise, as brew strength decreases, brew formula line 505 may shift continuously to the right and lower in FIG. 5. With each change in the brew formula line, all other design output parameters are calculated and displayed continuously and in real time, and portions are determined based on actual start and brew water temperatures to maintain portions true to the brew formula ratio, eliminating previous errors in the range of 2-4%. With the universal coffee brew control chart that this application provides, there is no need for a series of different brew control charts for each batch size or units of measure. The following EQUATION 1 determines Percent Extraction using the Brew Formula Ratio, Water Density at Brew Temp and Percent TDS as variables. More particularly, from TDS %=0 to TDS %=10, the disclosed coffee design application determines Extraction for each TDS point using EQUATION 1: EXTRACTION %=( BF Ratio−water density_(g/ml @ brew Temp)* waterLost_ml/g_coffee)/(1 /TDS %−0.01))  Equation 1 To calculate Extraction % using this equation, Brew Formula Ratio (BF Ratio) should first be determined from the user input using the Strength Slider (TDS %) setting and the Target Extraction %. If the user changes the Strength Slider, then the BF Ratio changes and the brew formula line moves to a new location on the brew chart. Water density at brew temperature and water lost per gram are constants. Equation 1 is not a linear equation. The disclosed coffee design application plots the resulting point pairs on the control chart of FIG. 5 to draw the brew formula line 510 . The brew formula line 510 is drawn from generated data point pairs by incrementing Percent TDS from 0 to 10 and calculating Percent Extraction. The universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction, namely change in TDS over change in extraction. The Brew Formula is used to calculate these point pairs. As will be explained in more detail below, the disclosed coffee design application will plot the intended coffee design as a small circle 515 (red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . Subsequently, after brewing a sample batch of coffee according to the specified design parameters and measuring the total dissolved (TDS %) with the disclosed coffee refractometer, the disclosed coffee application will plot the actual measured coffee design as a large circle 520 (blue plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . FIG. 6A shows an information handling system 600 on which the coffee design application may execute as a computer program product. More particularly, FIG. 6 shows an information handling system (IHS) 600 that includes coffee design application 602 and an operating system 606 . IHS 600 may initially store coffee design application 602 as a computer program product on a medium 608 , such as a CD, DVD or other medium. In this particular embodiment, IHS 600 includes a processor 610 having multiple compute elements (CEs) on a common semiconductor die 612 . IHS 600 processes, transfers, communicates, modifies, stores or otherwise handles information in digital form, analog form or other form. IHS 600 includes a bus 615 that couples processor 610 to system memory 620 via a memory controller 625 and memory bus 630 . A video graphics controller 635 couples display 640 to bus 615 . Nonvolatile storage 645 , such as a hard disk drive, CD drive, DVD drive, or other nonvolatile storage couples to bus 615 to provide IHS 600 with permanent storage of information. Operating system 606 loads in memory 620 to govern the operation of IHS 600 . I/O devices 650 , such as a keyboard and a mouse pointing device, couple to bus 615 via I/O controller 655 and I/O bus 660 . One or more expansion busses 665 , such as USB, IEEE 1394 bus, ATA, SATA, PCI, PCIE and other busses, couple to bus 615 to facilitate the connection of peripherals and devices to IHS 600 . A network interface adapter 670 couples to bus 615 to enable IHS 600 to connect by wire or wirelessly to a network and other information handling systems. While FIG. 6A shows one IHS that employs processor 610 , the IHS may take many forms. For example, IHS 600 may take the form of a desktop, server, portable, laptop, notebook, or other form factor computer or data processing system. IHS 600 may take other form factors such as a gaming device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld computing device, a portable telephone device, a communication device or other devices that include a processor and memory. A user of IHS 600 loads medium 608 into IHS 600 to store coffee design application 602 on non-volatile storage 645 as coffee design application 602 ′. When IHS 600 initializes, the IHS loads operating system 606 into system memory 620 for execution as operating system 606 ′. The IHS also loads coffee design application 602 ′ into system memory 620 for execution as coffee design application 602 ″. FIG. 6B shows a hand-held information handling system 675 that exhibits a small form factor such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). For example, IHS 675 may be a portable telephone type device or hand-held computer, such as an IHS that executes Microsoft Windows CE, or a Palm Pilot type device or an iPhone type IHS or smart phone. (PalmPilot is a trademark of Palm, Inc. iPhone is a trademark of Apple Inc.) In this embodiment, coffee design application 602 is embedded within the small form factor IHS as shown in FIG. 6B. In more detail, hand-held IHS 675 includes a microcontroller 676 that includes an internal memory 677 and firmware 678 . IHS 675 includes a non-volatile memory 679 coupled to microcontroller 676 . In one embodiment, non-volatile memory 679 stores coffee design application 602 therein as shown. In another embodiment, firmware 678 may contain coffee design application 602 or memory 677 may contain coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 includes a sensor package 680 that includes an accelerometer sensor 681 , a proximity sensor 682 , a touch sensor 683 and a photo sensor 684 . Sensor package 680 couples to microcontroller 676 . IHS 675 further includes an RF communication package 685 that includes a 3G/GPRS/GSM phone communication module 686 , and EDGE phone communication module 687 , an IEEE 802.11 network communication module 688 and a Bluetooth local communication module 689 . RF communication package 686 couples to microcontroller 676 . Both a touch sensitive display 690 and a camera 691 couple to microcontroller 676 as shown. A global positioning system (GPS) module 692 also couples to microcontroller 676 to provide position information thereto. In one embodiment, sensor package 680 generates a first position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a first spatial position or orientation such as a horizontal position, for example, with respect to a particular reference point. Sensor package 680 generates a second position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a second spatial position or orientation such as a vertical position with respect to the particular reference point. IHS 675 is configured to send the first and second position signals to coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 is further configured such that coffee design application receives user input from touch screen display 690 when sensor package 680 generates the first position signal indicating that the IHS 675 is in the first position. Coffee design application 602 responds to the first position signal and accepts user input when it receives the first position signal. For example, such user input may include user input preferences to set modes and temperatures, and user input commands to accept % TDS strength and other input variables using a combination of touch screen commands, buttons and text or number entry modes. When coffee design application 602 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second position, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response computes and plots the solution and charts results of the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula curve, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . In other words, the user holds IHS 676 horizontally while inputting information and flips the IHS 675 to a vertical position to command that IHS 675 draw a universal brewing control chart on the display 690 . It is noted that the first and second positions are described as being horizontal and vertical, respectively, for purposes of example. The disclosed IHS applies as well to other first and second positions or spatial orientations without departing from the spirit of the invention. FIGS. 7A-7B show depicts a textual representation of the disclosed coffee design process including 1) setting user preferences at set preferences block 705 , 2) conducting the design protocol at design protocol block 710 , 3) performing a total dissolved solids (TDS) measurement with a refractometer at TDS measurement block 715 , 4) correcting the brew protocol if necessary (included in block 715 ), 4) saving data at block 720 , and 5) printing data at block 725 . The process also includes providing help information at block 730 . The processor further includes an “about the program” block 730 with design credits, legal notices and license key information. FIGS. 7A-7B show provides a high level overview of the coffee design process. The screen shots of FIG. 8A-8J will provide more detail with respect to the coffee design process and are discussed below following discussion of the FIGS. 7A-7B high level process. The user sets preferences in set preferences block 705 . More particularly, the user may select one of three different coffee design modes as a starting preference, namely: Start By Entering 1) brewing water volume 2) desired coffee yield or 3) ground coffee weight. In brewing water volume design mode, the user inputs starting brewing water volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS as input values. In response, coffee design application 602 determines or computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely ground coffee weight and resulting coffee yield volume. In desired coffee yield mode, the user inputs the desired coffee yield in volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight. In ground coffee weight mode, the user inputs the ground coffee weight and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume. In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may select the starting water temperature. In one embodiment, the default starting water temperature is 55 degrees F. However, a user may select a starting water temperature between 55 and 70 degrees F. if the user is using a home brewer with bottled or tap water. The user may also select a brewing temperature in block 705 . The default brewing temperature is 201 degrees F. in one embodiment. The user may select a brewing temperature that is typically between 190 and 205 degrees F. The user may also specify temperature units in degrees F. or degrees C. in block 705 . In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may also select target settings for the coffee brewing process. For example, the user may input a coffee target extraction (solubles yield). The default coffee target coffee extraction is 20%, but for some coffees, a user may want to target a lower value, such as 19.5%, to emphasize sweetness, or sugars content, typical of high elevation grown coffees, for example. For other coffees that lack certain types of acidic components, one may want to select a higher target extraction, such as 22%, for example, since higher solubles yield (extraction) of that particular coffee will not extract bitter components. The user may also specify an iced coffee target extraction for which the default is 19%, to emphasize sweetness. The user may also specify a finished iced coffee target TDS strength for which the default is 2% after dilution and brewing over ice. The user may also specify and input brew chart preferences such as enabling pan and zoom on the universal brewing chart (discussed below), turning on and off taste defect labels and turning on and off region labels, as well as specifying custom regions of interest by particular coffees and or consumer preference regions. In a special case, ICED Coffee final strength target is set by the user as a preference to provide the coffee design application an input for calculation of 97% ice melt (and dilution) of concentrate which starts at a concentration strength TDS of 3.8%, and ending up at 2.0% after dilution (ICE melt). In the design protocol block 710 of the process flow of FIGS. 7A-7B, the user may select or input desired starting value units. For example, for coffee yield the user may specify volume units such as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In another embodiment, coffee yield units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In an other embodiment, brew water units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may then enter input value in the units selected in the previous step, as well as the desired strength in percent TDS. For example, in the case of coffee yield in volume, the user may specify the desired coffee yield as 2 liters, or 1.5 gallons. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In each mode, the % TDS is also selected as in an input value. For coffee brewing protocols, brew water and coffee yield are typically measured in volume for practical reasons, due to the ease of measurement of such bulk in volume versus weight, as long as temperature (and density) are taken into account. However, in espresso, or single-serve coffee, where volumes are typically much smaller, for example, for a single-serve portion, measurements are more practical and also more accurate when specified in weight. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may also input a selection that the start temperature is the brew temperature if desired. More particularly, the user may select a “start temperature=brew temperature” checkbox (discussed below in FIG. 8) by checking such box if using a commercial brewer with a boiler tank or may leave the checkbox unchecked if using a home brewer with tap or bottled at 50-75 degrees F. The user may also select the desired strength preference within design protocol block 710 . The user may adjust and select the desired strength preference by moving an adjust strength slider (discussed below in FIG. 8). The adjustable strength slider selects desired strength in total dissolved solids (TDS) percent. The TDS range accessible by the strength slider is based on beverage type. For hot coffee, the selectable range varies from 1.0-2.0% in one embodiment. The user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 2.00% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Alternatively, the user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 3.60% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range 2” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Extended ranges are useful for troubleshooting existing coffee brewing protocols in the field that are being evaluated to be corrected, and may not be within normal ranges, due to significant brew formula portioning errors in excess of 5-8%, for example, or excessive extraction errors, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 4%, to cover a range more appropriate for coffee concentrates, such as for iced coffee, or for hot coffee to be diluted to a desired strength preference by addition of hot water to the brewed concentrate, for a single serve beverage brewer, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 18%, to cover a range more appropriate for espresso, for example. Upon selection of the desired strength preference and the other input values and selection of units, coffee design application 602 generates a brew formula curve or line which is plotted on a universal coffee brewing chart such as shown in FIG. 5. Recall that the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction. The Brew Formula Ratio is used to calculate point pairs using Equation 1. The plotted brew formula line takes into account the volume of water as a function of temperature, and computes the correct weight of coffee required to meet the specified brewing protocol, and the resulting finished coffee yield. The target strength selected is plotted on the brew formula line as a small circle 515 (red point) and represents the targeted design parameters. The user then proceeds to brew the coffee using the design output parameters that coffee design application 602 generates. If the user selected brew water volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the resulting coffee yield volume and required ground coffee weight values corresponding to those input conditions. If the user selected desired coffee yield volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight values corresponding to that input condition. If the user selected coffee weight and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume corresponding to those input conditions. The user then employs the particular input conditions and corresponding values to actually brew a test batch of coffee. As part of the coffee design process of FIGS. 7A-7B, the user brews a sample of the targeted design batch of coffee as specified by the input conditions and corresponding determined variable values or results. The user places a sample of the test batch into the disclosed coffee refractometer (see FIG. 10 below) to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % by measuring the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Before using the refractometer, the user first calibrates the refractometer using distilled water. The refractometer and water should preferably be within the temperature range of 20 degrees-25 degrees C., in one embodiment. The user cools a 10-20 ml sample of the brewed coffee to between 20 degrees C. and 30 degrees C. The user places the cooled sample into the refractometer and allows 1-2 minutes for the sample and the refractometer to reach the same temperature. After temperature stabilization, the user takes a TDS % reading, as per bock 715 . The user then enters the TDS reading into coffee design application 602 . In response, coffee design application 602 adds a large circle plot point 520 (blue point) on the same brew formula line 510 of the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 generated during the design step. The large circle (blue point) % TDS measurement shows where the current coffee batch falls on that chart relative to the intended design point 515 (small red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield). After observing where the current coffee batch results appear on the universal coffee brewing chart, the user may take corrective action, if necessary, to ensure that the final coffee design for subsequent batches of coffee falls within the parameters of the desired region of interest. Such corrective action may include: 1) Under-Extraction: If the blue large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, below and to the left on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was under-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with under-developed flavors. Common causes of under-extraction are too coarse a grind, too short a contact time with water during the brew period, lack of pre-infusion or pre-infusion levels too low and/or time too short, water too hard (mineral content too high), brew temperature too low, and/or lack of even wetting or turbulence in the brew basket. 2) Over-Extraction: If the large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, above and to the right on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was over-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with over-extracted bitter flavors. Common causes of over-extraction are too fine a grind, too long a contact time with water during the brew period, pre-infusion levels too high and/or time too long, too much turbulence in the brew basket, water too soft (too low a mineral content), and/or brew temperature too high. FIGS. 8C, 8 E and 8 G depict screen shots of coffee design application 602 that show different startup modes that are selectable via user Startup Preferences (FIG. 8A), with input selections and corresponding outputs and universal brew formula plotted on charts 8 B, 8 D and 8 F. More particularly, the following design modes are selectable via user startup preferences: 1) brew water volume 2) desired coffee yield and 3) ground coffee weight. The user selects one of the 3 modes as starting input variables in coffee design application 602 . In response to this selection and percent TDS as inputs, coffee design application 602 determines the remaining 2 variables as outputs. For example, if the user selects brewing water volume (and selects a % TDS) as the starting variable or mode, coffee design application 602 determines a corresponding coffee yield and coffee ground weight. Alternatively, if the user selects desired coffee yield (and selects a % TDS), then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and coffee ground weight needed to achieve this desired coffee yield. This mode is a particularly useful and valuable tool for the coffee trade because it promotes better brewing practice. For example, typically, a brewer may be programmed to dispense water volume in units of gallons, for example one-half gallon. However, the user may be brewing into a commonly available 2.2 or 2.5 liter brewing thermos. Typical yield under these conditions will be approximately 1.7 liters, leaving 0.5 to 0.7 liters in the thermos empty. Coffee brewed in this manner will degrade more rapidly because it cools more quickly, and loses aromatic volatiles that evaporate and condense inside the empty portion of the thermos. Selecting this mode will automatically adjust the required brew water volume and ground coffee required to yield a full batch sized to the thermos is use. Using coffee design application 602 , any units of brew water volume, desired coffee yield and ground coffee weight may be selected to suit the actual conditions in the field. Alternatively, if the user selects coffee ground weight (at the desired % TDS strength) as a starting variable or mode, then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and resulting coffee yield. This mode is particularly useful for users of pre-ground coffee packets (pillow-packs), where the user selects a fixed coffee portion and desired percent TDS (strength) and application 602 outputs the required brew water volume and resulting yield to brew to gold-cup standards. Coffee design application 602 generates three windows that help to design and measure brewing parameters. These windows are 1) a startup preferences or brewing preferences window, 2) a main application window and a 3) universal brewing control chart. Coffee design application 602 charts parameters and provides instant feedback so that adjustments, when necessary, can be made quickly and effectively by the user. FIG. 8A shows a Startup Preferences window 801 that coffee design application 602 generates to enable the user to input operating modes and preferences. Preferences (including changes) are saved automatically between application sessions. The user starts a first design session using the Default Preferences. Upon entering startup preferences window 801 , the user selects a preferred design mode in the “Start by Entering” area 802 in the upper left corner of window 801 . The user selects one of the three buttons in the “Start by Entering” area 802 , namely 1) the Water Volume button 803 —Select this option to design by entering the Brew Water Volume amount. In this mode, the software determines or calculates the ground coffee and coffee yield amounts based on user strength TDS selected. 2) the Desired Coffee Yield (Vol) button 804 —Select this option to design by entering the Desired Coffee Yield Volume; in this mode, the coffee design application software 202 determines or calculates the ground coffee and brew water amounts based on user strength TDS selected. or 3) the Ground Coffee Weight button 805 —Select this option if you are working with a fixed weight of coffee, such as a pillow pack. In this mode, the coffee design application software 202 calculates the brew water volume and coffee yield volume amounts based on user strength TDS selected. The user may select the “Start Value=Last Used” checkbox 806 if the user desires the coffee design application 602 to remember the mode and values used in the last session upon the next startup of the application. Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Target Settings” area 807 where the user may input Hot Coffee Target Extraction % at box 808 . For standard drip brewing of coffee, this default is set to 20 percent extraction, an industry standard “starting point” applicable to a wide range of coffees. For a sweeter cup, the user may try 18.5-19.5 percent, depending on taste preferences, the particular coffee, degree of roast, and grade of grind. Note that extracting to lower targeted levels will require more coffee to achieve the same strength preference. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Extraction at box 809 . For iced coffee, the default target extraction of 19% results in a sweeter cup that is significantly less bitter than a setting of 20% would provide. With higher elevation grown coffees rich in sugars, this recipe often results in a sweet tasting batch without the use of supplemental sweeteners. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Strength at box 810 . For iced coffee, this is the final result of the concentrate after 95-97% all of the ice has melted at the end of the brew. The concentrate is ready to use immediately after the brew cycle has completed. Box 811 indicates the current strength % TDS) range selected for the available design and chart range. If the user selects normal range checkbox 811 A, then box 811 displays a strength range of 1.15-1.55%. If the user selects “Extended Range 1” checkbox 811 B, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-2.00%. If the user selects “Extended Range 2” checkbox 811 C, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-3.6%. These ranges extend the user selectable TDS strength range and also resize the Y-axis on the universal brewing control chart accordingly, and is useful for troubleshooting existing brewing protocols in the field that are out-of-range and off the universal brew chart region of interest Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Water Temperatures” area 812 where the user may input the starting temperature of the water in the brewer at “Start” box 813 and the actual brew temperature of the water in the brewer at “Brew” box 814 . The user may select either a degrees F. or a degrees C. scale at temperature scale selection box 812 A. For example, the user should select the Brew Temp at Brew box 814 to the programmed setting of the user's brewer (usually 195-202 Deg F.) for light to medium roasted coffees, slightly lower, i.e., 195 Deg F. for dark roasted coffees. The user may enter the start temperature at Start Temperature box 813 to what may typically be in use at home, which should be equal to either TAP water temperature or room temperature (i.e., for bottled water). Using the start and brew temperatures specified, application 602 determines the actual brew water volume and ground coffee weight required to maintain the correct brew formula ratio, a common cause of error when trying to transfer brew formulas from a commercial to a home brewer for example. Preferences window 801 further includes a “Chart Settings” area 815 for setting preferences in the universal brewing control chart that coffee design application 602 generates. In one embodiment coffee design application 602 may allow the displaying of stored or custom regions of interest for optimum balance to be overlaid onto the universal brewing control chart. Coffee taste preference “regions” have been previously defined by different organizations (i.e. Midwest Research Institute (MRI), Coffee Brewing Center (CBC), Norwegian Coffee Center (NCC) as the “Optimum Balance” regions, or, as shown, other custom regions may be added to the chart based on individual preferences found to be appropriate for particular coffees, roast styles, and or customer surveys. Such custom regions need not be rectangular, as shown, but may be any shape including three dimensional, exhibiting preferences in percentile categories. Selecting the “Show Region Labels” checkbox 816 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a label identifying the region of interest. Selecting the “Show Taste Labels” checkbox 817 instructs the coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart that displays taste defect labels (i.e., bitter or under-developed). Selecting the “Enable Zoom/Pan” checkbox 818 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart on which the user may use mouse and/or trackpad controls to zoom/pan the Universal Brewing Control Chart along with its axis. The final universal brewing control chart as configured, plotted and labeled may be saved in any commonly available formats (such as jpeg, png, bmp, emf, gif, tif), emailed, entered into a database, electronically shared, and or printed on demand. Upon completion of entering input preferences and settings in startup preferences window 801 , the user may select Done box 819 . After the Startup Preferences have been selected as described above, the user completes the brewing protocol design process in the coffee design application 602 in the Main Application Window shown in FIG. 8C. More details on using the Main Application Window discussed below with reference to FIG. 8C. However, before discussion Main Application Window in detail, it is helpful to first discuss the Universal Brewing Control Chart of FIG. 8B that coffee design application 602 produces. Coffee design application 602 performs all calculations and plots a brewing control chart dynamically and in real time as you change the % TDS strength preference slider control. Coffee design application 602 converts between different types of units instantly and accurately, and allows for mixed units (i.e., brew water in gallons, coffee yield in liters). Coffee design application 602 draws a custom brew formula line on a universal brewing control chart using any combination of selected units in weight and or volume, without restrictions to fixed portions. Application 602 also provides a relative indication of designed recipe to the measured results, in reference to a number of internationally recognized “optimum” brewing ranges. Application 602 further provides a means to troubleshoot current brewing protocols, measure and plot results which immediately identify portioning and extraction errors, and provides a means to correct them. The appearance of the Main Design Window of FIG. 8C depends on the variable the user selected to enter as the INPUT data in the Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A. Coffee design application 602 displays the computed OUTPUT data immediately below in the next group box of the window, and plots the results on the Universal Brewing Control Chart dynamically and in real time in a charting window seen in FIG. 8B. The completed data and universal brewing control chart as configured, labeled and plotted on the Main Application Window may be saved, recalled, electronically shared, printed or emailed. Each “recipe” may be stored separately, or in one embodiment of the application 602 , as part of a database residing within the application or as part of a shared networked database application. FIG. 8B shows a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 that includes a representative coffee brew formula line 821 . The Universal Brewing Control Chart plots the actual design point 822 (small circle) and measured results 823 (large circle) from input data and % TDS measurements from the disclosed coffee refractometer. FIG. 8B shows a typical universal coffee brewing control chart 820 , taken from the brew formula discussed below. FIG. 8B shows the desired brew formula line as brew formula line 821 . The brew formula line 821 represents the ratio (17.08:1) of water to coffee by weight used to brew the coffee. The resulting TDS of the brewed coffee will be determined by the brew formula, as well as other factors (temperature, grade of grind, dwell time, and turbulence). The final % TDS measurement 823 may then be followed down to the X-axis, to see how close the results (19.8%) came to the design target extraction (20.0%). The small circle 822 on the Brew Formula line shows the selected strength design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 on the brew formula line 821 shows the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring and inputting the TDS % of the brewed coffee into coffee application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. The actual resulting extraction and strength are plotted as a result of the TDS % measurement on a specialized coffee refractometer disclosed and discussed below in more detail. Universal brewing control chart 820 includes a number of coffee design target regions of interest. Chart 820 shows the George Howell Coffee Company (GHCC) suggested target region of interest as region of interest 824 for optimum balance. Chart 820 also shows a Midwest Research Institute region of interest 825 . Chart 820 further shows a target region of interest 826 defined by the Norwegian Coffee Center. FIG. 8C shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew from the starting water volume is now discussed, namely the water volume mode. The Startup Preferences discussed earlier set up the main window for this water volume mode, including brew water temperature to match the brewer boiler setting in use. The brew water volume is first calibrated, according to the brewer manufacturer specifications, to dose correctly the amount of water programmed as the starting brew water volume. The user then performs the following coffee design steps: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left-hand corner of main application window 827 . 2. Enter the preferred Brew Water units in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Water Volume field 830 , and enter the Water Volume in the Water Volume field 830 . For example, the user may enter a brew water volume value of 0.50 gal. in Water Volume field 830 . 3. Select the preferred Strength TDS % with the slider 831 on the window's left side. In response to the above described user design inputs, application software 602 determines the brew formula and the corresponding required Ground Coffee weight and final Coffee Yield. Coffee design application 602 then displays the determined Ground Coffee weight at Ground Coffee weight box 833 and displays the final Coffee Yield at Coffee Yield box 832 . Final values, including the brew formula ratio, are also displayed in the legend of the brewing control chart. The units are selectable by the user at units select boxes 834 and 835 . In this example, the resultant yield is 56.52 fl oz (US) and the ground coffee weight is 3.75 oz (wt.) The coffee design application 602 draws the brew formula curve 821 as seen in the universal coffee brewing control chart of FIG. 8D. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target Strength TDS 822 at the pre-set target extraction of 20%. 4. If not done earlier, the user may enter the preferred units of measure in the two output fields, namely Coffee Yield volume 834 and Ground Coffee weight 835 of FIG. 8C. Alternatively, the user may convert these units to any desired units using boxes 834 and 835 . 5. After brewing in accordance with the above parameters, the user may test the total dissolved solids (TDS) using the disclosed coffee refractometer. The user may enter the measured % TDS in the Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 after selecting TDS % at box 837 as the instrument readout mode. Alternatively, coffee design application 602 will provide a conversion estimate for TDS % using box 837 that may be set to ppm or BRIX if another TDS instrument or refractometer provides readings in those units. 6. The user may use a File>Save menu selection to save the brew formula, chart and portion plan, and may print the same if desired. To summarize, in the above example, beverage type was set to Hot Coffee, brew water volume was set to 0.50 gallons, and the strength slider 831 was set to 1.3% as the desired coffee strength. Coffee design application 602 determines the brew formula ratio, the required ground coffee in oz-wt and the resulting brewed coffee yield in fl-oz volume. Brew temperature was the same as start temperature at 201 Deg F. FIG. 8E shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the second mode, namely, coffee yield as input, is now discussed as coffee yield mode. Traditionally, brew formulas have been developed using a pre-set volume of brew water as part of the brew recipe. For example, a one (1) gallon batch meant setting the brewer for one gallon of brew water, and using approximately 7.5 ounces coffee (i.e., the gold-cup standard for 1.3% TDS). However, this method results in a final yield of approximately 112-fluid ounces, leaving about 16-fl oz empty in the brewing vessel. In the Desired Yield mode, the disclosed coffee design application 602 enables the user to specify one (1) gallon of finished coffee to fill the brewing vessel completely. In one embodiment, coffee design application 602 determines exact portions of brew water and ground coffee required, for example 1.13 gallons of brew water and 8.5 ounces of coffee. This design mode allows the user to specify the finished yield needed to fill a brewing thermos, rather than leave a significant percentage empty. Units can be mixed in any combination (brew water in gallons, yield in liters), and coffee design application 602 determines the required results in the units specified. For example, for a 2.5 liter thermos, 0.75 gallons brew water and 5.6 ounces of coffee will yield exactly 2.5 liters of finished coffee. To ensure accurate portions of water and coffee, coffee design application 602 takes into account the water lost in the spent basket and the volume of water required as a function of temperature. The brew basket refers to a vessel (not shown) that holds coffee grounds in the correct depth and area in the brewer for proper wetting and extraction during the coffee brewing process. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Desired Coffee Yield button 804 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8E and enters the desired coffee yield into Desired Coffee Yield box 830 as shown in FIG. 8E. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Set the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 [in the lower left corner of main application window 827 ] to select the Hot Coffee charting range. 2. Select the preferred units of measure of the Desired Yield in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Desired Yield field box 830 , and enter the Desired Yield for the finished coffee in Desired Yield field box 830 . For example, the user may select liters in box 829 and 2.35 in box 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields at Brew Water Volume unit selection box 834 and Ground Coffee Weight unit selection box 835 . In this particular example, coffee design application 602 determines the required Brew Water Volume in liters and the Ground Coffee weight required in grams. When using a commercial brewer, the user should check Start=Brew Temperature box 838 to indicate that the starting temperature is equal to the brewing temperature. 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.27 TDS % in this example. 5. After brewing a batch of coffee under the input conditions above, the user may measure the total dissolved solids in the batch of coffee from a sample thereof. The user places a sample of the brewed batch in the disclosed coffee refractometer discussed in more detail below. The coffee refractometer measures Total Dissolved Solids in percent (%). The user takes a TDS reading from the coffee refractometer and enters the measured % TDS in the “Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement” field or box 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode facilitates better coffee brewing practice in a number of ways. For example, in this design mode, application 602 determines or calculates the coffee and water portions required to nearly fill the brewing vessel completely. This mode also reduces the amount of air in a thermos or other coffee brew receptacle, and reduces the loss of aroma producing volatiles, while increasing the volume of hot coffee brewed. The additional thermal mass of coffee keeps the thermos hot longer, and can increase hold times by up to 10-15 minutes per batch. This mode may also reduce the frequency of brewing, making a coffee brewing operation more efficient. This mode may allow brewing larger batches that inherently reduces portioning errors. In the “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode in the example of FIG. 8E, the Beverage Type is set to Hot Coffee at Beverage Type drop down menu 828 , and Desired Yield is set to 2.35 Liters in boxes 830 , 832 for a 2.5 Liter Thermos receptacle. Strength slider 831 is set to 1.27% TDS. The disclosed coffee refractometer is used to test a sample of the brewed coffee. In this example, the coffee refractometer measures a TDS value of 1.3%, which is entered by the user at Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement input box 836 . In response to entering the TDS value, coffee design application 602 plots a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ as shown in FIG. 8F. Universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ shows the brew formula, namely a brew formula line 821 ′, as a brew formula ratio of 17.56 to 1. Coffee design application 602 plots a small circle 822 ′ that indicates the selected strength coffee design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 ′ on brew formula line 821 ′ indicates the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring the TDS % of the brewed coffee sample with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputting the measured TDS % into coffee design application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. Since the measured coffee results are within 0.5% of the target extraction (solubles yield) of the design target, no further adjustment is required in this example. The final coffee design recipe values are also shown in the chart Legend 840 , at the bottom of the chart 820 ′. FIG. 8G shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the third mode, namely ground coffee weight as input, is now discussed as ground coffee weight mode. Design by ground coffee weight is a commonly used in high volume feeder establishments using pre-measured, pre-ground pillow packs. While it is not preferable to pre-grind coffee for freshness reasons, this mode is provided to address such feeder establishments, so they can improve their coffee brewing practices to internationally accepted standards. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Ground Coffee Weight button 805 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8G and enters the ground coffee weight into ground coffee weight box 830 as shown in FIG. 8G. For example, if the weight of a pre-ground coffee pillow pack is 3.5 oz, then the user selects the unit ounces in unit selection box 829 and inputs 3.5 into box 830 as shown. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left corner of main application window 827 . 2. Select the preferred unit of measure in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Ground Coffee field 830 , and enter the weight in the Ground Coffee field 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields, namely Brew Water Volume and Yield. Coffee design application 602 determines or calculates the required Brew Water Volume and the final coffee Yield volume in the units selected. Start Temperature=Brew Temperature is checked at checkbox 838 . 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . In this example, the user engages slider 831 to select a strength of 1.3%. 5. After brewing coffee in accordance with the determined parameters, the user then employs the disclosed coffee refractometer to measure the total dissolved solids, TDS, of a sample of the brewed coffee. The user enters the measured % TDS in the Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This example illustrates how to design to desired strength protocols using fixed ground coffee packets by weight. Coffee design application 602 calculates the required brew Water Volume and Yield volume of coffee in the units selected. The Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 was set to Hot Coffee. Ground Coffee was set to the packet size of 3.5 ounces weight. Strength slider was set to 1.30% TDS. Dissolved Solids were measured and entered at 1.3% Coffee design application 602 draws a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ″ as shown in FIG. 8H. In FIG. 8H, box 824 ″ represents the desired target region and line 821 ″ represents the particular brew formula ratio, namely 17.19 to 1, in this particular example that employs 0.47 gallons of water and 3.5 oz (wt) of coffee to brew a batch of coffee. Small circle 822 ″ represents the desired design point on brew formula line 821 ″, while large circle 823 ″ represents the actual coffee design point determined in response to the measured TDS % of the brewed coffee batch measure in the disclosed coffee refractometer. Region 824 ″ is the particular region of interest on the brew control chart of FIG. 8H. This design mode is useful for users of pre-ground and pre-weighed fixed packs of ground coffee wishing to improve their coffee brewing protocols by providing a means to reprogram their brewers to brew to gold-cup standards, even though fixed weight packs have been provided. FIG. 8I shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 which is also useful in designing coffee concentrates. This example shows an iced coffee design, where the user selects iced coffee in Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 . The coffee design application 602 will design coffee extraction protocols for Iced Coffee Concentrate, to be brewed fresh and directly over ice. Coffee design application 602 calculates coffee concentrate TDS strength both before and after ice is melted. The process is designed to allow approximately 95% to approximately 97% percent of the ice to melt at brew completion time, so that the finished concentrate is cold, and ready to serve immediately after brewing. In one embodiment, the complete brewing cycle takes only 5-6 minutes, typically. Care should be taken using this mode to choose portions that will not overload nor overflow the brew basket. For example, a 0.5-1.0 gallon brewer may be able to brew 7-9 ounces of ground coffee, but could overflow the brew basket if more ground coffee is used. Generally, a 1.5 gallon brewer can accommodate up to 12-14 ounces ground coffee. Design by coffee weight mode is supported in this embodiment, to ensure such limitations are adhered to, and application 602 determines the required brew water volume, concentrate yield, and weight of ice required. In this example, the user sets the coffee brew strength to 3.8% using slider 831 . The user employs brew water volume as the starting value in Enter Starting Value box 830 . The units are gallons in unit selection box 829 . In this example, it is assumed that a typical 1.5 gallon brewer is being used. The brewer is programmed to dispense 0.7 gallons, yielding approximately a half-gallon (0.49 gal) of coffee at 3.7% TDS. The coffee is brewed into an open top container containing 62 ounces-weight of ice, then stirred and covered. The resulting concentrate is after serving over ice in a glass filled two-thirds will be about 1.5-1.8% TDS. Total concentrate yield is just under one gallon. This serves approximately sixteen 16-oz servings (7.5 fl oz concentrate over approximately 8 oz-wt ice). Coffee design application 602 plots the resultant brew formula ratio curve 821 ′″ as seen in FIG. 8J. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target coffee design point as small circle 822 ″. After the user measures the total dissolved solids TDS % with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputs the TDS % value, for example 3.7%, in box 836 , application 602 plots the actual coffee design point at large circle 823 ′″ on brew formula ratio line 821 ′″. FIG. 9A is a flowchart that shows process flow in the methodology that the disclosed information handling system 600 employs. In one embodiment, when loaded into system 600 , coffee design application 602 of computer program product 608 enables system 600 to carry out this methodology.

The Beverage Type drop-down menu pre-sets 828 are used to adjust the brewing and chart areas of solubles concentration (% TDS Strength) and solubles yield (% Extraction) to the appropriate ranges commonly used for brewing the selected types of beverage(s). System 600 receives the user's Beverage Type selection as input to the coffee design process. System 600 presents a slider tool 831 to the user to enable the user to select a design coffee strength, as per block 910 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.3% with the slider tool, or may also use arrow keys, touch screen controls or other methods for setting the input value. System 600 receives the user's selection of coffee strength as input to the coffee design process. System 600 determines the brew formula ratio using 1) weight of water, determined from the volume of the water at the prescribed brewing temperature 2) the target extraction percent % solubles yield) and 3) the design TDS target strength (% solubles concentration) from the slider control (i.e. coffee strength), as per block 912 . The final brew formula ratio is equal to the weight of water divided by the weight of coffee as determined by the above parameters, and remains the same regardless of the brew batch size. System 600 generates a universal control chart graph including a grid showing TDS range (%) on the y axis vs. coffee extraction (%) on the x axis, as per block 914 . Using the brew formula ratio determined in block 912 , system 600 plots and displays on the universal control chart graph the brew formula line that represents the brew formula ratio. System 600 performs tests to determine if the user selected 1) brew water volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, or 3) ground coffee weight mode at decision blocks 918 , 920 and 922 . If the user selected 1) brew water volume mode, then process flow continues to the brew water volume module of FIG. 9B, as per block 924 . If the user selected 2) desired coffee yield mode, then process flow continues to the desired coffee yield mode of FIG. 9C, as per block 926 . If the user selected 3) ground coffee weight mode, then process flow continues to ground coffee weight module of FIG. 9D, as per block 928 . FIG. 9B shows process steps that system 600 performs when the user selects the brew water volume mode. In one embodiment, coffee design application 602 instructs system 600 to carry out these process steps. System 600 asks the user to select brew water volume units, as per block 930 . In one embodiment, this is achieved by a pull-down menu or unit selection box with different volume unit selections.

Process flow continues back to the select design mode block 900 of FIG. 9A, as per block 993 . The user may then again select any coffee design mode desired. Returning again to the small form factor or hand-held information handling system (IHS) 675 of FIG. 6B, it is noted that IHS 675 receives user input in one spatial orientation or position and outputs results to its display 690 when the user moves or changes the IHS to a second spatial orientation or position. More specifically, the user may use touch screen display 690 to make user selections and provide other input while IHS 675 is in the first position. For example, the user employs touch screen display 690 to select startup preferences such as selecting one of multiple design modes, namely 1) brewing water volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, and 3) ground coffee weight mode. The user may also make other input selections shown in startup preferences of FIG. 8A while IHS 675 is oriented in the first spatial orientation. In response to such input and when the user changes the spatial orientation of the IHS to a second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 draws a universal brewing control chart such as shown in FIGS. 8B, 8 D, 8 F, 8 H and 8 J on display 690 . The displayed universal control chart displays the results of user input which may include a TDS % reading from the disclosed refractometer for a brewed coffee sample that is brewed in accordance with the coffee design parameters that coffee design application 602 determines. In one embodiment, to complete the final plot point on the universal brewing control chart, the actual measured % TDS may be entered when IHS 675 is in either the first or second spatial position. For example, the measured % TDS from the disclosed coffee refractometer may be entered on touch screen display 690 on either the universal brewing control chart on the display while the IHS exhibits the second orientation (such as vertical) or the Main Application window while the IHS exhibits the first orientation (such as horizontal) by using extended touch screen commands that appear on the universal brewing control chart, for example, as buttons or data entry boxes, in a visible layer behind the partially transparent displayed chart. Generally, IHS 675 receives the user's input selections while IHS 675 exhibits the first spatial orientation while coffee design application 602 receives the first position signal from sensor package 680 . When coffee design application 602 of IHS 675 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response determines or calculates the solution to the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . Specific recipes for any number of brew formula sessions may be stored in the IHS 675 as an integrated database in non-volatile memory 679 , and or transmitted to a database via any of a number of wireless protocols, including web-based sharing protocols, or electronically mailed to other users to share, and interactively modify, for example, based on a collaborative approach to establishing a desired brewing protocol. Such recipes may be used to control brewing protocols for an entire installed base of brewing equipment, such equipment being programmable manually or automatically to execute said protocol(s), through a manual, wired or wireless interface, for example, for feeder establishments wishing to maintain a high quality coffee brewing program to ensure consistency from cup-to-cup across its entire installed base of restaurants, cafes or coffee bars. FIG. 10A shows the disclosed refractometer 1000 that is usable to measure TDS % of a brewed coffee sample by determining the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Refractometer 1000 includes a light source 1005 such as a yellow semiconductor laser that generates 589 nm light in one embodiment. An illumination lens 1010 directs the light from light source 1005 toward prism 1015 as shown. Prism 1015 receives incident light 1017 from light source 1005 as shown. Prism 1015 is a transparent material that exhibits an index of refraction “n p ”. The user or other entity or apparatus places a coffee brew sample 1020 on prism surface 1025 in preparation for measurement of the index of refraction “n s ” that the brew sample 1020 exhibits. A collection lens 1030 collects light 1032 refracted or reflected by the prism sample interface 1034 and directs that light to a linear photo detector 1035 . The purpose of the illumination lens 1010 is to direct light from light source 1005 to prism 1015 . More specifically, the purpose of illumination lens 1010 is to form a focusing beam or cone of light incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 that ranges in angles of incidence between a minimum angle of incidence, θ min , and a maximum angle of incidence, θ max . The angle of incidence is measured relative to the normal surface 1027 which is perpendicular to the prism surface 1025 . In one embodiment, the critical angle q c of the prism-sample interface 1034 should be such that θ min <θ c <θ max . A unique property of the critical angle is that for all angles larger than than θ c , 100% of the light is reflected from the interface 1034 and none transmits. For angles inside of the prism 1015 that are less than θ c , some light transmits into the sample material 1020 and therefore less than 100% of the light is reflected. In other words, for all rays in the beam of light generated by illumination lens 1010 that are focused in the prism to an incident angle greater than the critical angle θ c , 100% of the light is reflected off of the prism-material interface 1034 and propagates towards the collection lens 1030 and then on to the linear detector 1035 or photodetector. The light ray that is incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 at θ c will strike the linear detector 1035 at a point x=x c . By analyzing the detected light levels from x=0 to x=x max on the detector 1035 , the firmware 1047 or software of the refractometer detects the position x c since for x c <x<x max , the light level is substantially constant across the detector array 1035 . With a well-calibrated refractometer, the detector position x c is mapped back to a critical angle θ c , which from EQUATION 8 below and knowing the index of refraction of the prism n p , the index of refraction n s of the sample can be determined and displayed or otherwise reported. θ c =arcsin( n s /n p )  Equation 8 Therefore, in refractometer 1000 the index of refraction of the prism 1015 must satisfy n p >n s for all values of n s desired to be measured in order for a critical angle θ c to exist. Given the range of θ c resulting from the range of n s to be measured, the illumination lens 1010 arrangement is designed to include this range of angles relative to the surface normal 1027 of surface 1025 . Similarly, the collection lens 1030 is designed such that the range of angles θ c are linearly mapped to positions x on the linear detector array 1035 . By way of example, for a refractometer designed to operate with a sugar solution between 0 and 10° BRIX at 20° C., one requires the ability to detect indices of refraction ranging from 1.3330 to 1.3479. Using a source with a wavelength of λ 0 =589 nm and a prism made of BK7 (n p =1.5167 @λ 0 ), the range of critical angles to detect are θ c =61.50° to 62.71°. Choosing an Eastman Kodak (Rochester, N.Y.) linear CCD array model KLI-2113 with an array of 2098 pixels for linear detector 1035 , the theoretical resolution is 7E-6 in index of refraction and 0.005° BRIX. In addition to being wavelength sensitive, the index of refraction for any material changes slightly with temperature. For water at 20° C. (68° F.) the index of refraction is 1.333 and changes by −0.0001 for every degree C. The disclosed coffee refractometer includes automatic temperature compensation as described in more detail below. Refractometer 1000 includes a microcontroller 1045 with control firmware 1047 or control software therein. Microcontroller 1045 includes a memory store 1049 for storage of information and data. Refractometer 1000 also includes a temperature sensor 1050 near the prism-sample interface 1034 of prism 1015 . Temperature sensor 1050 couples to an input of microcontroller 1045 to inform microcontroller 1045 of the current temperature of the prism-sample interface 1034 . A control line 1055 couples microcontroller 1045 to light source 1005 to enable microcontroller 1045 to control light source 1005 . Refractometer 1000 also includes a display 1060 to allow refractometer 1000 to display measurement results such as a TDS % value of the brew sample 1020 . Refractometer 1000 further includes a network interface 1065 that enables refractometer 1000 to connect via wire or wirelessly to other information handling systems 600 or the Internet 1070 . Information handling system 600 may include coffee design application 602 which uses the TDS % coffee brew sample result from the refractometer 1000 as input for coffee design universal control chart display purposes. FIG. 10B is a block diagram of a brewing station 1075 that employs the disclosed coffee design system 600 and the disclosed coffee refractometer 1000 . In one embodiment, coffee brewing station 1075 includes a hot water supply 1076 and a brew basket assembly 1077 where coffee grounds mix with hot water to form a coffee drink. As the coffee drink exits brew basket 1077 , the coffee drink flows downward into a vessel 1078 that captures the brewed coffee. Vessel 1078 dispenses brewed coffee to coffee pot 1079 or other container suitable for transporting of the brewed coffee to the coffee drinker. In one embodiment, a coffee refractometer 1000 is situated in vessel 1077 so that refractometer 1000 may determine the TDS reading of a freshly brewed batch of coffee immediately after brewing. A user may take a reading of the TDS % of the coffee from the display of refractometer 1000 . The user may then manually input the TDS % reading into coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 . In response, coffee design application 602 displays the actual TDS % and extraction on the plotted brew line of a universal brew line chart such as seen in FIG. 5. In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 10B, refractometer 1000 couples to, or otherwise communicates with IHS 600 . In this manner, refractometer 1000 reads and supplies TDS % data to coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 without manual user intervention. FIG. 11A is a flowchart that depicts process steps for configuring refractometer 1000 to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % of a brew coffee sample. To use refractometer 1000 to measure the total dissolved solids (TDS) of coffee or any other liquid, refractometer 1000 should be both calibrated and correlated. The calibration of a refractometer is performed by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. The correlation of a refractometer is the conversion of the measured index of refraction to a scale of interest to the end user. Typically, refractometers have software that correlates to a BRIX scale. In that case the software assumes that the index of refraction of the liquid presented to the refractometer corresponds to a sugar-water solution and will output a BRIX value (equal to the % sugar by weight in solution) based upon the measured refractive index. Unfortunately, for most other liquids, such as coffee, a BRIX scale is not valid and can lead to erroneous results. To configure refractometer 1000 to measure the TDS of a brewed coffee sample, process flow commences at start block 1105 in the flowchart of FIG. 11A. A user or other entity first calibrates refractometer 1000 , as per block 1110 . The calibration of refractometer 1000 is performed in the conventional manner by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. To correlate refractometer 1000 for coffee, the change in index of refraction with TDS as well as temperature is determined. The user or other entity begins correlation of refractometer 1000 , as per block 1115 . One exemplary and preferred method of determining the TDS of a coffee solution is through a dehydration method. To start the correlation procedure, different batches of coffee are brewed at different brew concentrations, while maintaining approximately the same extraction percentage from the selected batch of roasted and ground coffee beans, as per block 1120 . In other words, the user or other entity brews multiple coffee samples with different respective coffee concentrations in terms of total dissolved solids (TDS) %. The extraction percentage set during the refractometer correlation procedure is preferably the extraction percentage chosen as that of an ideal coffee solution for consumption. For purposes of example, the extraction percentage is 20%±1% although it is possible to employ other extraction percentages if desired depending on the application and user preference. For an accurate correlation procedure, it is preferable that the extraction percentage remains approximately constant because coffee grinds are composed of a mix of different materials that have different water solubility rates. The materials that have a high water solubility rate are extracted first from the coffee grinds and give the coffee a sweet flavor. Those materials that have a lower water solubility rate are extracted later in the brewing process and give the coffee a bitter flavor. Each of these different materials contained within coffee affect the index of refraction of water differently when they dissolve into it. Therefore for accurate correlation of the index of refraction of coffee to TDS, it is preferred that the extraction percentage is kept approximately constant. Note further that during the described correlation procedure it is preferred that the coffee used to make the different batches of coffee concentrations are from the same green and roast batch, and further, that they are ground to the same grade. For example, all-purpose universal Drip Grind would be derived of 8% Numbers 10/14 sieves, 65% Numbers, 27% Pan for a nominal particle size of 775 Microns (1 Micron-0.001 mm), according to the North American Coffee Industry Norms as published by Modern Process Equipment, Inc. If required, a separate correlation procedure can be conducted for each coffee bean of interest and/or different degrees of roast to determine refractometer correlation equations for these bean and roast changes. For the brew concentrations that have the same extraction percentage, it is preferred that they encompass the range of TDS expected for the consumable coffee of interest. By way of example, the brew samples can span a 0.8% to 4.0% TDS range, since 1% to 1.5% TDS represents the typical range for coffee, and 3% to 4% represents the typical range for ice coffee concentrate. For expresso, the brew concentration of 2 to 6% TDS is typically of interest with the TDS range of 4 to 5% being preferable. For expresso, given that it contains a certain percentage of undissolved solids, these solids would need to be filtered before following the dehydration procedure outlined below. Samples of each brew concentration are allowed to cool in respective sealed vial, as per block 1125 . Refractometer 1000 then measures not only the index of refraction of the sample but also the temperature of the sample. More particularly, refractometer 1000 measures the index of refraction (n s ) for each brew concentration sample across a range of temperatures as per block 1130 . For the correlation of refractometer 1000 for use outside of the brewing machine itself, a temperature range corresponding to ranges of ambient room temperatures are preferred such as 20 to 30° C. and index of refraction measurements can, for example, be taken in 1° C. increments. For a refractometer 1000 to be used to measure the index of refraction of coffee after it is brewed, the desired temperature range may be 70 to 90° C. with measurements taken every 2° C. as part of the correlation process. These correlation measurements are useful to derive the thermal dependence of the index of refraction for a specific brew concentration (i.e., a specific TDS). To determine the TDS of each of the brew concentrations, containers (for example, glass beakers) are marked and weighed (preferable to an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 or better), as per block 1135 (1 st weight reading). Portions of each brewed coffee solution are poured into individual containers (not shown) and the filled containers are reweighed (2 nd weight reading), as per block 1140 . The filled containers are then placed into a dehydration oven, as per block 1145 . After the solutions have been dehydrated or desiccated, the containers are allowed to cool in a dry environment in order to prevent any subsequent moisture absorption, as per block 1150 . The containers are then reweighed (3 rd weight reading) preferably in a dry environment, also as per block 1155 . From these three weight readings, the weight of the dissolved solids and the weight of the original solution is derived, and therefore the TDS (equal to the ratio of these two measurements) is derived. In more detail, assuming eight brewed samples of coffee of different TDS spanning 0.8 to 4.0% and ten temperature readings per sample, 80 data points are thus provided that map a three-dimensional space in TDS, temperature and refractive index. Taking TDS as the dependent variable, the TDS surface plot as a function of temperature and refractive index can be curve fit to find an equation that expresses TDS as a function of index of refraction (n) and temperature (T), (i.e. f(n, T)) as per block 1160 . Generally speaking, the curve fit of such data will be suitably fit by a linear function in index of refraction and a quadratic function of temperature. Curve fitting methods such as least squares, gradient descent, and others methods may be used. See for example, C. Daniel and F. S. Wood, Fitting Equations to Data: Computer Analysis of Multifactor Data , (John Wiley & Sons, NY, N.Y.), 1980] The TDS formula for a fixed temperature T 0 is given by EQUATION 9 below: TDS ⁡ ( n , T 0 ) = [ n ⁡ ( T 0 ) - n 0 ⁡ ( T 0 ) ] C , EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 9 where n 0 is the index of refraction at which the curve fit indicates that the TDS is zero. Note that n 0 may not necessarily correspond with the exact index of refraction measured for pure water. Assuming that the range of index of refraction and hence TDS is relatively small, such as is the case for normal coffee, the constant C can be approximated to be temperature independent. In order to adjust for temperatures, the thermal dependence of index of refraction should be taken into account. The thermal dependence of index of refraction n for a fixed TDS coffee solution is approximated by a quadratic equation in temperature T according to EQUATION 10 below. n=n 0 +a ( T−T 0 )+ b ( T−T 0 ) 2 Equation 10 where a and b are constants derived from the curve fitting of data and the index of refraction equation is expressed such that at T=T 0 , the index of refraction is equal to n 0 . To the first order, the TDS formula that takes into account both index of refraction and temperature. for coffee is given by EQUATION 11 below. TDS ⁡ ( n , T ) = [ n - n 01 - a 1 ⁢ ( T - T 0 ) - b 1 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 ] C 1 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 11 where n 01 , a 1 , b 1 , and C 1 may be slightly different from the constants n 0 , a, b, and C 1 of EQUATIONS. (3) and (4) depending upon the data fit. Although EQUATION 11 may be used, for a more accurate fit of the data, particularly for higher values of TDS, it is preferred to fit the data to a full quadratic in both index of refraction n and temperature T. Although such a quadratic equation can be expressed in multiple forms that are essentially identical from the standpoint of a refractometer's electronics and/or software calculating the result, a convenient form, from the standpoint of person reading the equation is given by EQUATION 12 below. TDS ⁡ ( n , T ) = [ n - n 02 + d 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) 2 - a 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) - b 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 + e 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) ⁢ ( T - T 0 ) ] C 2 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 12 since the TDS is referenced to a control temperature T 0 and the index of refraction of n 02 , which is substantially equal to the index of refraction of pure water at a temperature T 0 , but may deviate slightly depending upon the empirical fit of the data in the index-temperature parameter space of interest. A formula such as the one represented in EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into the firmware 1085 or electronics of refractometer 1000 to correlate refractometer 1000 for the liquids (e.g., coffee), concentrations, and temperatures ranges of interest. In other words, the formula of either EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into, installed or otherwise stored in firmware 1047 of microcontroller 1045 in refractometer 1000 , as per block 1160 , for use in determining TDS of a particular coffee brew sample from index of refraction data and temperature data that refractometer 1000 provides. Storing the TDS formula of EQUATION 11 or 12 in refractometer 1000 in this manner completes the correlation of refractometer 100 for coffee solutions of interest. In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction, but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 or 12 provide respective polynomial expressions that approximate or represent TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATION 11 provides a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 12, TDS (n,T) varies as a quadratic function of index of refraction and also as a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 and 12 both provide a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). It should be noted that the previously cited equations are at a specific measurement wavelength since index of refraction of all materials, including coffee, will vary with the incident wavelength. Typically this wavelength is at or near the Sodium D line of 589 nm. However, other fixed wavelengths are acceptable as well. It is also noted that different coffee varieties, different degree of roasts, different levels of extraction during brew, extraction temperatures, and other brew variables can all affect the correlation to a small degree, such that some correlations of refractive index to brew solids may result in a better fit for darker versus lighter roasts. Separate scales for each range of degree of roasts may be correlated using Agtron or similar methods for determining the degree of roast. Microcontroller 1045 uses temperature sensor 1050 to determine and/or set the temperature of both the prism 1015 and the sample 1020 . Although not shown in FIG. 10A, microcontroller 1045 may control a resistive heater and thermo-electric cooler designed to bring the sample touching the prism face to a desired temperature. Since index of refraction changes with temperature and typically in a non-linear fashion, it is desirable to compensate for temperature effects. As such, in the design of the refractometer 1000 , it is desirable that the angles of incidences of the illumination beam at the entrance face of the prism and of the reflected beam at the exit face be minimized or at least compensated thermally since refraction at these interfaces will be a function of temperature. Likewise, the focal lengths of illumination lens 1010 and collection lens 1030 are a function of wavelength and to thermally compensate the temperature-dependent optical power, the lenses are preferably mounted to a mechanical mount whose thermal expansion compensates for the changes in the optical power of the lenses. Residual thermal changes to the refractometer's ability to measure index of refraction can be compensated using a lookup table based upon the readout of the temperature sensor 1050 that adds a correction factor to the critical angle detected by the refractometer. To increase the resolution of refractometer 1000 , the operating index of refraction range can be reduced and the number of detector pixels increased. Above, as a clarifying example, a refractometer was described that worked for a range of sugar solutions of 0 to 10° BRIX using an Eastman Kodak KLI-2113 linear CCD with 2098 pixels. The resolution for this example was stated as 1.4E-5 in index of refraction and 0.0095° BRIX. If instead, an Eastman Kodak Model KLI-8023 linear CCD having a length of 8002 pixels and the BRIX scale desired were reduced to 0 to 5° BRIX, the resolution can be improved by a factor of 7.6 to 1.8E-6 in index of refraction and 0.0013° BRIX. In an alternate embodiment the linear detector is not increased in size and in fact may be reduced in array size. To achieve a higher resolution the detector is scanned along the beam produced by illumination lens 1030 in order to locate the beam intensity transition point representing the critical angle. In order to properly read out the critical angle, the scanning detector should be mounted to an encoder to that its position is known. FIG. 11B is a flowchart that describes process steps that refractometer 1000 employs to take a TDS reading for a brewed coffee sample. Process flow commences at start block 1170 . The user or other entity may calibrate refractometer 1000 , as per block 1172 . The user or other entity may place a brewed coffee sample in refractometer 1000 for the purpose of taking a TDS % reading via index of refraction measure. Refractometer 1000 takes an index of refraction reading of the brewed coffee sample, as per block 1176 , under the control of firmware 1047 . Microcontroller 1045 reads data from the light received by linear detector 1035 to determine the index of refraction of the brew coffee sample. In one embodiment, microcontroller 1045 of refractometer 1000 takes a temperature reading of the prism-sample interface 1034 , as per block 1178 . Refractometer 100 provides automatic temperature compensation for index of refraction readings of brew coffee samples, as per block 1180 . Refractometer 1000 accesses the TDS formula of EQUATION 11 or 12 that firmware 1047 or memory 1049 stores to determine the TDS % of the brewed coffee sample, as per block 1182 . Refractometer 1000 displays the determined TDS % for the brewed coffee sample on refractometer display 1060 , as per block 1184 . Conveniently, refractometer 1000 provides a TDS % reading directly to the user via display 1060 . Refractometer 1186 then sends the determined TDS % to coffee design application 602 in information handling system 600 for display on the universal brewing control chart, as per block 1186 . As discussed above, refractometer 1000 includes a network interface 1065 that couples to the Internet either by wire or wirelessly, and that may also coupled to another IHS 600 either by wire or wirelessly. In this manner, IHS 600 or another IHS on the Internet may provide updating to onboard firmware 1047 in refractometer 1000 . Refractometer 1000 may also receive updated or new scales via the Internet or IHS 600 in this manner. Refractometer 1000 may employ a wired or wireless connection to send information and data to coffee design application 602 in IHS 600 in this manner.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the processing of coffee, typically the first step is to subject green coffee beans to a roasting process. This process causes thermal decomposition and chemical changes within the beans at which time the familiar aroma and flavour development occurs. A by-product of the roasting process is carbon dioxide gas. Following roasting, coffee almost immediately begins to release carbon dioxide. When in the whole bean state the release of carbon dioxide gas is relatively slow. In some cases it may take in excess of two weeks for all internal carbon dioxide gas built up during the roasting process to be released. In contrast, grinding coffee beans to produce ground roasted coffee results in the release of carbon dioxide and volatile aromatics over a much shortened time frame. As a result of the discharge of carbon dioxide gas, tightly packaged coffee that has not been sufficiently degassed can cause an undesired expansion (and in some cases rupture) of packaging materials. For that reason both roasted coffee beans and ground roasted coffee are commonly transported and stored in bins or open containers following the roasting/grinding process where they are allowed to degas for anywhere from a few hours to upwards of one to two days so that the product that is eventually packaged is essentially carbon dioxide free. Ground roasted coffee also readily absorbs atmospheric moisture and is a good desiccant. In addition, whether it be whole bean or ground, roasted coffee oxidizes when it comes into contact with air, resulting in increased levels of acidity and a general degradation in taste. For these reasons, after being sufficiently degassed coffee is often vacuum packaged in a tightly sealed container to avoid continued contact with air. Alternately, coffee is sometimes packaged in a nitrogen filled container in order to avoid oxidation through contact with air. Unfortunately, the above described methods of processing roasted coffee suffer from a number of substantial draw backs that affect the flavour and aroma of the coffee, and ultimately its price and desirability to consumers. First, degassing coffee increases exposure of the coffee to air and results in enhanced oxidation. Commonly used bulk handling techniques further exasperate the oxidation problem by increasing the contact of the roasted coffee with air. In addition, typical bulk handling equipment that is used in coffee processing (for example conveyor belts, screw conveyors, air conveyors etc.) have a tendency to separate fine and coarse particles and can result in an uneven mixing of fine and coarse particles within individual packaged portions. Ground coffee that is allowed to come into contact with air for any extended length of time runs the risk of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere causing a reduction in the quality of the coffee. It has also been found that a substantial portion of the aromatics associated with roasted coffee are stripped off from either the whole bean or the ground product when the carbon dioxide liberated from the coffee is removed. Appreciating that a significant loss of the aromatics from roasted coffee results in a degradation of the coffee's flavour and taste, others have developed elaborate systems that attempt to capture volatile aromatics, and later condense and process them for use in the production of instant coffee crystals. Finally, a further limitation associated with current coffee processing methods concerns the common practice of vacuum packaging coffee. Where coffee has been packaged within a container under a vacuum environment, immediately upon opening the container the coffee is instantly, and forcefully, aerated causing enhanced and accelerated oxidation. There is therefore a need for an improved method of processing roasted coffee that addresses a number of the limitations present in such methods as are currently in use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention therefore provides a method of processing roasted coffee that provides a means to minimize oxidation, maximize the retention of volatile aromatics, minimize moisture absorption and helps to minimize the separation of fine and course particles in the event that the coffee is subjected to a grinding process. Accordingly, in one of its aspects the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee to improve the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the roasted coffee, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving coffee therein; purging said containers of contained air through flushing said containers with an inert gas; transporting and delivering roasted coffee to a grinding circuit; grinding said roasted coffee directly into a container filling apparatus; with said container filling apparatus, delivering said ground coffee directly into said purged containers; and, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee and to minimize contact of said ground roasted coffee with the air. In a further aspect the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee beans to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the coffee beans following roasting, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving roasted coffee beans therein, purging said containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas and thereafter maintaining said purged containers in a generally upright position with said inert gas retained therein to prevent the influx of air into said purged containers, without delay and without allowing said roasted coffee beans to accumulate in storage bins or staging areas transporting and delivering said roasted coffee beans directly to a container filling apparatus, with said container filling apparatus delivering said roasted coffee beans directly into said purged containers, and, thereafter, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee beans and to minimize contact of said roasted coffee beans with the air. In yet a further aspect the invention provides a method of processing roasted coffee to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide gas and aromatics liberated from the coffee, the method comprising the steps of preparing one or more containers for receiving roasted coffee therein, purging said containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas and maintaining said purged containers in a generally upright position with said inert gas retained therein, transporting and delivering roasted coffee to a grinding circuit located within an enclosure having an oxygen depleted atmosphere, grinding said coffee directly into a container filling apparatus, with said container filling apparatus delivering said ground coffee directly into said purged containers, sealing said containers to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from said roasted coffee and to minimize the contact of said roasted coffee with the air, said steps of said method completed with minimal delay between successive steps to minimize the loss of carbon dioxide gas liberated from said coffee prior to the sealing of said coffee within said containers. Further aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken together with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show more clearly how it may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings which show the preferred embodiments of the present invention in which: FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing that graphically depicts the primary stages of one of the embodiments of the preferred method according to the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention may be embodied in a number of different forms. However, the specification and drawings that follow describe and disclose only some of the specific forms of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims that follow herein. According to the method of the present invention, one or more containers are prepared for receiving and packaging coffee therein. Depending upon the end use of the packaged coffee, shipping requirements, retail display considerations and other factors, it will be appreciated that a wide variety of different containers or packages may be utilized. For example, the containers may be of a rigid variety formed from metallic alloys, cellulose products, and/or plastics or other synthetic materials. Similarly, the containers may also be of a flexible or semi-rigid variety, including pre-formed synthetic bags, or bags made from cellulose or other textile materials coated for gas impermeability. In other instances the containers may be constructed from continuous rolls of plastic or other synthetic material that are cut and hermetically sealed to desired sizes in what is often referred to as a form, fill and seal circuit. Regardless of the particular form of container utilized, the preparation of the containers for receiving coffee typically involves the placement of the containers on a conveyor belt or other assembly system such that they can be filled and sealed or form filled and sealed in an efficient and timely fashion. The preparation of the containers for receiving coffee pursuant to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes purging the containers of contained air through flushing with an inert gas. Most commonly inert gas would be supplied to the containers through a series of flushing lines directed into the containers while on the assembly line of a processing plant operation. The inert gas used to purge the containers in many cases will have a density either exceeding or relatively close to that of air. Once flushed and purged, the containers proceed through subsequent processing stages in a generally upright orientation to allow the inert gas to remain within the interior of the containers, thereby preventing the influx of air. While a variety of different non-toxic inert gases could be utilized, due to its general availability and relative inexpense, in a preferred embodiment of the invention nitrogen gas is used to purge the containers. The method of the present invention also calls for the transporting and delivering of roasted coffee to a grinding circuit in one embodiment, or for transporting and delivering whole roasted coffee beans directly to a container filling apparatus in an alternate embodiment. Through a thorough understanding of the invention it will be appreciated that the invention is independent of the precise roasting method that is employed, and that a variety of different methods of roasting and roasting equipment could be used. For example, a typical roasting process could involve subjecting green coffee beans to temperatures of between approximately 390 and 460 degrees Fahrenheit causing pyrolysis or thermal decomposition within the beans. At elevated temperatures in this range water is evaporated from the beans followed by pyrolysis causing chemical changes within the bean that result in the familiar aroma and flavour of roasted coffee. During the pyrolysis process carbon dioxide gas is formed and typically builds up within internal cavities in the coffee beans. The specific target temperature to which the coffee beans are elevated and the length of time that they are maintained at that temperature can vary dramatically depending upon the nature and origin of the beans and the desired flavour and colour of the end product. In general, higher roasting temperatures maintained for longer lengths of time result in a somewhat stronger, more robust and darker flavoured coffee. In any event, once the coffee has reached a specific target temperature and has been maintained at that level for the desired length of time the coffee is typically quenched to slow down or retard the pyrolysis reaction. Again the specific method of quenching the roasted coffee may vary broadly, however, typically the hot roasted coffee beans are passed through a cooling chamber where their temperature is reduced through exposure to air, or through quenching with water or or an inert gas such as nitrogen. In accordance with the present invention the coffee exiting the roasting process is preferably quenched and cooled to a temperature of between approximately 80 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Thereafter, in one preferred embodiment the roasted coffee beans are quickly transported and delivered to a grinding circuit to reduce the coffee to granules of a desired size range. The roasted beans are preferably delivered to the grinding circuit without delay to avoid loss of carbon dioxide and to minimize oxidation. As a means to minimize the contact of the beans with air, they may be transported to the grinding circuit in an oxygen depleted environment. Such an environment can be attained through the use of a screw conveyor, by injecting or blowing carbon dioxide or an inert gas onto the beans during transport, or through transporting the coffee within a sealed enclosure where the oxygen has been removed or depleted. When delivered to the grinding circuit the extent to which the coffee is ground will be to a large part dependent upon the coffee's end use. For most residential and commercial uses a granule size of between approximately 0.01 inches and 0.1 inches (Tyler screen size of between #10 and #50 mesh) is sufficient. The particular type of grinding equipment that is utilized has little, if any, bearing upon the invention. Practically any commonly used coffee grinding apparatus could be used. It is expected that in most instances the coffee beans will be ground through the use of a traditional roller mill. Since the grinding of roasted coffee beans accelerates the release of carbon dioxide, in the preferred embodiment of the present inventive method the beans are ground to within their desired size range and deposited immediately and directly into a container filling apparatus that delivers the ground coffee directly into the previously prepared and purged containers. Preferably the grinding circuit is positioned immediately above the filling apparatus such that the ground coffee granules fall directly into the filler apparatus as they exit the grinding and sizing machinery. Essentially, the coffee is “ground” directly into the filling apparatus. Once received within the filling apparatus, the ground roasted coffee is delivered directly to the purged containers by way of a screw conveyor, through a gravity feed mechanism, or through a feeding weigh scale apparatus that deposits coffee into the containers on the basis of weight as opposed to volume. It has been found that in some cases the liberation of carbon dioxide gas from the ground coffee may be significant enough to remove the necessity of purging the containers. In such instances the coffee is ground directly into upright containers that have not been previously flushed with inert gas. Being more dense than air, the carbon dioxide given off by the ground coffee displaces air within the container until the container is essentially oxygen free. With the liberation of carbon dioxide from the coffee generally enhanced at elevated temperatures, the containers may also be heated or cooled as required to stabilize carbon dioxide production and to assist in controlling the amount of oxygen within the container. When coffee is ground not only is the liberation and loss of the carbon dioxide greatly accelerated, so to is the potential for oxidation. For that reason under the present method there is preferably no airveying or conveying of ground coffee through the use of conveyor belts or similar commonly used bulk handling equipment that expose the product to the air. To further reduce oxidation and enhance carbon dioxide retention, an external source of carbon dioxide or inert gas may be supplied to the grinding and/or filling circuits. Blowing carbon dioxide or inert gas into grinding and/or filling circuits tends to reduce oxygen levels within the working environment and minimize the contact of the coffee with oxygen present in the air. Alternately, the grinding and/or filling stages may be carried out within sealed enclosures that either have substantially all of the oxygen within them removed or that operate in a modified oxygen depleted atmosphere. Typically where the grinding and/or filling stages are enclosed, they would be vacuumed or flushed with carbon dioxide or an inert gas (such as nitrogen) to remove or reduce oxygen levels. Thereafter, once grinding and filling commences the natural liberation of carbon dioxide from the coffee will have a tendency of maintaining a zero, or a substantially depleted, oxygen level within the immediate atmosphere surrounding the coffee. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the above described process may be repeated for whole bean coffee processing, with the exclusion of the grinding stage. When processing whole bean coffee, the roasted beans are transported and delivered directly to the container filling apparatus for deposition within the containers in the same fashion as described above with respect to ground roasted coffee. Once again, to minimize oxidation and the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics, the roasted beans are delivered from the roasting circuit to the container filling apparatus without delay, and without allowing the beans to accumulate in storage bins or staging areas as has traditionally been the practice when degassing. In addition, and as in the case of the method of processing ground coffee described above, the beans may be transported from the roasting circuit to the subsequent container filling apparatus in an oxygen depleted environment. This may be accomplished through the use of enclosed screw conveyors, by injecting carbon dioxide or inert gases into the bean transportation circuit, or by transporting the beans from the roasting to the filling stages within a sealed enclosure which the oxygen has been removed or depleted. Whether handling whole roasted coffee beans or ground roasted coffee, following deposition of the coffee within the previously prepared and purged containers the containers are thereafter sealed to maximize the retention of carbon dioxide and aromatics liberated from the coffee, and to minimize contact of the coffee with air. Depending upon the particular construction of the container, the method of sealing may vary. For example, where the containers are rigid and formed from metal alloys, cellulose, or synthetic plastics, rigid lids may be applied through methods commonly used in the canning and packaging industries. Where the containers are in the form of flexible synthetic bags, typically their tops would be hermetically sealed or enclosed with the use of adhesives. Under the above described method, the amount of time from the point when coffee beans exit the roasting circuit until they are either directly packaged within containers or ground and then subsequently packaged is kept to a minimum. The roasted coffee is not allowed to sit in storage bins or staging areas to degas. For that reason the coffee will continue to liberate a significant amount of carbon dioxide gas after it has been packaged and sealed within its container. To accommodate this liberation of gas, in the preferred embodiment of the invention the containers are equipped with a pressure-sensitive one-way valve that permits internal gas pressure that exceeds a pre-determined value to be bled off from the interior of the container. The one-way nature of the valve also prevents the influx of air into the container and maintains a high inert gas and/or carbon dioxide environment within the container. The pressure sensitivity of the valve ensures that the valve normally remains in a closed position, in which case the integrity of the seal of the container is maintained. Only when the internal gas pressure exceeds a pre-determined value will the valve begin to slightly open to allow pressure to be bled off. It will be appreciated that the construction of the container and the materials from which it is formed will to a large extent dictate the pressure at which the one-way valve must bleed off built-up internal pressure to maintain the integrity of the container. To prevent air from entering the container the valve should be designed so that it will only open when the internal gas pressure exceeds the outside atmospheric pressure by a specified amount. It will be appreciated from an understanding of the above description that utilization of the method to process and package either roasted coffee beans or ground roasted coffee will result in minimal oxidation of the coffee and minimal loss of liberated carbon dioxide and aromatics. Directly transporting coffee between successive stages in the process with minimal or no delays reduces the overall time from roasting to packaging to within a preferred range of from one to five minutes. Since at no point is the coffee allowed to be retained within storage bins or staging areas to degasify, the opportunity for oxidation and the loss of aromatics is significantly reduced. In addition, when processing ground coffee, grinding the coffee and depositing it immediately and directly into a filler apparatus without the employment of conveyor systems and other commonly used bulk handling machinery further and significantly reduces the time from roasting to packaging and the exposure of the coffee to air. Finally, carrying out the transportation, grinding and/or filling operations within sealed enclosures having an oxygen depleted atmosphere virtually eliminates the opportunity for any significant oxidation of the coffee before packaging and further helps to prevent the loss of liberated carbon dioxide which carries with it valuable and desirable aromatics. As a result, coffee processed and packaged according to the described method tends to be fresher, less acidic, better tasting, and generally has a better aroma. Since the method minimizes the exposure of the roasted coffee to air, the coffee is less susceptible to the deleterious effects of moisture retention that can result through exposure to air, particularly in the case of ground roasted coffee. It is to be understood that what has been described are the preferred embodiments of the invention and that it may be possible to make variations to these embodiments while staying within the broad scope of the invention. Some of these variations have been discussed while others will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.","6861086"

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to liquid coffee concentrates, methods of producing and assessing the quality of liquid coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Consumers produce the traditional “pot of coffee” by extracting the desired components of roast and ground coffee using an automatic drip coffee maker (ADC) or other form of brewer. Although the flavor and aroma of such a coffee beverage is highly desired and appreciated, the inconvenience of the brewing process has lead to the development of instant coffee and coffee concentrate products that allow the consumer to quickly make a single cup of coffee. Unfortunately, the production processes used to produce such coffee products result in finished products having ratios of flavor and aroma components that are different from fresh brewed coffee. As a result, coffee beverages produced from such concentrated products do not have the highly desired flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee. Since the flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee is especially desired by consumers, attempts have been made to improve the flavor and aroma of products made from coffee concentrates. Such attempts include incorporating volatile aroma flavor components into the finished concentrates, and the intensification of such components by the application of thermal energy. While such attempts are appreciated, there remains a need for a liquid coffee concentrate having the same ratios of flavor and aroma components as that of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the coffee concentrate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicant's invention relates to a liquid coffee concentrate having a furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value that is from about 50% to about 210% of the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Applicants also claim methods of producing and assessing the quality of coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. DETAILED DESCRIPTION A. Definitions As used herein, the term “coffee product” includes, but is not limited to coffee concentrates, coffee extracts and fresh brewed coffee. As used herein, the term “coffee concentrate” means a coffee extract that has undergone additional processing, such as thermal treatment. As used herein, the term “pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's pyridine and 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting pyridine's peak area value is divided by said 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran's peak area value. As used herein, the term “furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's furfuryl acetate and 4-ethyl guaiacol peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting furfuryl acetate's peak area value is divided by said 4-ethyl guaiacol's peak area value. As used herein, the term “unit operation” includes, but is not limited to, equipment used to transfer heat such as heaters and coolers; holders; and transfer lines. All percentages and ratios are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, the articles a and an, when used in a claim, are understood to mean at least one of the components that are claimed or described. Publications, patents, and patent applications are referred to throughout this disclosure. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. B. Coffee Concentrate Characteristics and Preparation The quality of any ready-to-use coffee product, made from a coffee concentrate, is dependent on the properties of the concentrate. Although coffee concentrates contain innumerable aroma and flavor components, Applicants discovered that the flavor and aroma of products made from concentrate approaches that of fresh brewed coffee when the concentrate's ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol approaches the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the concentrate. In addition to discovering the correlation between the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol, and flavor and aroma, Applicants discovered that a coffee concentrate's ratio of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol can be adjusted by the application of thermal energy to the concentrate. While evaluating the suitability of thermal processing, Applicants discovered that the entire, rather than just the hold tube portion, of a time and temperature profile must be considered. Applicants also recognized that the suitability of any set of thermal processing conditions is not only time and magnitude dependent but rate dependent as well. As a result, more common thermal processing descriptors such as Fo are insufficient to describe the thermal processing conditions that will result in the flavor and aroma improvements of Applicants' invention. Thus, Applicants' processing conditions are described in terms of equivalent times and temperatures, as thermal processing conditions that are time, magnitude and rate dependent can be effectively and efficiently described by these descriptors. A detailed description of Applicants' coffee concentrate and processes of making said concentrate is set forth in detail below. 1. Coffee Concentrate Embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 50% to about 210% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 65% to about 150% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Still other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 80% to about 120% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. 2. Process of Making Coffee Concentrate Coffee extracts that can be thermally processed according to Applicants' process can be prepared by any suitable process used to produce a coffee extract. Preferably, said coffee extracts are non-hydrolysed liquids having pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio values of from about 3:1 to about 25:1 and solids contents of from about 2.3% to about 25% by weight. Other preferred non-hydrolysed liquid coffee extracts include those extracts having a pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value of from about 4:1 to about 20:1 and a solids content of from about 3.5% to about 10% by weight; and those extracts having a pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value of from about 4.5:1 to about 15:1 and a solids content of from about 3.5% to about 8% by weight. Suitable methods of producing a coffee extract include, but are not limited to, extracting said concentrate from roasted and ground, caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee using a continuous flow column. Said columns are typically stainless steel vertical columns having a height-to-diameter ratio greater than or equal to 6:1 and a perforated top and bottom retainer to permit the transport of feed water while simultaneously keeping coffee granules between the retainers.

Coffee may be brewed both at home and commercially by various methods including dripped and percolated. Dripped coffee may be favored, especially in commercial settings, because of preferable flavor, ease of preparation, or other reasons. In the dripped method, ground coffee may be placed in a coffee filter and the filter placed in a coffee holder. In some coffee brewers, the coffee holder may be constructed to function as both the holder and filter. For example, the coffee holder may have a fine mesh sieve at the bottom that retains the ground coffee but permits passage of liquids. Hot water is released at a predetermined rate onto ground coffee and the coffee chemicals carried from the ground coffee by the hot water, which then seeps through the coffee filter and is directed into a coffee vessel for immediate use or storage for later use. The ground coffee may comprise a blend of two or more varieties of coffee beans. The coffee beans may be selected to provide a desired resultant brewed coffee having certain characteristics, for example, a balance of types of flavors and acidity. The strength of the brewed coffee may depend upon the length of time that the hot water is in contact with the ground coffee and the quantity of ground coffee available to provide the coffee flavoring chemicals. The rate at which water is released onto the ground coffee may be adjusted so that the hot water remains in the coffee holder long enough to brew the coffee before seeping through the filter and into the coffee vessel. The quantity of coffee in the holder may also be a factor in the length of time that the water remains in the holder. The holder flow-through rate and the water release rate are balanced so as to prepare a consistent strength of brewed coffee for a given amount of ground coffee. SUMMARY The present application describes systems and techniques relating to brewing coffee. In one aspect, brewing of coffee is facilitated by releasing water from at least one water inlet onto ground coffee in a stationary coffee filter. The ground coffee is automatically agitated while the water is being released using an agitator that is connected to an agitator motor. The agitation (or stirring) during the brewing process can promote flavor-enhancement of the coffee by helping to assure that the coffee grounds are uniformly mixed, saturated and blended with hot water. The agitation may substantially maintain an evenness of depth of the ground coffee, further aiding in the flavor-extraction process. The water extracts coffee chemicals and is collected after it has contacted the ground coffee. The release of water may be automatically stopped after a predetermined amount of water has been released onto the ground coffee. The automatic agitating of the ground coffee may be stopped a predetermined amount of time after the water has stopped being released. In another aspect, an apparatus includes a retention vessel to receive an aqueous liquid; a stationary ground coffee holder removably coupled to the retention vessel and having a bottom effective to retain ground coffee and permit passage of aqueous liquid; at least one water inlet to provide water to be released onto the ground coffee; an agitator motor; and a coffee agitator connected to the agitator motor effective to agitate the coffee grounds during the brewing process to aid flavor-enhancement of the brewed coffee by helping to assure that the coffee grounds are uniformly mixed, saturated and blended with hot water. Also, the agitation substantially maintains the evenness of the depth of the ground coffee when the agitator motor is operating. The apparatus may have a heating element in heating communication with the retention vessel. The heating element also may be arranged to heat water that is subsequently provided to the water inlets. Control elements may be included to control at least one of the (a) amount of water released, (b) the temperature of the released water or (c) the operation of the agitator motor. The coffee agitator may have protrusions to extend into the ground coffee when the apparatus is in operation. The protrusions may have a circular cross-sectional shape and may also be flared on the free end. The protrusions may have an elliptical cross-sectional shape. The systems and techniques described here may provide one or more of the following advantages. In some implementations, the method can provide for uniform wetting of the ground coffee during brewing to enhance flavor production in the brewed coffee. The device can stir the coffee grounds during brewing without substantially disturbing the evenness of depth of the ground coffee in the coffee holder. A consistent brew of coffee may be achieved helping to assure that the water released onto the ground coffee contacts the ground coffee for a consistent amount of time to extract coffee chemicals before being collected. Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features and advantages may be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

A coffee maker includes an agitator to stir coffee grounds as water passes through the grounds. A motor is coupled to the agitator to move the agitator when water is released onto the coffee grounds. When in operation, the coffee grounds are in a stationary coffee holder below the agitator, which allows the aqueous liquid to pass through the holder and collect in a retention vessel. FIG. 1 illustrates an implementation of a coffee brewer 100 having a stationary ground coffee holder 102 and a coffee agitator 104 . The coffee holder 102 may be arranged as a filter to retain ground coffee 110 (shown as dots) and allow an aqueous liquid to pass through at least the bottom of the holder. In another implementation, the ground coffee holder may have one or more holes in the bottom. In this case, the ground coffee may be in a filter (not shown) within the ground coffee holder 102 that permits an aqueous liquid to pass through the filter into the ground coffee holder and then through the holes in the holder. The filter may be permanent, disposable or reusable. An agitator drive shaft 106 couples the coffee agitator 104 to an agitator motor 108 . In an implementation, a bushing 114 may be used to provide a bearing surface for the agitator drive shaft 106 . In some implementations, the bushing may be of a synthetic material or any other suitable material. The bushing may be made of, or coated with, a self-lubricating material. In implementations where the shaft is sealed, a lubricating port may be provided to enable lubrication of the shaft 106 without permitting the lubricant to contaminate the ground coffee. At least one inlet port 112 can be arranged to allow a fluid to be released onto the ground coffee. In an implementation, two or more inlet ports may be used. One or more valves (not shown) may be provided to enable or inhibit the release of fluid onto the ground coffee. A retention vessel 116 may be fitted with a support 118 to support the ground coffee holder 102 in the retention vessel. In an implementation, the coffee holder 102 is removably connected to the support 118 . The coffee holder also may be arranged to act as a filter that retains the ground coffee but allows fluid to pass through. The retention vessel 116 may be situated to receive the aqueous liquid after the liquid has contacted the ground coffee. In some implementations, a discharge spout 120 may be coupled to the retention vessel 116 . The discharge spout can be used to dispense the aqueous liquid from the retention vessel 116 . A discharge valve 122 may be provided to enable or inhibit the flow of the aqueous liquid through the discharge spout 120 . A heating element 124 may be in heating communication with the retention vessel 116 . The heat from the heating element also may be used to heat a liquid that may be supplied through piping (not shown) to the inlet ports 112 . Hot water may be released from the inlet ports 112 onto the ground coffee 110 that is put in the fixed ground coffee retainer 102 . In an implementation, the hot water supplied to the inlet ports 112 may be maintained at a temperature typically between about 180 and about 205 degrees Fahrenheit (82 and 96 degrees Celsius), preferably at approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) measured at the outlet of the inlet port 112 . The hot water may pass through the ground coffee and the coffee holder 102 and collect in the retention vessel 116 . While the water is being released from the inlet ports 112 , the agitator motor 108 may be activated to cause the coffee agitator 104 to rotate. The coffee agitator 104 may be arranged so that, when used, it helps to maintain the evenness of the ground coffee depth. Maintaining the evenness of depth of the ground coffee may help to provide consistency of the resultant brewed coffee by tending to cause the hot water to steep in the ground coffee for a consistent amount of time. That is, the hot water may steep longer in the ground coffee if the water is released onto an area where the depth of the ground coffee is deeper than in an area where the depth of the ground coffee is shallower. Such disparities could result when the ground coffee accumulates, or piles up, in front of a moving coffee agitator. The coffee agitator is located above the bottom of the coffee holder and is arranged so that the protrusions extend downwardly below the surface of the ground coffee when ground coffee is in the coffee holder. In one implementation, the motor may be controlled so as to rotate the coffee agitator in both a clockwise and a counter-clockwise direction. By rotating the coffee agitator in both directions, accumulation of the ground coffee 110 ahead of the agitator may be lessened. The rotational speed of the motor also may be adjusted to help reduce the accumulation, or piling up, of ground coffee ahead of the coffee agitator. Ground coffee is often a blend of a variety of coffee beans. The particular beans selected may be chosen to achieve a desired combination of, for example, flavors, strength and acidity. The consistency of the resultant brewed coffee may depend on extracting the coffee flavors in the proportions desired. It is advantageous to assure that the grounds of all the selected beans are wetted equally and uniformly, for example, by forming a slurry. As the released water seeps through the ground coffee and the water level in the ground coffee holder decreases, some of the grounds may be above the surface of the water and not providing their flavor to the brew. Also, some of the wet grounds may tend to sink to the bottom of the coffee/water slurry. The coffee agitator, when in use, may be arranged to help evenly and uniformly distribute the various ground coffee varieties in the coffee slurry. In one implementation, the coffee agitator may be arranged to have protrusions or other surface features that stir the ground coffee without disproportionately affecting the ground coffee depth. FIGS. 2-6 illustrate examples of coffee agitators. FIG. 2A illustrates a coffee agitator 202 having substantially cylindrical protrusions 204 that depend from a coffee agitator support surface 206 . FIG. 2B view A-A illustrates the substantially circular cross-sectional shape of the protrusions 204 . The length of the protrusions 204 may be selected to extend into the ground coffee in the coffee holder. The protrusions 204 may have a number and arrangement so as to stir the ground coffee without substantially disturbing the depth of the ground coffee. FIG. 3A illustrates a coffee agitator 300 having stirring protrusions 310 of a substantially elliptical shape. FIG. 3B view B-B illustrates the substantially elliptical cross-sectional shape having a central axis 320 of the protrusions 310 . Again, the number and arrangement of the protrusions may be such to stir the ground coffee without substantially disturbing the depth of the ground coffee. The protrusions may be positioned at an angle on the agitator to achieve different degrees of agitation. FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of the agitator of FIG. 3B-B where the elliptical protrusions 310 are rotated about the central axis 320 of the elliptical protrusions. The rotation can result in a variation in agitation of the ground coffee as the coffee agitator is rotated because a different projected surface area is presented to the ground coffee. FIG. 5A illustrates a coffee agitator 500 having protrusions 514 , which have a profile that may tend to stir the ground coffee so as to bring grounds from the bottom of the coffee towards the top. FIG. 5B view C-C illustrates the substantially circular cross-sectional shape of the protrusions 514 , which are flared on a bottom end 518 . The protrusions 514 are wider at the bottom end 518 than at the fixed end 516 so as to cause the ground coffee at the bottom of the coffee holder to be stirred upwards. FIG. 7 illustrates a coffee agitator 600 having protrusions 604 of varying lengths so as to generally conform to a shape of a coffee holder 702 . The differing lengths can provide for agitation of the coffee grounds 110 close to the sidewalls 704 of the coffee holder. In the example illustrated, the coffee holder 702 has sidewalls 704 that are inclined with respect to the coffee holder bottom 706 . The inclined sidewalls 704 can help prevent the coffee grounds from sticking to the sidewalls as the water level in the coffee holder decreases. FIGS. 6A-6B illustrate an implementation of the coffee agitator 600 of FIG. 7. Protrusions 604 may be attached to a protrusion support 602 . In an implementation, the support can be a bar. Other shapes may be used. The protrusions 604 may be attached at an angle θ to an x-axis of an orthogonal x-y axis in the plane of agitator rotation. The angle θ is selected to agitate the coffee grounds in both the x and y directions and, in one implementation, is 15 degrees. The protrusions 604 a - 604 n can be of any suitable number and of varying lengths generally to follow the shape of the coffee holder. The ends 606 of the protrusions may be shaped including tapered, flat and pointed. Referring again to FIG. 1, after the water progresses through the ground coffee, the liquid may pass through the ground coffee holder 102 and collect in the retention vessel 116 . In an implementation, the collected liquid may be dispensed through the discharge spout 120 . Liquid remaining in the retention vessel 116 may be kept at a predetermined temperature by the heating element 124 . In an implementation, liquid may be circulated in piping (not shown) around the heating element so as to heat the liquid. Subsequently, the heated liquid may be provided to the inlet ports 112 . In an implementation, control circuitry 126 may be used to vary operation of the coffee brewer. For example, the control circuitry may be coupled to the agitator motor 108 to limit the operation of the agitator motor and, hence, the coffee agitator 104 . For example, the control circuitry may provide that the agitator motor continue to operate for a predetermined time after the liquid has ceased to be released from the inlet ports 112 . Thus, the ground coffee 110 continues to be agitated while some part of the liquid remains in the ground coffee holder 102 . The control circuitry also may be coupled to the inlet port 112 to limit the amount of water released onto the ground coffee or control the temperature of the released water. FIG. 8 is a flow chart 800 of an implementation of a method for making stir-brewed coffee. Hot water may be released 802 from water inlets onto ground coffee. The inlets may be arranged to evenly distribute the water onto the ground coffee. The hot water may be heated externally or heated by a heating element that also can serve to heat the brewed coffee. The hot water can seep through the ground coffee and extract the coffee chemicals while in contact with the ground coffee to provide stir-brewed coffee. The amount of water in contact with the ground coffee may depend upon at least the rate of water release and the flow-through rate through the ground coffee. The water and ground coffee can create a slurry that may be agitated 804 . Agitation of the slurry may help to assure a uniformity of the mixture of various varieties of coffee (for example, beans, crops, roasts, and so on) that make up the ground coffee so that each variety contributes in desired proportion to the resultant brewed coffee. The agitation of the slurry can be implemented so as to involve the coffee varieties in the desired proportions. The agitation of the coffee grounds also may be implemented so that substantially all of the water that is released onto the grounds remains in the slurry for substantially the same amount of time and, thus, extracts substantially the same amount of coffee chemicals. The brewed coffee may be collected 806 in a suitable vessel after the added water seeps through the ground coffee. Other embodiments may be within the scope of the following claims.","20050008744"

BACKGROUND ART In general, in order to improve an extraction rate of coffee component included in the roasted coffee beans (which herein includes: a flavor component providing elements of taste, aroma, and color specific to coffee; a richness component providing elements of richness and thickness of coffee; and the like), a water vapor treatment is performed in which the roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with water vapor. However, this treatment increases an acidity of the roasted coffee beans, and thus it is likely that an excessive acidity is added to a coffee beverage obtained through an extraction from the roasted coffee beans. Accordingly, as described in Patent Document 1, there had been proposed a method for treating roasted coffee beans in which generation of acidity in the roasted coffee beans can be suppressed, even when the water vapor treatment is performed on the roasted coffee beans for the purpose of improving the extraction rate of the coffee component. Patent Document 1: International Publication WO2005/011396 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to the treatment method described in Patent Document 1, it is possible to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component while suppressing the generation of acidity in the roasted coffee beans. However, the method does not necessarily promote a satisfactory increase in the content of richness component (which herein means a component that provides elements of richness and thickness of coffee, and examples include oligosaccharide and succinic acid) in the roasted coffee beans (for example, in the case of the roasted coffee beans of Coffea robusta or the like, the method does not satisfactorily increase the content of richness component). It should be noted that, with respect to trials to increase the richness component content of the roasted coffee beans, there have been made various studies (e.g., elaborating the roasting method) for increasing the richness component content in the roasted coffee beans that have not so high commercial values due to their low richness component content (e.g., C. robusta ), but no satisfactory effect has been obtained to this date. The present invention was made with the view towards overcoming the above-mentioned disadvantages, and the purpose is to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component from the roasted coffee beans while suppressing the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans, and to increase the richness component content in the roasted coffee beans. In a first aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the method includes: a sugar-enriching treatment step in which roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with sugar to increase a sugar content of the roasted coffee beans; and a water vapor treatment step in which the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are brought into contact with water vapor. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, as shown in Examples 3-8 which will be described later, it becomes possible to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component from the roasted coffee beans while suppressing the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans. In addition, as will be described later in Examples 3-8, in the roasted coffee beans treated according to the present invention, it is possible to remarkably increase a content of succinic acid (one of richness component) which is taken as richness index in rice wine or the like. Therefore, according to the present invention, the richness component content in the roasted coffee beans can be increased. It should be noted that it is the present inventors' intensive and extensive studies that led for the first time to the finding of the above-described fact, i.e., the above-described effects can be obtained by combining the sugar-enriching treatment step in which roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with sugar to increase a sugar content of the roasted coffee beans, and the water vapor treatment step in which the roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with water vapor. In a second aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the roasted coffee beans are roasted whole beans. [Action and Effect] According to the invention, the roasted coffee beans are roasted whole beans, and thus in water vapor treatment step the drainage of the flavor component and the richness component of coffee can be suppressed low, leading to enhancement of use efficiency of the roasted coffee beans as raw material. In a third aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the sugar is selected from the group consisting of sucrose, glucose and maltose. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, sucrose, glucose, and maltose which are industrially available at low cost are used, and thus the richness component can be effectively given to the roasted coffee beans, such as C. robusta. In a fourth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the sugar-enriching treatment comprises a treatment of bringing the roasted coffee beans into contact with a sugar solution. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the roasted coffee beans are brought into contact with the sugar solution, and thus the sugar component can be efficiently transferred into the roasted coffee beans through the medium. In a fifth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the sugar solution is an aqueous solution. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, water, which has a high solubility of sugar, is used as medium, and thus a sugar solution of a high concentration can be prepared, leading to efficient transfer of the sugar component into the roasted coffee beans. In a sixth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the roasted coffee beans are those of Coffea robusta. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the richness component content of the C. robusta can be remarkably increased, leading to enhancement of commercial value of C. robusta. In a seventh aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, in the water vapor treatment step, the water vapor is brought into contact in a ventilated state. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the contents of formic acid and acetic acid in the roasted coffee beans can be reduced, leading to secure suppression of the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans. In an eighth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, in the water vapor treatment step, the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are placed in a processing tank equipped with a water vapor supply pathway and a water vapor effluent pathway, and the water vapor is passed from the water vapor supply pathway to the water vapor effluent pathway so as to be discharged from the water vapor effluent pathway at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, by performing the water vapor treatment in a ventilated state, it becomes possible to eliminate formic acid and acetic acid generated by a pyrolysis reaction from the system, and thus the acidity of the treated roasted coffee beans is expected to be reduced. In a ninth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, in the water vapor treatment step, the water vapor is brought into contact in a sealed state. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the water vapor treatment is performed in a sealed state, and thus the richness component can be given without draining the aroma component from the roasted coffee beans. In a tenth aspect of the method for treating roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, the water vapor is saturated water vapor whose temperature is 100° C.-230° C. [Action and Effect] According to the present invention, the water vapor temperature is set to 100° C.-230° C., and thus the richness component, such as succinic acid, can be produced efficiently. In a first aspect of the roasted coffee bean according to the present invention, the roasted coffee bean is treated by the above-mentioned method for treating roasted coffee beans. [Action and Effect] The roasted coffee beans of the present invention have a very high commercial value, with a high extraction rate of the coffee component, a low acidity, and a high content of the richness component. In a second aspect of the roasted coffee beans according to the present invention, a succinic acid content is 0.69 mg/g or more. [Action and Effect] The roasted coffee beans of the present invention have a very high commercial value, with a high content of succinic acid as richness component. In an aspect of the coffee beverage according to the present invention, it is made from the above-mentioned roasted coffee beans. [Action and Effect] The coffee beverage of the present invention has an excellent flavor with a low acidity but with deep richness and thickness. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The embodiments of the present invention will be described below. Embodiments Prior to describing the method for treating roasted coffee beans of the present invention, the roasted coffee beans and sugar used in the present invention will be described first. (Roasted Coffee Beans) There is no limitation with respect to the type of the roasted coffee beans to be used in the present invention, and examples include Coffea arabica, Coffea robusta , and Coffea liberica . It should be noted that, since the present invention is especially effective for roasted coffee beans having a small sugar content, C. robusta , such as vietnam and conilon, are preferably used. In addition, in order to prevent the coffee components (such as flavor component and richness component of coffee) from draining, which may otherwise be caused by a continuous water vapor treatment, it is desired that the roasted coffee beans is in whole bean form or coarsely ground. (Sugar) There is no limitation with respect to the sugar to be used in the present invention, but preferable examples include: monosaccharide, such as glucose, galactose, and fructose; and disaccharide, such as sucrose, maltose, lactose, and cellobiose. It is more preferable to use sucrose contained especially in natural coffee beans. Next, the method for treating roasted coffee beans of the present invention will be described below. The method for treating roasted coffee beans of the present invention includes at least (1) sugar-enriching treatment step and (2) water vapor treatment step, which will be described below. Steps other than these (e.g., a step in which the roasted coffee beans are washed with water and dried after the sugar-enriching treatment step) may be added when desired. (1) Sugar-Enriching Treatment Step The sugar-enriching treatment step is performed in which the roasted coffee beans and the sugar are brought into contact with each other to increase the sugar content of the roasted coffee beans. There is no limitation with respect to the method for bringing the roasted coffee beans into contact with the sugar, and for example, a sugar solution prepared by dissolving sugar in a solvent, such as water, to a predetermined concentration may be brought into contact with the roasted coffee beans in an appropriate manner. The sugar concentration of the sugar solution to be used is arbitrarily selected. However, in the case of a sugar solution of a low concentration, the coffee components are likely to be transferred to the solvent when a long-term contact is necessary, and thus it is preferable that the sugar concentration is at a level or higher that can prevent the transfer of the coffee components. On the other hand, in the case where the sugar concentration is excessively high, an operability of the treatment becomes poor, for example, a removal of the excessive sugar attached to the surface of the roasted coffee beans becomes difficult. The range thereof is preferably 10 wt %-50 wt %, more preferably 20 wt %-40 wt %, still more preferably 25 wt %-35 wt %. Examples of the method for brining the sugar solution into contact with the roasted coffee beans include spraying, application and immersion. Among these, immersion for a predetermined period of time (e.g., approximately 1 hour) is preferable, since the immersion allows the sugar to efficiently penetrate into the roasted coffee beans. (2) Water Vapor Treatment Step Next, the water vapor treatment is performed in which the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment and water vapor are brought into contact with each other. The present step can be performed, for example, by a non-ventilated (batch-wise) water vapor treatment in which the above-described roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are placed in a sealable pressure vessel, water vapor is supplied, and predetermined temperature and pressure are retained for a predetermined period of time. However, it is preferable that the present step be performed by a continuous water vapor treatment in which, for example, in the water vapor treatment step, the roasted coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment are placed in a processing tank equipped with a water vapor supply pathway and a water vapor effluent pathway, and the water vapor is passed from the water vapor supply pathway to the water vapor effluent pathway so as to be discharged from the water vapor effluent pathway at a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure. This is because, in the continuous water vapor treatment, by supplying the water vapor in a ventilated state, it becomes possible to eliminate formic acid and acetic acid generated by a pyrolysis reaction from the system, and thus the acidity in the roasted coffee beans is expected to be reduced. There is no limitation with respect to the type of the water vapor to be used in the present step, and examples include saturated water vapor, superheated steam, and supersaturated water vapor. It is preferable that a quality of the water vapor is that of pure steam, which is vapor generated from pure water. However, the quality is not limited as long as water can be used for treating foods, and if desired, vapor may be generated from a mixture of water and an appropriate amount of alcohol added thereto. It should be noted that the water vapor should not have extremely high temperature or high pressure, in order to retain increment of succinic acid, to suppress generation of formic acid and acetic acid, and to suppress carbonization of coffee beans. Specifically, it is desirable that the treatment be performed at a temperature of 100° C.-230° C. For attaining this temperature condition, the pressure range is generally set to 0.1 MPa-1.7 MPa, through the temperature range varies depending on the type of water vapor. It is more preferable that the temperature range is approximately 165° C.-205° C., in which the extraction efficiency of the coffee component by the hydrothermal reaction treatment is enhanced. In order to attain this temperature condition, in the case of saturated water vapor, the pressure range is set to 0.7 MPa-1.3 MPa. It is further more preferable that the temperature range be 165° C.-190° C., in which the generation of acidity is suppressed. For attaining this temperature condition, in the case of saturated water vapor, the pressure range is set to 0.7 MPa-0.9 MPa. It should be noted that the term “pressure” herein means “gauge pressure” which is a pressure when the atmospheric pressure is 0. Accordingly, for example, when the “gauge pressure 0.1 MPa” is converted into absolute pressure, it is a pressure with a value of atmospheric pressure plus 0.1 MPa. With the use of the technique of the present invention, the succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans can be remarkably increased. For example, there can be obtained roasted coffee beans having the succinic acid content of 0.69 mg/g-2.5 mg/g, or 0.8 mg/g-2.0 mg/g or more. According to the present invention, as will be described later in Examples, it becomes possible to improve the extraction rate of the coffee component from the roasted coffee beans while suppressing the acidity generation in the roasted coffee beans, and to increase the richness component content. Especially, by applying the present invention to the roasted coffee beans of C. robusta or the like that has less richness component and not so high commercial value, the commercial value thereof can be enhanced. It should be noted that the roasted coffee beans treated according to the present invention can be used as one of coffee materials for coffee beverage, together with other roasted coffee beans (regular coffee beans), instant coffee, and liquid coffee extract, and that such a coffee beverage can be produced in a coffee beverage manufacturing plant by a common method. For example, in a case of production process of coffee beverage cans, the coffee beverage can be produced by performing steps of “grinding (regular coffee beans and the roasted coffee beans)”, “extraction”, “blending”, “filtration”, “filling”, “seaming”, “sterilization”, “cooling”, and “box packing”. Alternatively, instant coffee, liquid coffee extract or the like may be prepared from the roasted coffee beans treated according to the present invention. EXAMPLES Hereinbelow, the present invention will be specifically described by referring to Examples, but the present invention is not limited to Examples. Example 1 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. arabica Water vapor treatment step: continuous water vapor treatment (treatment conditions: temperature=175° C., 190° C., 200° C.; time period=4 minutes) For the roasted coffee beans, those having a high degree of roast (L value=18, C. arabica ) in whole bean form were used. In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed 2.0 kg of roasted coffee beans and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor at a low pressure of 0.2 MPa (120° C.) was passed from the vapor inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. Three different treatment temperatures were used as standards (first treatment temperature: 175° C., second treatment temperature: 190° C., and third treatment temperature: 200° C.), and for each temperature, a water vapor treatment was performed for 4 minutes and then vacuum drying was performed. As a result, three different water vapor treated roasted coffee beans for these treatment temperatures were obtained (sample 1 (175° C.), sample 2 (190° C.), and sample 3 (200° C.)). With respect to each of the samples 1-3 and untreated roasted coffee beans, the coffee beans were ground (medium grinding), 10 g of the ground coffee was added to 100 mL of water retained at 90° C. under atmospheric pressure, an extraction was performed for 20 minutes, and paper filtration was performed to thereby obtain an extract. These extracts were evaluated in terms of pH, acid degree, content of dissolved solid (Brix) including the coffee components, and extraction rate. For the measurement of pH, a type F23pH meter (manufactured by HORIBA, Ltd.) was used. For the measurement of the acid degree, a titration acidity was measured using CAM500 (manufactured by Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) by a method based on JAS, and a value was expressed as an amount (relative value) of 0.1N NaOH required for titrating the extract up to pH7. For the measurement of Brix, RX-5000α (Atago Co., Ltd) was used, to whose measurement plate was dropwise added approximately 0.5 mL of the extract. The extraction rate was calculated based on the amount of the collected extract liquid (A), Brix (B), and the weight of the ground coffee beans (C), using the following equation: Extraction rate (%)= A (g)× B (%)/ C (g). A sensory evaluation was also performed, and with respect to each of the samples, the coffee beans were ground, 10 g of the ground coffee was put in a test glass, and 150 mL of boiled water was poured into the test glass to thereby obtain an extraction. First, a presence of off-flavor was checked while the coffee in the test glass was stirred well, and subsequently, tasting was performed with the coffee at an appropriate temperature (approximately 60° C.). There were six graders who performed the sensory evaluation (checking the presence of richness/thickness, acidity, and off-flavor). In the sensory evaluation, the richness/thickness was evaluated using a four-grade scale (1, 2, 3 and 4 points), in which a larger number means stronger and a smaller number means weaker. The acidity was evaluated using a four-grade scale, in which a larger number means weaker and a smaller number means stronger. An average of points given by the six trained graders was taken, and the scores of 3 points or more was marked as “O”, the score of 2-point range was marked as “Δ”, and the score of 1-point range was marked as “X”. The results are shown in Table 1 below. As compared with the untreated beans, the water vapor treated beans (samples 1-3) had a notably high extraction rate, while in terms of the treatment temperature, not so large difference was observed. With respect to the acidity, a sample (sample 3) was stronger than untreated beans, but the acidity can be suppressed to some degree when treated at 200° C. or lower. It should be noted that, with respect to all of the samples, the presence of the off-flavor was not sensed. Hereinafter, the water vapor treatment was performed at 190° C., since the excellent result was obtained in the sensory test. TABLE 1 Untreated Sample 1 Sample 2 Sample 1 beans (175° C.) (190° C.)

The test was performed on the roasted coffee beans of C. arabica , and roasted coffee beans of two types of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam). For the sugar-enriching treatment step, 100 g of each of the roasted coffee beans was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. From each of the treated coffee beans, an extract was prepared (in Table 2, these extracts are referred to as “sample with sugar-enriching treatment”), and the sucrose concentration in the extract was measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). For the measurement, the areas of the peak were measured using aqueous solutions of sucrose of 10 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm to obtain a calibration curve. In a profile of each sample, an area of the peak for the same retention time as that of sucrose was obtained, to thereby calculate the concentration. It should be noted that, with respect to each of the above-described roasted coffee beans, roasted coffee beans on which the sugar-enriching treatment step was not performed were prepared, and the sucrose concentration was measured in the same manner (in Table 2, these extracts are referred to as “untreated sample”). The results are shown in Table 2. Since the sucrose concentration in the sample with sugar-enriching treatment was increased more as compared with the sucrose concentration in the untreated sample, it is considered that the sucrose content of the roasted coffee beans was increased in all samples by the sucrose immersion treatment, and a remarkable increase was observed especially in C. robusta . This result shows that the method can increase the sucrose content of the roasted coffee beans. TABLE 2 Sucrose concentration (ppm) Sample with sugar-enriching Untreated sample treatment C. arabica 92.9 98.1 C. robusta (conilon) 24.2 61.8 C. robusta (vietnam) 18.9 66.3 Example 3 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. robusta Sugar-enriching treatment step: immersing the roasted coffee beans in a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose Water vapor treatment step: continuous water vapor treatment (treatment conditions: temperature=190° C.; time period=4 minutes) With respect to C. robusta beans having the sucrose content increased by the sugar-enriching treatment, it was examined how a succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans changes when a water vapor treatment step (190° C.) is performed. The test was performed using the roasted coffee beans of two types of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam). For the sugar-enriching treatment step, 100 g of each of the roasted coffee beans was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose (prepared by dissolving 300 g of JIS special grade reagent (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) into 1,000 mL of ion-exchange water) at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to the coffee beans having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed. In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed 2.0 kg of roasted coffee beans and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor (190° C., 0.9 MPa) was passed from the inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. From each type of the obtained roasted coffee beans, an extract was prepared (in Table 3, these extracts are referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”). In addition, the roasted coffee beans of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam) on which only the water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained from each type (in Table 3, these extracts are referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment”). Moreover, the roasted coffee beans of two types of C. robusta on which neither the sugar-enriching treatment step nor the water vapor treatment step was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained from each type (in Table 3, these extracts are referred to as “untreated sample”). Each extract as obtained above was subjected to filtration, and the succinic acid concentration was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). For the measurement, a single point calibration was performed using 200 ppm of a succinic acid standard solution, and the concentration was calculated based on peak areas for the same retention time. In addition, the succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans was calculated using the following equation: Succinic acid content in 1 g of roasted coffee beans=Succinic acid concentration (ppm)×Extract amount (L)/Weight (g) of roasted coffee beans The results are shown in Table 3 below. It was confirmed that the succinic acid content was remarkably increased by performing the water vapor treatment after the sucrose immersion treatment. This result shows that the method can remarkably increase the succinic acid content by performing the water vapor treatment on the roasted coffee beans whose sucrose content has been increased. TABLE 3 Succinic acid content (mg/g) Sample with water Untreated Sample with water vapor treatment + sample vapor treatment Sugar-enriching treatment Conilon 0.60 1.00 1.54 Vietnam 0.61 0.95 1.35 Next, with respect to the above-described two types of C. robusta (conilon and vietnam), sensory evaluation tests were performed on the extracts of “sample with water vapor treatment”, and “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”. In the sensory evaluation of the extract, the richness/thickness was evaluated using a four-grade scale (1, 2, 3 and 4 points), in which a larger number means stronger and a smaller number means weaker. The acidity was evaluated using a four-grade scale, in which a larger number means weaker and a smaller number means stronger. An average of points given by the six trained graders was taken, and the scores of 3 points or more was marked as “O”, the score of 2-point range was marked as “Δ”, and the score of 1-point range was marked as “X”. With respect to the off-flavor, the presence or absence of the off-flavor was indicated. The results are shown in Table 4 below. In all samples, no off-flavor was present and the acidity was hardly increased, while in the case where the sugar-enriching treatment step and the water vapor treatment step were performed, enhancement of richness/thickness was observed.

In the same manner as in Example 2, for the sugar-enriching treatment step, 100 g of the roasted coffee beans of C. arabica was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose (prepared by dissolving 300 g of JIS special grade reagent (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) into 1,000 mL of ion-exchange water) at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to the roasted coffee beans of C. arabica having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed. In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed 2.0 kg of roasted coffee beans and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor (190° C., 0.9 MPa) was passed from the inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. From the obtained roasted coffee beans, an extract was prepared (in Table 5, the extract is referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”). In addition, the roasted coffee beans on which only the water vapor treatment step (190° C., 4 minutes) was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained therefrom (in Table 5, the extract is referred to as “sample with water vapor treatment”). Moreover, the roasted coffee beans on which neither the sugar-enriching treatment step nor water vapor treatment step was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained therefrom (in Table 5, the extract is referred to as “untreated sample”). Each extract as obtained above was subjected to filtration, and the succinic acid concentration was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography (manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation). For the measurement, a single point calibration was performed using 200 ppm of a succinic acid standard solution, and the concentration was calculated based on peak areas for the same retention time. Next, in the same manner as in Example 3, the succinic acid content of the roasted coffee beans was calculated. The results are shown in Table 5 below. It was confirmed that the succinic acid content was increased by performing the water vapor treatment after the sucrose immersion treatment. TABLE 5 Succinic acid content (mg/g) Sample with water Untreated Sample with water vapor treatment + sample vapor treatment sugar-enriching treatment C. arabica 0.60 1.69 1.73 Next, with respect to C. arabica , sensory evaluation tests were performed on the extracts of “sample with water vapor treatment”, and “sample with water vapor treatment+sugar-enriching treatment”. As the result of the sensory test, no off-flavor was present and the acidity was hardly increased, while enhancement of richness/thickness was observed. It was confirmed that by performing the sugar-enriching treatment step and the water vapor treatment step, the coffee has characteristic taste with a notable depth. Example 5 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. robusta (conilon, L value=23) Sugar-enriching treatment step: immersing the roasted coffee beans in a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose Water vapor treatment step: continuous water vapor treatment (treatment conditions; temperature=175° C., 190° C., 200° C., 230° C.; time period=4 minutes) As the roasted coffee beans, four samples (samples 4-7) each composed of 100 g of C. robusta (conilon, L value=23)) were prepared. For the sugar-enriching treatment step, each of the samples 4-7 was immersed in 500 mL of a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose (prepared by dissolving 300 g of JIS special grade reagent (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) into 1,000 mL of ion-exchange water) at room temperature for 1 hour, and then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to each of the samples 4-7 having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step was performed using a continuous water vapor treatment, with the treatment time period of 4 minutes and various treatment temperatures (sample 4: 175° C., sample 5: 190° C., sample 6: 200° C., and sample 7: 230° C.). In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed each samples 4-7 and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor was passed from the inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans. For each of the obtained samples 4-7, an extract was prepared. In addition, the roasted coffee beans ( C. robusta (conilon, L value=23)) on which neither the sugar-enriching treatment step nor the water vapor treatment step was performed were prepared, and an extract was obtained therefrom (in Table 6, the extract is referred to as “untreated sample”). With respect to each extract as obtained above, in the same manner as in Examples 1 and 3, pH, content of dissolved solid (Brix) including the coffee components, extraction rate, and succinic acid content were measured and sensory evaluation tests (richness/thickness, acidity, and off-flavor) were performed. The results are shown in Table 6 below.

The succinic acid content was higher in all of the samples 4-7 than that in the untreated sample, and it was confirmed that the succinic acid content was remarkably increased. No off-flavor was sensed in all of the samples 4-7 and untreated sample. The acidity in all of the samples 4-6 was at about the same level as that of the untreated sample, and thus the acidity was not practically increased, while the acidity in the sample 7 was slightly stronger than that in the untreated sample. The richness/thickness was stronger in all of the samples 4-7 than that in the untreated sample, and thus enhancement effect was recognized. Example 6 Conditions Roasted coffee beans: C. arabica Sugar-enriching treatment step: immersing the roasted coffee beans in an aqueous solution of sucrose (concentration of the aqueous solution of sucrose=10, 20, and 30 wt %) Water vapor treatment step: non-ventilated water vapor treatment (treatment temperature=100° C. and 120° C.) As the roasted coffee beans, four samples (samples 8-11) each composed of 100 g of C. arabica were prepared. For the sugar-enriching treatment step, the samples 8, 9, 10 and 11, respectively, were immersed in 30, 10, 20 and 30 wt % of aqueous solutions of sucrose each in an amount of 500 mL, at room temperature for 1 hour, then dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to each of the samples 8-11 having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step was performed using an autoclave for a non-ventilated (batch-wise) water vapor treatment, while using various treatment temperatures (sample 8: 100° C., samples 9-11: 120° C.). An extract was prepared from each of the resultant samples 8-11. The roasted coffee beans ( C. arabica ) on which neither the sugar-enriching treatment step nor the water vapor treatment step was performed were also prepared, and an extract was obtained therefrom (in Table 7, these extracts are referred to as “untreated sample”). With respect to each extract as obtained above, in the same manner as in Examples 1 and 3, pH, content of dissolved solid (Brix) including the coffee components, extraction rate, and succinic acid content were measured and sensory evaluation tests (richness/thickness, acidity, and off-flavor) were performed. The results are shown in Table 7 below.

The acidity in all of the samples 8-11 was at about the same level as that of the untreated sample, and the richness/thickness was stronger in all of the samples 8-11 than that in the untreated sample, and thus enhancement effect was recognized.

For the sugar-enriching treatment step, a 30 wt % aqueous solution of sucrose was applied to the sample 12, while sprayed on the sample 13. Afterwards, these samples were dried with hot air at 90° C. for 1 hour. With respect to each of the samples 12 and 13 having undergone the sugar-enriching treatment, a water vapor treatment step (treatment temperature: 190° C., 4 minutes) was performed using a continuous water vapor treatment. In a pressure vessel (coffee bean container) having a pressure resistance to 3.0 MPa equipped with vapor inlet piping and outlet piping was placed the sample 12 or 13 and a water vapor treatment was performed in which saturated water vapor was passed from the inlet piping at a flow rate of 210 kg/hr per kg of the roasted coffee beans.

Microwave coffee makers are known to the art. They are generally of the type in which the coffee making apparatus, containing coffee grounds and water in separate compartments, is placed in a microwave oven to heat the water. In the prior art microwave coffee makers, when the water is sufficiently heated, it is then released from its own compartment and allowed to drip through the coffee grounds into a pitcher. An example of such a microwave coffee maker is the Amana Radarange Microwave Oven Coffee Maker, as described in the instruction booklet that accompanies the product. This coffee maker includes a water reservoir having a thermally-controlled valve in the bottom. The reservoir is positioned above a filtering basket over a carafe. To make coffee, the desired amount of water is placed in the reservoir and a measured amount of coffee grounds is placed in the basket. The coffee maker is assembled with the reservoir placed above the basket on top of the carafe, the coffee maker is placed in a microwave oven, and the oven is turned on to heat the water. When the water is sufficiently heated, the thermally-controlled valve opens to allow the water to drip through the coffee grounds into the carafe below. The microwave oven is to be turned off when coffee begins to drip into the carafe. The teaching of the coffee brewing art prior to this present invention has been that for best results the temperature of the water contacting the coffee grounds should be below the boiling point and above about 185° F. (approx. 85° C.). For example, the ""Coffee Brewing Workshop Manual"" of the Coffee Brewing Center of the Pan-American Coffee Bureau (Publication No. 54) states that the water temperature should be 200° F. plus or minus 5° F. (approx. 93° C. plus/minus 3° C.). And Ernest E. Lockhardt, in ""Characteristics of Coffee Relating to Beverage Quality"" (Coffee Brewing Institute, May 1959) recommends water temperatures above 185° F. (approx. 85° C.). Both references state that lower water temperatures will result in poor extraction and thereby detract from the quality of the brewed coffee. As a consequence of this teaching, it has typically been an objective in the art of coffee maker design, including those coffee makers for use in microwave ovens, to allow only sufficiently heated water (i.e., above approximately  185° F. or 85° C.) to come into contact with the coffee grounds. Adherence to this objective has caused the prior art microwave coffee makers to suffer from certain disadvantages, however. One disadvantage is that the period of time required by these coffee makers to brew a pot of coffee is relatively lengthy, being approximately equal to the time it takes to heat the water to the desired temperature plus the time required for the water to drip through the coffee grounds. Another disadvantage is that these coffee makers must utilize some means, such as the temperature controlled valve described above, for controlling the release of water onto the coffee grounds so that it does not occur until the water has been sufficiently heated in the reservoir. This requirement increases the complexity of the prior art coffee makers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to improvements in microwave coffee making apparatus and methods, which improvements avoid the above-mentioned and other disadvantages of the prior art. According to the present invention, the flow of water onto the coffee grounds is initiated prior to or during application of water-heating microwave energy to the coffee maker. The microwave coffee making apparatus of the present invention includes a water reservoir with an aperture near the bottom thereof, a coffee grounds basket positioned to receive water from the water reservoir aperture, and a pitcher positioned to receive brewed coffee from the coffee grounds basket. A manually operated valve means is located adjacent the water reservoir aperture to control draining of the water reservoir into the coffee grounds basket. To make coffee in this microwave coffee making apparatus, the reservoir is filled with a desired amount of water and a measured amount of coffee grounds is placed in the coffee grounds basket. Flow of water from the reservoir to the coffee grounds basket is then initiated and microwave energy is applied to the coffee making apparatus to heat the water. It is anticipated that this invention can be used to prepare hot beverages of various types. The remainder of this specification will use coffee as an example but the invention is not limited to this use. In a preferred embodiment of the apparatus of this invention, the valve is normally closed, and is preferably mounted at the bottom of the reservoir. The valve of the preferred embodiment has a spring-actuated plunger rod for controlling the valve. The plunger rod is disposed such that it can be selectively manually operated, preferably by being pressed axially downwardly by a cover securely placed on top of the water reservoir. The operation of the plunger opens the valve and initiates the gradual draining of water from the water reservoir into the coffee grounds basket. The coffee maker is adapted for use in a microwave oven to heat the water. The valve is opened prior to or during the activation of the microwave oven with the coffee maker inserted therein, thereby initiating the flow of water onto the coffee grounds immediately before or substantially at the time of application of microwave energy to the coffee maker. As the flow of water onto the coffee grounds of the preferred embodiment is initiated substantially at the time that microwave energy is applied to the coffee maker to warm the water, the amount of time required to brew a pot of coffee is substantially reduced to about the time needed to drain the water from the reservoir through the coffee grounds and into the pitcher, which is designed to be about the time required to result in a finished brew of the desired temperature, such as between about 170° F. and about 190° F. (approx. 76° C. to 88° C.). The temperature of the water which comes into contact with the coffee grounds may, of course, vary over a substantially wider temperature range, such as for example between about 60° F. and about 212° F. (approx. 15° C. to 100° C.). Furthermore, because the valve utilized in the improved coffee maker embodying the present invention is a manually controlled valve, as opposed to an automatic valve such as a thermally-operated valve, the valve herein utilized can be made more simple, and therefore less expensive, resulting in lower cost for the improved coffee maker. The invention itself, together with further objects and attendant advantages, will be best understood by reference to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a preferred embodiment of an improved microwave coffee maker 10 of the present invention. The coffee maker 10 includes a coffee pitcher 11, a water reservoir 12, a coffee ground basket 13, and a valve 14 for draining the reservoir 12. The pitcher 11 is a molded shell having a substantially cylindrical pitcher side wall 19 with one end of the cylinder closed by a pitcher bottom wall 19a. The pitcher 11 has a handle 15 for holding the pot and a pour spout 16 for facilitating the pouring of coffee 17 from the pitcher 11, both molded integrally with the pitcher 11. For use as a measure, the pitcher 11 bears volume gradations (not shown) on the pitcher side wall 19. On the outer side of the pitcher bottom wall 19a, the pitcher 11 has three feet 25. The feet 25 are also molded integrally with the pitcher 11. They give stability to the pitcher 11 while it is standing on a surface, and they provide separation between the pitcher bottom surface 19a, which may be hot, and the surface on which the pitcher 11 is standing. The pitcher 11 further has a circumferential step 18 molded in the upper portion of the pitcher side wall 19. The circumferential step 18 separates the pitcher 11 into a wider upper portion 20 and a narrower lower portion 21. The water reservoir 12 is also a molded shell, having a substantially cylindrical reservoir side wall 22 with one end of the cylinder closed by a reservoir bottom wall 22a. The reservoir 12 is removably seated on the circumferential step 18 inside the pitcher upper portion 20. The reservoir 12 has a diameter smaller than that of the pitcher upper portion 20; thus a circular space 73 is formed between their walls. For seating upon the circumferential step 18, the reservoir bottom wall 22a has peripheral ledges 23, shown more clearly in FIG. 5: the peripheral ledges 23 extend beyond the reservoir side wall 22 and rest on the circumferential step 18. The reservoir side wall 22 has cup gradations 26 marked thereon for indicating the volume of water 66 of the reservoir 12 up to each gradation. The cup gradations 26 indicate the three, four and five coffee cup (of 5 fl. oz. (approx. 150 ml.) each) water level. Extending downwardly from the outer side of the reservoir bottom wall 22a is a holding ring 27 molded integral with the reservoir bottom wall 22a. The holding ring 27 serves to hold the basket 13 suspended from the reservoir 12 and for stably standing the reservoir 12 on a surface when the reservoir 12 is removed from the pitcher 11 and the basket 13 is disconnected. For the purpose of the holding basket 13 suspended therefrom, the holding ring 27 has ""L""-shaped holding notches 28 formed therein, as shown more clearly in FIG. 5. The valve 14 is centrally mounted in the bottom wall 22a of the reservoir 12. The function of the valve 14 is to regulate the outflow of water from the reservoir 12. As shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the reservoir bottom wall 22a defines a rod hole 48 within its center. The reservoir bottom wall 22a also defines three draining apertures 49 along a circle concentric with the rod hole 48, and furthermore, the reservoir bottom wall 22a defines spring retaining ribs 50 which form an interrupted circle concentric with the rod hole 48 and which surround the apertures 49 on the inside surface of the reservoir bottom wall 22a. For the preferred embodiment of the present invention, including a reservoir with a capacity of about 27.5 fl. oz. (approx. 800 ml.), the preferred diameter of each aperture 49 is between about 0.044 and 0.046 inches (approx. 1.1 to 1.2 mm.). The apertures are sized so that the water exiting the draining hole 33 into the pitcher 11 is at the desired temperature. On the outer side of reservoir bottom wall 22a, concentric with the rod hole 48 and extending laterally beyond the draining apertures 49, the reservoir bottom wall 22a defines a flat circular sealing ledge 54. A vertical plunger rod 51 extends slidingly through the rod hole 48. The rod end portion 52 which extends outwardly from the reservoir 12 through the rod hole 48 is threaded. Screwed onto the rod end portion 52 is a spreader plate 53. As shown by FIG. 4, the spreader plate 53 is a circular plate 55 which defines on its upper surface a peripheral lip 56, a centrally located ring 57, and radially disposed and symmetrically arranged quartets of dividing ribs 58 and channeling ribs 59. The dividing ribs 58 extend from the peripheral lip 56 to the centrally located ring 57, while and channeling ribs 59 extend from the peripheral lip 56 only part way toward the centrally located ring 57. Thus the dividing ribs 58 divide the spreader plate 55 into four equal drip basins 64. In each drip basin 64 the spreader plate 55 defines two dripping apertures 65, one on each side of the channeling rib 59. The centrally located ring 57 circumscribes a sealing surface 60. The centrally located ring 57 also has formed therein four symmetrically located channels 61, each one of which opens onto one of the four drip basins 64 opposite the dividing rib 59 to provide communication from the sealing surface 60 to the drip basins 64. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the plunger rod 51 defines a spring retaining ledge 63 along its length. A helical compression spring 62 extends from between the spring retaining ribs 50 on the bottom wall 22a of the reservoir 12 to the spring retaining ledge 63. The spring 62 abuts both the reservoir bottom wall 22a and the spring retaining ledge 63, urging the plunger rod 51 upwards, thereby pressing the sealing surface 60 of the spreader plate 53 against the sealing ledge 54 of the reservoir bottom wall 22a to cover draining apertures 49. Thus the valve 14 is normally closed, if the plunger rod 51 is not depressed. Applying downward axial pressure to the plunger rod 51 sufficient to overcome the force of the spring 62 causes the plunger rod 51 to move downwardly and to carry the spreader plate 53 with it, as shown by dotted lines in FIG. 2. This results in the separation of the sealing surface 60 from the sealing ledge 54 and allows the draining apertures 49 to drain water from the reservoir 12 onto the sealing surface 60. From the sealing surface 60 the water is directed by the channels 61 in substantially equal amounts to the drip basins 64. In each drip basin 64, the channeling rib 59 aids to divide the water between the two dripping apertures 65, and through the dripping apertures 65 the water drips into the basket 13 mounted below. The axial pressure necessary to open the valve 14 can be applied to the plunger rod 51 by means such as a cover 67, shown in FIG. 1. With the cover 67 removed, the plunger rod 51 extends slightly higher than the top of reservoir 12. The placing of the cover 67 firmly on top of the reservoir 12 depresses the plunger rod 51 and thus opens the valve 14. To keep the cover 67 in place and thereby continually apply pressure to the rod 51, there is provided in the preferred embodiment a locking mechanism comprised of at least two symmetrically spaced and outwardly extending tabs 69 defined by the outer periphery of the cover 67, and at least two ""L""-shaped brackets 68 defined by the upper edge of the pitcher 11. The brackets 68 are sized and positioned to receive and hold the tabs 69. The brackets 68 and the tabs 69 are brought into engagement by means of twisting the cover 67 relative to the pitcher 11 until the brackets 68 and the tabs 69 meet. To align and guide the cover 67 relative to the pitcher 11 during twisting, the lower surface of the cover 67 defines a guiding ring 71 extending downwardly therefrom. The guiding ring 71 is sized and shaped to fit slidingly into the circular space 73 formed by the reservoir side wall 22 and the pitcher side wall 19. A handle 70 is molded integrally with the top of the cover 67 for handling and twisting the cover 67. The coffee ground basket 13, like the pitcher 11 and the reservoir 12, is a molded shell having a substantially cylindrical basket side wall 29 with one end of the cylinder closed by a basket bottom wall 29a. The basket 13 lies below the reservoir 12 and is removably suspended therefrom. The side wall 29 of the basket 13 has along its upper portion a finger ring 30 which encircles the wall 29 and extends outwardly therefrom. The finger ring 30 is molded integrally with the basket side wall 29. The finger ring 30 defines outwardly extending fingers 31, shown more clearly in FIG. 5, which fingers are adapted to engage the ""L""-shaped holding notches 28 of the holding ring 27 of the reservoir 12, and thus to hold the basket 13 attached to the outer bottom of the reservoir 12. Formed along the periphery of the basket bottom wall 29a on the outside of the basket 13 are three legs 32 which serve to provide stability to the basket 13 when it is removed from the pitcher 11 and is standing on a surface, with or without the reservoir 12 still attached to the basket. The basket bottom wall 29a has a centrally located circular draining, or straining, hole 33 formed therein (See FIG. 5). The draining hole 33 serves the dual purpose of draining the coffee 17 from the basket 13 and of providing a recess for mounting the filter 24. Surrounding the draining hole 33 on the inside surface of the basket bottom wall 29a are inner and outer supporting ribs 34 and 35, respectively, which form both an inner and an outer broken concentric circle, around the draining hole 33 (See also FIG. 8). The inner and outer supporting ribs 34, 35 serve to keep the filter 24 suspended above the basket bottom 29a and thus to provide a collecting basin 74 through which the coffee 17 dripping through the filter 24 can flow to the draining hole 33. Defining the draining hole 33 in the outer side of the basket bottom wall 29a is a keeper ring 36 having an inwardly extending keeper lip 38 along its inner bottom periphery. The keeper ring 36 is shown in greater detail in FIG. 6. The keeper lip 38 serves to engage keeper 44 of the filter 24 to hold the filter 24 securely in place. The keeper ring 36 further defines a draining slot 47 to aid the drainage of coffee. The filter 24 is mounted inside the basket 13 for the purpose of preventing coffee grounds 37 from being carried by water passing therethrough into the pitcher 11. As shown in FIG. 5, the filter 24 comprises a carrier ring 40 connected to a central slug 41 by radially placed carrier ribs 42. The area inside the carrier ring 40 is covered by a fine screen 43 which the carrier ring 40 and the carrier ribs 42 support. The filter 24 is sized to cover the whole bottom of the basket 13. As shown in FIG. 6, the filter slug 41 has a slotted keeper 44 extending downwardly therefrom. The keeper 44 has two hook portions 45 which define a keeper slot 46 between them. Upon assembly of the coffee maker 10, the keeper 44 extends through the draining hole 33 of the basket 13 and its hook portions 45 engage the keeper lip 38 of the keeper ring 36 which surrounds the draining hole 33, as shown in FIG. 7, thus serving to hold the filter 24 securely in place inside the basket 13. The diameter of the upper portion of the keeper 44 is made smaller than the diameter of the draining hole 33: thus, as shown in FIG. 6, a passageway 75 exists in the draining hole 33 around the keeper 44 through which passageway coffee can flow out from the basket 13. Thus, when the valve 14 is opened, the water 66 travels the following path through the basket 13: through the coffee grounds 37 and the screen 43 of the filter 24 into the collecting basin 74 and therealong into the passageway 75 of the draining hole 33, out of the basket 13 through the slots 46 and 47, and into the pitcher 11. The coffee maker 10 has the capacity for brewing five cups of coffee (of 5 fl. oz. (approx. 150 ml.) each) at one time: the finished brew capacity of the pitcher 11, with the reservoir 12 and the basket 13 mounted therein, is 25 fl. oz. (approx. 750 ml.). The empty pitcher 11 has a capacity of 2.5 qts. (approx. 2.4 1.). The capacity of the reservoir 12 is 27.5 fl. oz. (approx. 0.8 1.). To use the coffee maker 10 to brew a pitcher of coffee, the following procedure is followed. This procedure is the preferred method of the present invention. The filter 24 is securely mounted inside the basket 13 by pushing the filter keeper 44 into the basket draining hole 33. For ease of cleaning and improvment in the clarity of brewed coffee, an optional paper filter may be placed on top of the filter 24. An amount of coffee grounds 37 corresponding to the number of cups of coffee desired is placed inside the basket 13. Tests indicate that from 1.5 to 2 level teaspoons of coffee grounds per cup (about 5 fl. oz. or 150 ml.) of coffee produce good coffee. Fewer grounds may be used to make weaker coffee, more grounds to make stronger coffee. The basket 13 with the grounds 37 therein is attached to the bottom of reservoir 12 by aligning the reservoir holding notches 28 with the basket fingers 31 and then twisting the basket 13 relative to the reservoir 12 to engage the fingers 31 with the holding notches 28. The reservoir 12 and the basket 13 are now positioned inside the pitcher 11 such that the reservoir peripheral ledges 23 seat on the pitcher circumferential step 18. The reservoir 12 is filled with tap water 66 up to the cup gradation 26 that indicates the number of cups of coffee desired. A microwave oven is preset for a predetermined time. Tests with the coffee maker 10 indicate that converting tap water with a temperature of 60° F. (approx.  15.5° C.) into finished brew with a desirable temperature of 170°-190° F. (approx. 76°-88° C.) in a microwave oven having 650 watts output will take approximately 5 mins. 45 secs. for three cups, 6 mins. 30 secs. for four cups, and 7 mins. 45 secs. for 5 cups of coffee. The cover 67 is positioned on top of the pitcher 11 and twisted into locked position such that the cover brackets 68 engage the pitcher tabs 69, thus initiating the outflow of the water 66 from the reservoir 12. The coffee maker 10 is placed inside the microwave oven, and the oven is turned on. When the oven turns off, the coffee maker 10 with the hot, freshly brewed coffee in the pitcher 11 is removed from the oven. All components of the coffee maker 10 of the preferred embodiment, with the exception of the spring 62 are molded of material which is substantially transparent to microwave radiation. In other words, the radiation passes through the material without heating it to any substantial degree. Numerous suitable materials are available from which all components except for the spring can be made, including but not limited to polysulfone, polycarbonate, polypropylene, and styrene copolymers. In the preferred embodiment the pitcher 11 is made from polysulfone; the cover 67, the water reservoir 12, the spreader plate 53 and the plunger rod 51 are made from polycarbonate or styrene copolymer; the coffee ground basket 13 and the filter 24 with the exception of the screen 43 are made from polypropylene. In the preferred embodiment, the screen 43 is polyester. Also, the valve spring 62 of the preferred embodiment is made of stainless steel. Because the coffee maker 10 itself absorbs substantially no microwave energy, the energy of the oven is used primarily to heat the water. The apparatus of the present invention therefore takes great advantage of a microwave oven's ability to quickly bring a fixed amount of water to a desired temperature. Locking of the cover 67 onto the pitcher 11 opens the valve 14 and initiates the flow of the water 66 onto the coffee grounds 37, as explained above. The water flow is thereby initiated immediately prior to the application of microwave energy to the coffee maker, and because the water outflow from the reservoir 12 is gradual and because the water begins to heat up immediately upon application of microwave energy to the coffee maker 10, the amount of unheated water that flows onto the coffee grounds 37 is small. Furthermore, test results indicate that even a thirty-second delay between securing the cover 67 and commencing application of microwave energy does not seem to vary the coffee flavor substantially. The microwave energy heats the water wherever it may be in the coffee maker 10. The unheated water is the first water to come into contact with the dry coffee grounds and therefore it will be substantally retained by the grounds 37 until they are fully soaked. This delay in the flow of water through the grounds 37 will generally be adequate to allow the microwave energy to heat the water while it is still in contact with the grounds, so that very little, if any, cold water will have passed over the grounds 37 into the pitcher 11 below. The microwave energy heats all of the water, but it heats small amounts of water faster than large amounts. Therefore, while the water in the reservoir 12 is gradually being preheated, the controlled, relatively small stream of water leaving the reservoir 12 through the valve 14 is heated quickly, so that the coffee grounds 37 have a steady stream of hot water passing through them. For this reason, it is not necessary to await the heating of all of the water in the reservoir 12 before initiating the flow of water onto the coffee grounds 37. The microwave energy also maintains the temperature of the brewed coffee 17 in the pitcher 11 while the remaining coffee is still in the process of being brewed. Of course, it should be understood that various changes and modifications to the preferred embodiment described above will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, the coffee maker is not limited in use to brewing coffee, but may also be used for heating water, making soups, or brewing hot tea or chocolate. In fact because the cover 67 rests directly on the pitcher 11, the combination of the cover 67 and the pitcher 11 can be used without the other inner portions of the coffee maker to heat or reheat foods in the microwave oven. Various other means, such as switches or twist knobs, may be utilized to open the valve. The reservoir and the basket may be adpated to rest on top of, instead of inside, the pitcher. Or the capacity of the coffee maker may be varied. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill, these and other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.","4381696"

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a coffee roaster, and more particularly, a fluidized electric coffee roaster, whereby heated air is supplied and discharged from a lower part of a fluidizing chamber to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber having a cylindrical structure in which raw coffee beans are injected. The raw coffee beans are circulated from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber and roasted, thereby enabling roasting that maximizes the characteristics of the raw coffee beans while keeping the raw coffee beans from burning. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In general, three factors that determine the flavor of coffee are first, the type and quality of raw coffee beans; second, the degree of roasting of coffee; and third, a roasting method. In particular, the roasting method and the uniform roasting degree of raw coffee beans caused by the roasting method play a decisive role in flavor. Specifically, coffee roasting refers to the process of making coffee beans by heat-treating raw coffee beans. Raw coffee beans do not have any taste or smell by themselves, but when the cell tissues of raw coffee beans are destroyed through the roasting process, various components (fat, sugar, acidity, caffeine, etc.) are activated and released to the outside. That is, because some components of raw coffee beans are strengthened and other components are weakened during the coffee roasting process, the taste and aroma of coffee beans may vary greatly depending on the roasting method. A coffee roasting method according to the related art includes an electric method of roasting raw coffee beans while supplying hot air to the raw coffee beans using electric energy. Another method known in the art includes a gas method of roasting raw coffee beans by directly heating a rotating drum containing raw coffee beans with a heat source using gas energy. Under the electric method and the gas method of roasting raw coffee beans according to the related art, as high temperature and dry heat are transferred to the raw coffee beans, moisture in the raw coffee beans evaporates, so that the raw coffee beans are roasted in a dried state. Moreover, roasting raw coffee beans under either of these conventional methods takes a lot of time and energy to reach the proper temperature such that the taste and flavor are deteriorated. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a fluidized electric coffee roaster, whereby heated air is supplied and discharged from a lower part of a fluidizing chamber to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber having a cylindrical structure in which raw coffee beans are injected. The raw coffee beans are then circulated (fluidized) from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber and roasted, thereby enabling roasting that maximizes the characteristics of the raw coffee beans while preventing the raw coffee beans from burning. In yet another embodiment, the present invention also provides a fluidized electric coffee roaster, whereby external air is sprayed into a lower part of a fluidizing chamber at a high speed so that the fluidity of raw coffee beans is maintained even when the raw coffee beans are heavy, thereby enabling fluidized roasting. In another embodiment, the present invention also provides a fluidized electric coffee roaster, whereby external air in which heated air discharged to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber is supplied to a lower part of the fluidizing chamber and preheated so that the electric energy of a heating unit can be saved.

The fluidized electric coffee roaster may further include a flow auxiliary unit that is configured to be connected from the air supply unit to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber and allows external air to be directly supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber and raw coffee beans, thereby flowing the raw coffee beans. The fluidized electric coffee roaster may further include a dust collecting unit connected to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber that collects foreign substance in exhaust air discharged to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber, and a heat exchanging unit communicating with the dust collecting unit and providing a discharge flow path through which the exhaust air from which the foreign substances discharged from the dust collecting unit are removed, is discharged to the outside, wherein the heat exchanging unit allows external air inside the housing to be heat-exchanged by residual heat of the air discharged through the discharge flow path and then supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber through the air supply unit. The fluidizing chamber may include a chamber body having a rectangular cylindrical shape; an inclined surface configured in such a way that one side of a lower end of the chamber body is inclined toward the other side of the lower end of the chamber body; an air inlet, which is opened at the lower end of the chamber body with a cross-sectional area of a smaller size than the cross-sectional area of the chamber body and into which heated air is introduced from the air supply unit; a raw coffee bean inlet, which is opened at the upper end of the chamber body and through which raw coffee beans are introduced into the chamber body from the raw coffee bean injecting unit; a stirring plate, which is formed in a position spaced apart from the other side of the chamber body and into which heated air is introduced through the air inlet so that, when the raw coffee beans injected into the vicinity of the inclined surface of the chamber body are fluidized, an agitation layer of the raw coffee beans stacked inside the lower end of the chamber body does not collapse; a diffusion slot, which is located in the air inlet and in which heated air flowing into the lower end of the chamber body through the air inlet is diffused into the interior of the chamber body and simultaneously straightness is maintained; an air outlet, which is opened at one side of the upper end of the chamber body and in which heated air introduced into the chamber body is discharged to the dust collecting unit; and a coffee outlet, which is formed to extend to an opening formed in the lower part of the inclined surface at a predetermined angle and through which coffee roasted in the chamber body is discharged to the outside. The flow auxiliary unit may include a booster pipe branching from a duct between the air supply fan of the air supply unit and the heating unit to the air inlet of the fluidizing chamber, and an on/off valve connected to the booster pipe and controlled.

As illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 9 , a fluidized electric coffee roaster according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a housing 110 having an upper chamber 111 and a lower chamber 112 , a fluidizing chamber 120 disposed in the upper chamber 111 and having a predetermined volume into which raw coffee beans are put, discharged and roasted, a heating unit 130 disposed in the lower chamber 112 and communicating with a lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 , an air supply unit 140 , which is located in the lower chamber 112 and configured to be connected to the heating unit 130 and in which, after external air inside the lower chamber 112 is heated through the heating unit 130 , heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and is discharged to an upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 . The air supply unit 140 is supplied with heated air to the lower part and discharged to the upper part, so that raw coffee beans are circulated from a lower part to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 and roasted. A flow auxiliary unit 150 is connected from the air supply unit 140 to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows external air inside the lower chamber 112 to be directly injected into the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 , such that when the raw coffee beans are heavy, it flows the raw coffee beans together with heated air. A dust collecting unit 160 , which is located in the upper chamber 111 , is configured to be connected to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and collects foreign substances in exhaust air discharged to the upper part of the fluting chamber 120 . A heat exchanging unit 170 , which is located in the lower chamber 112 , communicates with the dust collecting unit 160 , provides a discharge flow path through which the exhaust air from which the foreign substances discharged from the dust collecting unit 160 are removed, and is discharged to the outside of the lower chamber 112 to allow external air of the lower chamber 112 to be heat-exchanged by residual heat of the exhaust air so that when heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 through the air supply unit 140 , electric energy consumption of the heating unit 130 can be saved. A raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 , which is located outside the upper chamber 111 , is configured to be connected to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 to allow the raw coffee beans to be injected into the fluidizing chamber 120 from the outside. A coffee discharging unit 190 , which is disposed in the lower chamber 112 , is configured to be connected to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 so that roasted coffee can be discharged. As shown in FIG. 1 , the housing 110 that is a housing unit for providing an upper chamber 111 and a lower chamber 112 for the components to be installed, is configured such a way that frames of the upper chamber 111 and the lower chamber 112 are detachable by a cover panel so that installation and maintenance of the components is facilitated. In FIGS. 2 - 3 and 5 - 9 , it is shown that the fluidizing chamber 120 is a roasting chamber located in the upper chamber 111 that has a predetermined volume into which raw coffee beans are introduced, discharged, and roasted. The fluidizing chamber 120 includes a chamber body 121 having a rectangular cylindrical shape; an inclined surface 122 configured such a way that one side of a lower end of the chamber body 121 is inclined toward the other side of the lower end of the chamber body 121 ; an air inlet 123 , which is opened at the lower end of the chamber body 121 with a cross-sectional area of a smaller size than the cross-sectional area of the chamber body 121 and into which heated air is introduced from the air supply unit 140 ; a raw coffee bean inlet 124 , which is opened at the upper end of the chamber body 121 and through which raw coffee beans are injected into the chamber body 121 from the raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 ; a stirring plate 125 , which is formed in a position spaced apart from the other side, which is the opposite surface of the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 , into which heated air is introduced through the air inlet 123 so that, when the raw coffee beans injected into the vicinity of the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 are fluidized, an agitation layer of the raw coffee beans stacked inside the lower end of the chamber body 121 maintains an angle of repose that can be stabilized without collapsing to a predetermined height, thereby maximizing agitation and roasting effects; a diffusion slot 126 , which is located in the air inlet 123 and in which heated air flowing into the lower end of the chamber body 121 through the air inlet 123 is uniformly diffused into the interior of the chamber body 121 and simultaneously straightness is maintained, thereby uniformly fluidizing the raw coffee beans and maximizing stir-ability and roasting effects; an air outlet 127 , which is opened at one side of the upper end of the chamber body 121 and in which heated air introduced into the chamber body 121 is discharged to the dust collecting unit 160 ; and a coffee outlet 128 , which is formed to extend to an opening formed in the lower part of the inclined surface 122 at a predetermined angle and through which coffee roasted in the chamber body 121 is discharged to the outside. Here, the fluidizing chamber 120 enables the installation and configuration of the inclined surface 122 , the stirring plate 125 , and the diffusion slot 126 , etc., through the chamber body 121 having a rectangular cylindrical shape. Thus, it is not necessary to float the raw coffee beans as high as in a fluidized bed according to the related art, so that stir-ability can be improved using low air pressure and energy, and the diffusion of conductive heat between raw coffee beans is allowed, resulting in maximization of the roasting effects. On the other hand, preferably, the fluidizing chamber 120 further includes a penetration hole 129 , which is disposed at one side of the chamber body 121 and through which the roasting situation of the raw coffee beans can be observed with the naked eyes from the outside on one side of the chamber body 121 to visually observe the roasting state of raw coffee beans from the outside. In addition, as shown in FIGS. 7 - 9 , the fluidizing chamber 120 may further include an inclined plate 121 a for dropping, which allow the raw coffee beans to drop near the inclined surface 122 when the raw coffee beans are introduced from the raw coffee bean inlet 124 to the lower end of the chamber body 121 at the upper end of the chamber body 121 . After the raw coffee beans are concentrated near the inclined surface 122 by an inclined plate 121 a for dropping and the raw coffee beans on the opposite side of the inclined surface 122 are moved upward by the heated air flowing in through the air inlet 123 , the raw coffee beans are dropped into the inclined surface 122 in a higher position than the stirring plate 125 and thus, stir-ability can be enhanced. In addition, as shown in FIG. 8 , it is preferable that, in the fluidizing chamber 120 , a diffuser 121 b communicating with the heating unit 130 is configured at the air inlet 123 at the lower end of the chamber body 121 . Thus, according to the fluidizing chamber 120 , the inclined surface 122 is formed at the lower end of the chamber body 121 having the rectangular cylindrical body. A movement in which the raw coffee beans injected into the lower end of the inside of the chamber body 121 by the stirring plate 125 and the diffusion slot 126 configured in the air inlet 123 are moved upwards to a space between inner surfaces of the stirring plate 125 and the chamber body 121 from the lower end of the inclined surface 122 by heated air, and then dropped toward the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 again, is repeatedly made. Thus, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the raw coffee beans are roasted in a fluidized method, so that the raw coffee beans do not burn, and taste and aroma can be improved. Here, a distance from the other side of the chamber body 121 to the stirring plate 125 is preferably slightly greater than the diameter of the air inlet 123 in contact with the other side of the chamber body 121 . Thus, as the air introduced through the air inlet 123 having a small area spread toward the upper part of the chamber body 121 , the raw coffee beans are moved upward. In this case, the raw coffee beans moved to a higher position than the stirring plate 125 are repeatedly dropped to the inclined surface 122 , so that the raw coffee beans are more smoothly fluidized. In addition, preferably, the fluidizing chamber 120 is finished with a well-known insulating material in order to improve heat preservation. As illustrated in FIGS. 8 - 9 , the heating unit 130 is a unit configured in the lower chamber 112 that communicates with the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 so that the air introduced into the air inlet 123 is converted into heated air. Here, preferably, the heating unit 130 is finished with a known heat insulating material in order to improve heat preservation. As shown in FIG. 3 , the air supply unit 140 is located in the lower chamber 112 and is connected to the heating unit 130 . The air supply unit 140 is an air supply unit in which when external air inside the lower chamber 112 is heated by the heating unit 130 . The heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and is discharged to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 so that the raw coffee beans are circulated from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber 120 to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 and are roasted. The air supply unit 140 includes an air supply fan 141 for supplying external air inside the lower chamber 112 to the heating unit 130 communicating with the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 . Thus, according to the heating unit 130 and the air supply unit 140 , a unit for supplying air and a unit for heating the air are simply coupled to each other in a state in which each of the unit for supplying air and the unit for heating the air has a modular configuration, so that installation and maintenance can be facilitated. Here, preferably, a well-known noise suppresser for reducing driving noise is configured in the air supply fan 141 , and for example, it is preferable to reduce the driving noise of the air supply fan 141 to 70 dB or less. In FIG. 9 , the flow auxiliary unit 150 is shown as an auxiliary flow unit, which is configured to be connected from the air supply unit 140 to the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows the external air inside the lower chamber 112 to be directly sprayed to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 at a high speed so that when the raw coffee beans are heavy, the raw coffee beans flow together with the heated air. The flow auxiliary unit 150 includes a booster pipe 151 branching from a duct between the air supply fan 141 of the air supply unit 140 and the heating unit 130 to the air inlet 123 or the diffuser 121 b of the fluidizing chamber 120 , and an on/off valve 152 connected to the booster pipe 151 and electronically controlled. Therefore, according to the flow auxiliary unit 150 , when heated air through the heating unit 130 and the air supply unit 140 is introduced into the chamber body 121 , the raw coffee beans are heavy, and fluidizing of the raw coffee beans is not done well during fluidizing roasting of the raw coffee beans, selectively, the external air can be sprayed directly to the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the chamber body 121 at a high speed. Thus, the roasting effect of heavy raw coffee beans can be improved by the flow auxiliary unit 150 . In FIG. 2 , the dust collecting unit 160 is illustrated as a dust collecting unit, which is located in the upper chamber 111 , connected to the air outlet 127 of the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and which collects foreign substances in the exhaust air discharged to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 . The dust collecting unit 160 includes an air outlet pipe 161 communicating with the air outlet 127 of the chamber body 121 ; a dust collector 162 , which has a cylindrical structure and through which the air outlet pipe 161 is connected to the upper end of one side of the dust collector 162 and allows foreign substance having a high specific gravity to be dropped downwards when the exhaust air including the foreign substances is introduced; a foreign substance collector 163 , which communicates with the lower part of the dust collector 162 and in which foreign substances are collected; and an air moving pipe 164 , which extends from the upper end of the dust collector 162 to the heat exchanging unit 170 of the lower chamber 112 and allows only the exhaust air in which the foreign substances are dropped and removed from the dust collector 162 , to be moved to the heat exchanging unit 170 . As shown in FIG. 4 , the heat exchanging unit 170 is located in the lower chamber 112 , and communicates with the dust collecting unit 160 and provides a discharge flow path through which the exhaust air from which foreign substances discharged from the dust collecting unit 160 are removed is discharged to the outside of the lower chamber 112 . The heat exchanging unit 170 is a heat exchanging unit, which allows the external air of the lower chamber 112 to be heat-exchanged with the residual heat of the exhaust air, so that, when the heated air is supplied to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 through the air supply unit 140 , electrical energy consumption of the heating unit 130 can be saved. The heat exchanging unit 170 includes a corrugated pipe 171 , which is located in the lower chamber 112 in a zigzag manner, has one end communicating with the air moving pipe 164 of the dust collecting unit 160 and allows the residual heat of the exhaust air moved from the dust collector 160 to be dispersed into the inner space of the lower chamber 112 and the external air inside the lower chamber 112 to be heat-exchanged at a predetermined temperature. An exhaust fan (not shown), which is connected to the other end of the corrugated pipe 171 , allows the exhaust air to move through the fluidizing chamber 120 , the dust collector 160 and the corrugated pipe 171 to be discharged to the outside. Thus, according to the heat exchanging unit 170 , the external air flowing into the inside of the fluting chamber 120 from the inside of the lower chamber 112 due to the residual heat of the heated air discharged to the outside of the fluidizing chamber 120 is heat-exchanged so that the electric energy of the heating unit 130 can be saved. That is, according to the heat exchanging unit 170 , when the external air at room temperature is required to be preheated to 70° C. to 80° C. and heated to 250° C. to 300° C. through the heating unit 130 , electrical energy can be greatly saved. In addition, preferably, the upper chamber 111 and the lower chamber 112 have a structure that is separated and sealed from each other through a partition wall. Thus, a greenhouse function provided to the lower chamber 112 by the heat exchanging unit 170 may be maximized. The raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 is a raw coffee bean injecting unit, which is located outside the upper chamber 111 , is connected to the upper end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows the raw coffee beans to be injected into the fluidizing chamber 120 from the outside. As shown in FIGS. 1 , 2 and 3 , the coffee discharging unit 190 is a coffee discharging unit, which is configured in the lower chamber 112 and connected to the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 and allows roasted coffee to be discharged. Hereinafter, the operation of the coffee roaster according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. First, a predetermined amount of raw coffee beans is injected into the fluidizing chamber 120 through the raw coffee bean injecting unit 180 . Here, in the fluidizing chamber 120 , as the inclined surface 122 is formed at the lower end of the chamber body 121 , the density of raw coffee beans at the lower end of the chamber body 121 is higher than the density of raw coffee beans at the upper end of the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 . Thereafter, heated air having a predetermined temperature is sprayed and introduced into the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the chamber body 121 by the air supply unit 140 and the heating unit 130 . Thereafter, a movement in which the raw coffee beans injected into the lower end of the inside of the chamber body 121 by the stirring plate 125 positioned on the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 and the diffusion slot 126 configured in the air inlet 123 , are moved upwards into a space between inner surfaces of the stirring plate 125 and the chamber body 121 from the lower end of the inclined surface 122 by the heated air and then dropped to the inclined surface 122 of the chamber body 121 again, is repeatedly made so that the raw coffee beans are roasted in a fluidized method and then discharged to the outside through the coffee discharging unit 190 . On the other hand, the heated air introduced into the lower end of the chamber body 121 is moved along the heat exchanging unit 170 of the lower chamber 112 including the air supply unit 140 and the heating unit 130 via the dust collecting unit 160 so that the external air in the lower chamber 112 is heat-exchanged to a predetermined temperature by residual heat of the exhaust air and the electric energy of the heating unit 130 can be saved when heating air is supplied to the chamber body 121 . In addition, as the flow auxiliary unit 150 is connected from the air supply unit 140 to the air inlet 123 of the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 , the external air is directly sprayed into the lower end of the fluidizing chamber 120 at high speed, and even if the raw coffee beans are heavy, the fluidizing of the raw coffee beans can be improved and thus, the roasting effects can be improved. Therefore, according to the above description, heated air is supplied and discharged from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber 120 having a cylindrical structure into which raw coffee beans are injected, to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 , and the raw coffee beans are circulated (fluidized) from the lower part to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber 120 and roasted, thereby roasting while maximizing the characteristics of the raw coffee beans without burning the raw coffee beans. In addition, the fluidity of the raw coffee beans is maintained even when the raw coffee beans are heavy by high-speed spraying of external air through the flow auxiliary unit 150 into the lower part of the fluidizing chamber 120 , thereby maximizing fluidized roasting. In addition, the external air supplied to the fluidizing chamber 120 through the heat exchanging unit 170 is heat-exchanged with the heated air discharged from the fluidizing chamber 120 so that the electrical energy of the heating unit 130 can be saved. Accordingly, according to the present invention, heated air is supplied and discharged from a lower part of a fluidizing chamber to an upper part of the fluidizing chamber having a cylindrical structure in which raw coffee beans are injected and the raw coffee beans are circulated (fluidized) from the lower part of the fluidizing chamber to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber and roasted, thereby enabling roasting that maximizes the characteristics of the raw coffee beans while the raw coffee beans do not burn. In addition, external air is sprayed into the lower part of the fluidizing chamber at a high speed so that the fluidity of the raw coffee beans is maintained even when the raw coffee beans are heavy, thereby enabling fluidized roasting. In addition, external air in which heated air discharged to the upper part of the fluidizing chamber is supplied to the lower part of the fluidizing chamber, is preheated so that the electric energy of a heating unit can be saved. While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.","20230165292"

No. 62/977,765, filed Feb. 18, 2020, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to coffee brewing and, more specifically, a method of producing a flash brewed coffee concentrate. 2. Discussion of Related Art Cold brew coffee is gaining popularity amongst consumers for its unique flavor profile in a cold coffee beverage. Unfortunately, the process to prepare cold brew coffee in a manner in which a full range of flavors result can be a time consuming, and labor intensive process is required. Some cold brew coffee processes can take between six and twenty-four hours. One method of brewing coffee that is gaining popularity is a method of brewing known as “Japanese Pour Over.” In Japanese Pour Over, coffee is brewed with hot water, and then poured directly onto ice. The Japanese Pour Over brewing method allows for a quick extraction of flavor from coffee grounds and followed by rapid cooling to lock in the flavors and volatile aromatics. The Japanese Pour Over brewing method forms cold coffee with a full range of flavors that takes less time to brew than traditional cold brew methods. While the Japanese Pour Over brewing method may be suitable for gourmet coffee shops or in the home, it is not suitable for producing coffee on a commercial scale. For example, the Japanese Pour Over brewing method produces a ready-to-drink coffee that cannot be packed, stored, and transported for commercial use that requires an extended shelf-life. SUMMARY This disclosure relates generally to a method of forming a flash brewed coffee concentrate that produces a coffee extract having aromas and flavors similar to the Japanese Pour Over brewing method.

A coffee concentrate, as described herein, may be ultra-high-temperature (UHT) or aseptically packed before being distributed for use. In addition, a coffee concentrate, as described herein may be processed by further dilution before being distributed. For example, a coffee concentrate may be at 15° Brix such that it is a 1+7 dilution (1-part concentrate+7 parts water, milk, or non-dairy beverage) to make a ready to drink product and be processed by diluting the coffee concentrate to 9° Brix and distributed as a 1+3 dilution. Initially, the method 100 includes roasting the coffee beans (Step 120 ). With particular reference to FIG. 2 , before the coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ), green coffee beans 10 (FIG. 6 ) are selected, procured, or received (Step 112 ). Once the green coffee beans are received (Step 112 ), the green coffee beans are cleaned (Step 114 ). Cleaning the green coffee beans (Step 114 ) may include the use of screens 12 (FIG. 6 ) and magnets 14 (FIG. 6 ) to remove impurities from the green coffee beans. Once the green coffee beans are cleaned (Step 114 ), the green coffee beans may be blended (Step 116 ). For example, the green coffee beans may be blended using a thru blend scale 16 (FIG. 6 ). In some embodiments, green coffee beans from specific regions may be blended to achieve a desired flavor profile in the extract ultimately produced from the method 100 . Once the green coffee beans are cleaned and blended, the green coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ). The green coffee beans may be roasted in a coffee roaster 20 (FIG. 6 ) until the beans are at or below 66 on the Agtron degree of roast scale. For example, the green coffee beans may be roasted in a range of 25 to 60 on the Agtron degree of roast scale. To achieve the desired roast, the green coffee beans may be roasted at a minimum temperature of 388° F. for a minimum 7 minutes. The roasting time may vary depending on the degree of roast desired. Referring now to FIG. 3 , once the coffee beans are roasted (Step 120 ), the roasted coffee beans are ground (Step 130 ). The roasted coffee beans may be coarsely ground, e.g., a chunky grind, in a coffee grinder 30 (FIG. 6 ). Between roasting (Step 120 ) and grinding (Step 130 ), the roasted coffee beans may pass through several quality control and/or safety steps such as destoning (Step 122 ) or passing the roasted coffee beans past magnets, e.g., rare earth magnets 32 (FIG. 6 ). The steps 122 may remove impurities from the roasted coffee beans before grinding. Removing impurities from the roasted coffee beans may prevent impurities in the extract ultimately produced from method 100 and/or prevent damage to equipment used to grind the coffee beans and equipment downstream thereof. In addition, after the roasted coffee beans are ground (Step 130 ), the ground coffee may be screened (Step 132 ) to ensure that the ground coffee is satisfactorily ground. The screening (Step 132 ) may also remove small granules of coffee from the grinding process and/or impurities from the ground coffee. For example, the screening (Step 132 ) may have a first screen 34 (FIG. 6 ) that requires the ground coffee to pass through and a second screen 36 (FIG. 6 ), having a finer mesh, that prevents the desired ground coffee from passing through. The screening subsequent to grinding (Step 132 ) may ensure a relative uniformity of the ground coffee. With reference to FIG. 4 , the ground coffee is then flash brewed (Step 140 ) to bring out the brightness/acidity and complexity of the coffee without drawing out bitter/astringent notes of the coffee. The flash brewing process (Step 140 ) may use a single-wall stainless steel vessel 40 (FIG. 6 ) with an open top that is covered by a separate stainless-steel cover 42 (FIG. 6 ). In some embodiments, the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) occurs at atmospheric pressure such that the brewer is not a pressurized brewer. The ground coffee may be placed into a nylon filter bag that is inserted into a stainless-steel perforated brew basket 44 (FIG. 6 ) of the brewer (Step 142 ). With the ground coffee in the nylon filter bag, hot water is added to the brewer (Step 144 ). The hot water may be in a range of 165° F. to 205° F. and more specifically in a range of 180° F. to 185° F. Once the hot water is added to the brewer (Step 144 ), the ground coffee is contacted with or exposed to the hot water (Step 146 ). The contacting or exposing of the ground coffee to the hot water is done in a manner to promote even saturation of the ground coffee with the hot water. The ground coffee may steep in the hot water for a range of 5 minutes to 25 minutes, e.g., 20 minutes. In some embodiments, the ground coffee is plunged into the hot water. Plunging may include plunging the coffee in the nylon filter bag into the hot water using a hand device. Additionally or alternatively, contacting or exposing the ground coffee with the hot water may include mixing or submerging the ground coffee in hot water to saturate the ground coffee in the hot water or circulating the hot water over the ground coffee. After the ground coffee is contacted by or exposed to the hot water (Step 146 ) and during the steeping, the ground coffee may be agitated in the hot water (Step 147 ) one or more subsequent times to aid in contact of the hot water with the ground coffee. The agitation of the ground coffee in the hot water (Step 147 ) occurs before removal of the entire brew basket from the hot water. The agitation of the ground coffee in the hot water in the brewer (Step 147 ) may occur at one or more predetermined times or intervals during the steeping of the ground coffee, e.g., 5, 10, or 15 minutes. Agitation may include re-plunging or stirring ground coffee within the hot water or shifting the position of a nylon bag or brew basket within the hot water. Additionally or alternatively, it may include circulating hot water over the ground coffee. The short brew time at a high temperature can be referred to as a “flash hot brew”. It will be appreciated that the short steeping or brewing time in hot water may be optimal to bring out the brightness/acidity and complexity of the ground coffee without drawing out bitter/astringent notes of the ground coffee. Further, the short brew time may prevent over-steeping and thus over-extraction from the ground coffee. Further, the short brew time may minimize oxidation of the brewed hot coffee extract by reducing exposure to air during the brewing process. After the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) is complete, e.g., reached the desired steeping time, the brew basket is removed (Step 148 ) from hot coffee liquid extract within the brewer to stop the brewing process and to separate the ground coffee from the hot coffee extract. Specifically, the brew basket including the coffee grounds in the nylon filter bag is lifted or hoisted from the out of the brewer. The brew basket may be allowed to drain over the brewer for a predetermined time to allow additional hot coffee extract to drain from the ground coffee grounds in the brew basket into the hot coffee extract within the brewer. The brew basket may be allowed to drain in a range of 5 minutes to 20 minutes, e.g., in a range of 10 minutes to 15 minutes. During the brewing process, from the contacting of the ground coffee with the hot water (Step 146 ) to the removal of the brew basket (Step 148 ) the temperature of the hot coffee extract in the brewer may drop below 180° F. while remaining above 145° F. After flash brewing (Step 140 ), the hot coffee extract in the brewer has a concentration less than 15° Brix, e.g., in a range of 3° Brix to 12° Brix. Other flash brewing processes are contemplated to produce a hot coffee extract having a desired concentration less than 15° Brix. For example, a “continuous” brewing processes can be used to produce a hot coffee extract having a desired concentration less than 15° Brix. Referring now to FIG. 5 , when the hot coffee extract in the brewer has a concentration within a desired range and/or the desired steep time of the flash brew process is complete (Step 140 ) and the hot coffee extract has been separated from the brewer (Step 148 ), the hot coffee extract is rapidly chilled (Step 160 ). To rapidly chill the hot coffee extract to below 130° F. (Step 160 ), frozen concentrated coffee extract 50 (FIG. 6 ) that has been previously roasted, processed, and frozen is thawed to a temperature suitable for pumping or flowing the frozen concentrated coffee extract into a mixing kettle (Step 152 ). The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be thawed to a temperature less than or equal to 41° F. In some embodiments, the frozen concentrated coffee extract is thawed to a temperature in a range of 18° F. to 38° F., e.g., 25° F. The thawed frozen concentrated coffee extract is then pumped or added to a mixing kettle (Step 154 ). The thawed frozen concentrated coffee extract may be added in the form of a slurry with some portions of the frozen concentrated coffee extract being in a solid, frozen phase and other portions being in a liquid phase. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be pumped or added to the mixing kettle 60 (FIG. 6 ) with minimal agitation to the frozen concentrated coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may be pumped or added to the mixing kettle (Step 154 ) prior to, during, or after the flash brewing process (Step 140 ) of the hot coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract may have a concentration in a range of 18° Brix to 45° Brix. The frozen concentrated coffee extract within the mixing kettle may include an antifoam agent. In some embodiments, the antifoam agent may be added to the frozen concentrated coffee extract after the frozen concentrated coffee extract is in the mixing kettle, may be added as the frozen concentrated coffee extract is being pumped into the mixing kettle, may be included in the frozen concentrated coffee extract, or may be included in hot coffee extract. The frozen concentrated coffee extract is concentrated without heating of a coffee extract used to form the frozen concentrated coffee extract. For example, the frozen concentrated coffee extract may be formed from freezing a brewed coffee to remove water from the brewed coffee to increase a concentration of the brewed coffee. With the hot coffee extract brewed and separated by removing the brew basket from the hot coffee extract (Step 148 ) and the frozen concentrated coffee extract in the mixing kettle (Step 154 ), the hot coffee extract is pumped from the brewer into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped from the brewer into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ), the hot coffee extract may be filtered (Step 158 ). The filtering of the hot coffee extract may remove particulates including, but not limited to, ground coffee from the hot coffee extract, e.g., coffee fines. The filtering of the hot coffee extract (Step 158 ) may include passing the hot coffee extract through a dual stage micron filter bank 48 (FIG. 6 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped into the mixing kettle (Step 156 ), the hot coffee extract is mixed with and chilled by the frozen concentrated coffee extract within the mixing kettle to form a flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 160 ). As the hot coffee extract is pumped into the mixing kettle, the frozen concentrated coffee extract rapidly chills the hot coffee extract to a temperature less than 130° F. while increasing the concentration of the hot coffee extract such that the flash brewed coffee concentrate within the mixing kettle has a concentration greater than 15° Brix. In some embodiments, the frozen concentrated coffee extract may rapidly chill the hot coffee extract to a temperature in a range of 75° F. to 110° F. and more particularly, in a range of 85° F. to 95° F. The rapid chilling of the hot coffee extract (Step 160 ) stops any further heat exposure and stops oxidation of the hot coffee extract as the hot coffee extract is mixed with the frozen concentrated coffee extract to produce the flash brewed coffee concentrate. Referring back to FIG. 1 , after the flash brewed coffee concentrate is mixed (Step 160 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be briefly heated to a temperature less than 190° F., e.g., in a range of 110° F. to 185° F., to a temperature of less than 175° F., e.g., in a range of 160° F. to 170° F., or to a temperature of less than 135° F., e.g., in a range of 110° F. to 130° F., for a predetermined time to ensure that the frozen concentrated coffee extract is fully melted and that any coffee solids within the flash brewed coffee concentrate are evenly distributed within the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ). During the brief heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be agitated. For example, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be agitated in the mixing kettle at a rate of 30% to 50%. The heating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate and/or agitation of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may occur for 2 minutes to 5 minutes, e.g., 3 minutes. It will be appreciated that keeping the temperature to less than 190° F. may prevent the flavor development from being affected by the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ). A heat exchanger may be used to circulate flash brewed coffee concentrate to and from the mixing kettle until the desired temperature is reach or the mixing kettle 60 may include a water or steam jacket 62 (FIG. 6 ) that allows for controlled heating of the mixing kettle 60 . Before, during, or after the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), a sensory evaluation of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be conducted (Step 172 ). The sensory evaluation may include, but not be limited to, taste, smell, opacity, or color evaluation. After the heating and agitating of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 170 ), the flash brewed coffee concentrate is chilled to a temperature less than 45° F. (Step 180 ). The chilling of the flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 180 ) may be completed by pumping the flash brewed coffee concentrate from the mixing kettle and through a heat exchanger to chill the flash brewed coffee concentrate. The chilled flash brewed coffee concentrate may be filtered to remove any remaining undesirable materials from the chilled flash brewed coffee concentrate (Step 182 ), e.g., coffee fines or foreign materials. While remaining at a temperature less than 45° F., the flash brewed coffee concentrate is a refrigerated finished product that may be stored or packed for shipping. For example, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be packed in 275 gallon totes 70 (FIG. 6 ), 55 gallon drums, or other suitable food-grade containers. The flash brewed coffee concentrate may have a shelf-life of at least three months when kept sealed at a temperature less than 45° F. The flash brewed coffee concentrate, described herein, may be intended to be shipped refrigerated in bulk form for further diluting with water, dairy, or non-dairy solution. In some embodiments, the flash brewed coffee concentrate may be processed and packaged into smaller containers used in food service or retail applications including, but not limited to, pints, quarts, gallon PET or HDPE bottles, or 3 liter to 3 gallon bags-in-box (BIBs). The processing of the flash brewed coffee concentrate may include UHT processing or aseptic packaging. In some embodiments, the processing of the flash brewed coffee concentrate includes diluting the flash brewed coffee concentrate to a predetermined concentration, e.g., 1+7 dilution or 1+3 dilution. The flash brewed coffee concentrate may be prepared as a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage by mixing one-part flash brewed coffee concentrate with one or more parts liquid solution, such as water, milk, or non-dairy solution. This mixing may occur automatically in a dispenser or can be mixed and placed in a dispenser or pitcher at the establishment or in a home. It is contemplated that a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage may be a shelf-stable beverage or a refrigerated beverage that has been premixed at a processor with water, milk, or other non-dairy solution e.g., almond milk. In some embodiments, a ready-to-serve flash brew coffee beverage may be premixed and packaged by a processor into single serve containers, pints, quarts, gallon PET or HDPE bottles, or 3 liter to 3 gallon bags-in-box (BIBs). While several embodiments of the disclosure have been shown in the drawings, it is not intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is intended that the disclosure be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Any combination of the above embodiments is also envisioned and is within the scope of the appended claims.

No. 61/188,595 filed Aug. 11, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to beverages and more particularly to an apparatus and method for creating a flash frozen coffee beverage. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various coffee-based drinks are available such as cappuccino, espresso, flavored-coffees, and regular coffee. Some drinks are served chilled, some hot, and some with extra ingredients and toppings as well. Regardless of the way most coffee-based drinks are served, they typically start out as coffee beans that are brewed, steamed, roasted, or processed at the location where the drink is being served. Keeping coffee beans fresh is important to maintaining the flavor and aroma of drinks made using those beans. There are many techniques that have previously been used to try to maintain the freshness of coffee beans. While vacuum packing and other packaging are known techniques, it is also well known that freezing coffee beans appears to help maintain their freshness. However, enjoying a fresh tasting coffee drink requires either a laborious process at home using consumer-quality equipment or traveling to a coffee specialty shop where commercial-grade equipment can produce a quality drink but often at a hefty price. There remains the need, therefore, for a product and method of its manufacture and use which allows quality coffee flavored drinks to be easily and affordably produced by a typical consumer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of flash freezing a coffee-based liquid into small beads and then packaging the beads for consumers. The beads are stored in a conventional freezer until desired and then reconstituted into a coffee beverage base as needed. In particular, a cold coffee-based beverage may be easily and affordably created using the frozen beads. It is understood that other embodiments of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein it is shown and described only various embodiments of the invention by way of illustration. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other and different embodiments and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 depicts flash freezing apparatus in accordance with the principles of the present invention. FIG. 2 depicts exemplary beads in accordance with the principles of the present invention. FIG. 3 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method for making flash frozen coffee-based beads according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 4 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method for making flash frozen coffee-based beads according to another embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 5 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method of making a cold coffee-based beverage in accordance with the principles of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the invention and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the invention. As a result of the methods described herein, there are provided formulations of frozen coffee-based beverages in the form of small particulate shapes that remain free-flowing during storage and which can be used alone or in combination to be reconstituted into various coffee-based beverages. The particulate shapes, generally referred to as “beads”, may have a generally spherical, spheroid shape but may also have an oblong, elliptical, oblate, tubular, or other slightly irregular shape. In addition to having an irregular overall shape, the surface of the particulate shape may also be either smooth or irregular (e.g. bumpy, pocked, etc.). On average, the particulate shapes will preferably have a diameter of about 5 mm or less but can also be larger such as between about 6 and about 10 mm. Particulate shapes having diameters outside these ranges are also contemplated. For non-spherical shapes which do not have a conventional diameter, the diameter is considered to be the diameter of the smallest sphere into which the particulate shape would fit. It is desired that the particulate or beaded product is in a free-flowing format so that it is readily pourable or spoonable. Free-flowing, as used herein, is a broad term which includes the ability of the product to flow as individual particulate shapes, with little or no clumping or sticking to each other, during such pouring or spooning. There may be slight sticking after a period of storage, but a light tap on the container will unstick the particulate shapes and allow them to be free flowing. The generally spherical shape helps contribute to the free-flowing, pourable product. FIG. 1 shows a cryogenic processor constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention to produce free-flowing beads 56 . A cryogenic processor 10 includes a freezing chamber 12 that is most preferably in the form of a conical tank that holds a liquid refrigerant therein. A freezing chamber 12 incorporates an inner shell 14 and an outer shell 16 . Insulation 18 is disposed between the inner shell 14 and outer shell 16 in order to increase the thermal efficiency of the chamber 12 . Vents 20 are also provided to ventilate the insulated area formed between the shells 14 and 16 . The freezing chamber 12 is a free-standing unit supported by legs 22 . A refrigerant 24 , preferably liquid nitrogen, enters the freezing chamber 12 by means of refrigerant inlet 26 . The refrigerant 24 is introduced into a chamber 12 through the inlet 26 in order to maintain a predetermined level of liquid refrigerant in the freezing chamber because some refrigerant 24 can be lost by evaporation or by other means incidental to production. Gaseous refrigerant that has evaporated from the surface of the liquid refrigerant 24 in freezing chamber 12 primarily vents to the atmosphere through exit port 29 which cooperates with the vacuum assembly 30 , which can be in the form of a venturi nozzle. Extraction of the frozen beads occurs through product outlet 32 adapted at the base of the freezing chamber 12 . An ambient air inlet port 28 with adjustment doors 38 and exit port 29 with adjustment doors 39 are provided to adjust the level of gaseous refrigerant which evaporates from the surface of the liquid refrigerant 24 so that excessive pressure is not built up within the processor 10 and freezing of the liquid composition in the feed assembly 40 does not occur. A feed tray 48 receives liquid composition from a delivery source 50 . Typically, a pump (not shown) drives the liquid composition through a delivery tube 52 into the feed tray 48 . A premixing device 54 allows several compositions, not all of which must be liquid, such as powdered flavorings or other additives of a size small enough not to cause clogging in the feed assembly 40 , to be mixed in predetermined concentrations for delivery to the feed tray 48 . In order to create uniformly sized particles or beads 56 of frozen product, uniformly sized droplets of liquid composition are desirable that are to be fed through gas diffusion chamber 46 to freezing chamber 12 . The feed tray 48 is designed with feed assembly 40 that forms droplets of the desired character. The frozen product takes the form of beads that are formed when the droplets of liquid composition contact the refrigerant vapor in the gas diffusion chamber 46 , and subsequently the liquid refrigerant 24 in the freezing chamber 12 . After the beads 56 are formed, they fall or are mechanically directed to the bottom of chamber 12 . A transport system connects to the bottom of chamber 12 at outlet 32 to carry the beads 56 to a packaging and distribution network for later delivery and consumption. The vacuum assembly 30 cooperates with air inlet 28 and adjustment doors 38 so that ambient air flows through the inlet and around feed assembly 40 to ensure that no liquid composition freezes therein. This is accomplished by mounting the vacuum assembly 30 and air inlet 28 on opposing sides of the gas diffusion chamber 46 such that the incoming ambient air drawn by the vacuum assembly 30 is aligned with the feed assembly. In this configuration, ambient air flows around the feed assembly warming it to a sufficient temperature to inhibit the formation of frozen liquid composition in the feed assembly flow channels. An air source 60 , typically in the form of an air compressor, is attached to vacuum assembly 30 to provide appropriate suction to create the ambient air flow desired. In accordance with preferred embodiments, there are provided formulations of frozen coffee flavored confections in the form of small particulate shapes. The particulate shapes may have a generally spherical, spheroid shape as shown in FIG. 2 (e.g., 1001 , 1003 , 1005 ), but may also have an oblong, elliptical, oblate, tubular, or other slightly irregular shape as also shown in FIG. 2 (e.g., 1007 , 1009 ). In addition to having an irregular overall shape, the surface of the particulate shape may also be either smooth or irregular (e.g. bumpy, pocked, etc.). On average, the particulate shapes will preferably have a diameter of about 0.05 inch to about 0.5 inch or less, including 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.25 inch, 0.2 inch, 0.15 inch, and about 0.1 inch, and ranges including and bordered by these dimensions. Particulate shapes having diameters outside these ranges are also contemplated. For non-spherical shapes which do not have a conventional diameter, the diameter is to be the diameter of the smallest sphere into which the particulate shape would fit. As mentioned earlier, it is desired that the beaded product is in a free-flowing format so that it is readily pourable or spoonable. Free-flowing, as used herein, is a broad term which includes the ability of the product to flow as individual particulate shapes, with little or no clumping or sticking to each other, during such pouring or spooning. There may be slight sticking after a period of storage, but a light tap on the container will unstick the particulate shapes and allow them to be free flowing. The generally spherical shape helps contribute to the free-flowing, pourable product. In preferred embodiments, particulate shapes that can be stored at higher temperatures, such as in a home freezer or in a grocery dairy freezer are provided, such particulate shapes being able to maintain a free-flowing form while being stored at a temperature between about −10° F. and 0° F. with an occasional rise to perhaps as much as +5° F. One way to accomplish this is to increase the freezing point (reduce the freeze-point depression) of the liquid formulation that forms the particulate shapes, although other ways may also be used. FIG. 3 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method of making a coffee-based particulate beads in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The first step 302 shown in FIG. 3 is that of preparing the coffee-based liquid. While the base ingredient of this liquid is coffee, there are a number of additional ingredients and flavors that may be added as well during the preparation process, in accordance with other embodiments. Dairy products, flavored syrups, flavored oils, sugars, sweeteners, herbs, spices and the like may be added, for example in a raw form or pre-processed form. In preparing the coffee-based liquid, the coffee may be brewed, steamed or pressed to have a particular strength, caffeine content, or other desired characteristic. Also, flavors from various liqueurs and syrups, as well as the ingredients listed above, may be part of the formulation as well, either before or after the coffee-based liquid is prepared. The number of various formulations that may be turned into coffee-based liquids in accordance with the principles of the present invention are limited only by the creativity of the food scientist and the preferences of consumers. As is known, coffee-based liquids may be prepared by various brewing methods as well as alternative methods as well. For example, in accordance with at least one embodiment, the coffee-based liquid is substantially traditional espresso. Espresso is prepared from dark, roasted coffee beans that are first ground to a desired size. Then water at around 195 to 200° F. is forced through the finely ground coffee at between 9-15 bars of pressure. The resulting coffee-based liquid has a highly concentrated coffee flavor. Once the liquid is prepared, another opportunity exists, at step 304 , to add additional flavors, ingredients or additives in order to formulate a variety of different coffee-based liquids. In step 306 , the coffee-based liquid is cooled. The cooling can be accomplished by a variety of different methods that are well known. Preferably the coffee-based liquid is cooled to about 40° F. in a matter of minutes or less. While as low a temperature as possible is desirable to improve the efficiency of later cryogenic processing, the temperature to which the liquid is cooled depends on the desired viscosity of the liquid as it is transported through to later stages of processing. Thus, additives may be included, such as stabilizers, that allow cooling to lower temperatures while ensuring the liquid easily flows and improve the liquids freezing characteristics. The coffee-based liquid is transported such as by being pumped, in step 308 , to a frozen bead-making apparatus such as, for example, the device shown and described earlier with respect to FIG. 1. As mentioned, the consistency of the liquid may be adjusted to accommodate the pump 50 and the temperature of the liquid may be adjusted as well by well known cooling techniques that can be applied during transport to the freezing apparatus. The temperature and consistency may also adjusted to help the development of uniformly-sized beads within the freezing apparatus. Depending on the viscosity of the original fluid, different temperatures and consistencies may be used for different liquids that are dispensed into the freezing apparatus. The next step, 310 , is to freeze the coffee-based liquid into beads as described with respect to FIG. 1. These beads can then be transported to a packaging machine. The transporting of the beads can be accomplished in a variety of different ways such as by a feed screw, a moving conveyor belt, or gravity feed. The transporting means can also be cooled such that the beads remain cool while being transported to the packager. In general, the entire process from the grinding of the coffee beans to the packaging and storing of the beads can be accomplished in a time-frame measured in minutes and is, preferably accomplished in less than 10 minutes. In this way, a flash-frozen coffee-based product is produced that can be easily reconstituted to make a fresh tasting coffee beverage. However, process times greater than or less than 10 minutes may be desirable in some embodiments and are contemplated within the scope of the present invention. Using the example embodiment described above, the resulting coffee-based frozen particulate beads can have a relatively highly concentrated coffee flavor. Alternatively, the coffee-based liquid that is fed through the cryogenic process may be freshly brewed coffee instead of espresso. FIG. 4 depicts a flowchart of an exemplary method of producing frozen beads using brewed coffee. The steps are substantially the same as the steps described with respect to FIG. 3. In step 402 , the coffee-based liquid is prepared such as by brewing coffee using known techniques and then additional flavors or additives can be incorporated in step 404 . If necessary, the resulting liquid can then be cooled in step 406 , transported to a cryogenic processor, in step 408 , where it is flash frozen into beads, in step 410 . Once flash frozen, the beads can then be packaged, in step 412 , and stored. The brewed coffee liquid may have a consistency and viscosity that is not optimal for transporting and freezing. For example, the water content may be too high for efficient bead formation and freezing. Additionally, the ultimate beverage that results when the beads are reconstituted may require so many beads to have the desired coffee flavor that the product is unappealing. Thus, in step 406 , the coffee-based liquid may be concentrated by extracting a portion of the water as it is cooled. The resulting liquid may therefore have a stronger coffee flavor and be easier to freeze into relatively uniform beads. However, using original strength brewed coffee is contemplated as well. One of ordinary skill will recognize that different flavored beads may be frozen in separate freezing apparatuses at the same time or in the same freezing apparatus in a sequential manner. These different flavor beads can then be combined in different ratios at the packaging machine. In this way, different combinations of flavored coffee-based beverages may be created using the same set of beads in various permutations and combinations. Of course, a product consisting of one type of flavored bead is contemplated. Once the beads are packaged and delivered to a consumer such as an individual, a coffee shop, a store, or a restaurant, the beads are stored in a conventional freezer until they are used to make a beverage. Although the beads are frozen at cryogenic temperatures, there is no requirement that they remain cooled to temperatures as low as −40° F. but, instead, may be maintained at the standard operating temperatures of commercial and consumer freezers. However, storing them at even lower temperatures may allow using less of the beads to cool a beverage to a desired temperature. In addition to the espresso beads and the brewed coffee beads discussed above, embodiments of the present invention also contemplate coffee-flavored beads as well that more closely resemble flash frozen ice cream products. These beads have a less concentrated coffee flavor than beads made substantially from brewed coffee or espresso. Thus, in addition to coffee-based beverages being obtainable, beverages having more subtle coffee flavor are also possible. Instead of espresso or brewed coffee being the liquid or slurry that is flash frozen, a coffee-flavored mixture as described below is flash frozen to form beads having coffee flavor (and additional flavors if desired). For any of the types of beads discussed, the apparatus and method of FIG. 1 may used as well as other cryogenic freezing processes. An exemplary method of manufacturing the coffee-flavored frozen food product, includes preparing a formulation, wherein the formulation is preferably made by combining liquid ingredients, combining dry powders, and mixing the combined dry powders with the combined liquids to make the formulation, and where the method continues by agitating the formulation, pasteurizing the formulation, homogenizing the formulation, aging the formulation, and dripping the formulation into a cryogenic processor to form a particulate frozen food product. In a preferred embodiment, the homogenizing step acts to synchronize the pasteurizing step. In certain embodiments, based on the ingredients of the formulation, the pasteurizing step may be omitted. Also, one or more of the other steps in the above list may be optional depending on the formulation and desired end product. One example of a formulation for a coffee-flavored frozen food product, includes water and total solids, wherein the food product may include, in addition to coffee flavor, 6-14% by weight milk fat, 4-24% by weight non-fat milk solids, and 2.6-8% by weight sugar. In preferred products the product is in the form of particulate shapes which remain free-flowing when stored in a freezer at 0° F. In certain embodiments, the food product further includes one or more of the following: 0.1-0.4% by weight sweetener; 1-20% by weight bulking agent; 0.1-1% by weight of cryoprotectant; one or more natural and/or artificial flavors; and 1-4% combined stabilizer/emulsifier. In certain embodiments, the product may have at least about 29% by weight total solids and less than about 71% by weight water allowing the product to remain free flowing when stored in a freezer at 0° F. Preferred bulking agents include, but are not limited to, maltodextrins. As stated, it is desired to store the particulate shapes within a conventional freezer and yet still maintain their free-flowing properties. To achieve this, various sample liquid formulations used in making the particulate shapes will now be described some which are dairy based and some which are not. It should be noted that the formulations described below are only examples, and numerous other formulations containing various amounts of ingredients as described herein may be made. Some of the components of three different example formulation types are as follows (all percentages are by weight of the total formulation): Ingredient Formulation I Formulation II Formulation III Milk fat (butterfat) 9-11% 6-14% Non-fat milk solids 4-12% 4-20% Maltodextrins (or other 0-20% 0-20% 0-10% bulking agent) Sugar 15-17% 2.6-8% 2-10% sweetener (artificial) <0.4% <0.8% combined <1% (if <4% (if <1% (stabilizer stabilizer/emulsifier present) present) only) total solids >=35.5% >=29.7% Water (coffee flavor) <=63.5% <=70.3% 70-96% The freezing point of the various formulations disclosed herein which form the particulate shapes can be increased by making adjustments to one or more of the above components, and some adjustments work better in combination with each other. As shown above, some of the formulations above comprise various total solids combined with water. Within the particulate shapes, water is present both as a liquid and as a solid. This is because not all water freezes, due to the presence of dissolved solutes and the cryogenic freezing itself. The solid/liquid ratio within the particulate shapes affects their firmness. This in turn affects pourability and the ability of the particulate shapes to remain free-flowing. Other factors may affect the pourability, including, but not limited to, size of the ice crystals, freezing point, melting point, glass transition temperature, presence or absence of devitrification, storage temperature and conditions. In the United States, the total solids content must be 35.55% to legally describe a product as ice cream. Accordingly, formulations according to formulation I are considered ice creams in the U.S. This is because most ice creams finished ice cream product must weight at least 4.5 lb/gal and must contain at least 1.6 lb of food solids or total solids per gallon, which essentially equates to a minimum total food solids of 35.5%. In the USA, any finished product below these limits cannot be labeled ice cream. However, other countries have different requirements. For example, in several countries other than the U.S. the total solids content of a formulation can be as low as 29.7%, and possibly lower, yet still be labeled ice cream. Accordingly, formulations according to Formulation II preferably have solids at a level that is considered ice cream in jurisdictions outside the U.S. Therefore, in certain preferred embodiments, the total solids in a frozen confection is at least about 25%, at least about 26%, at least about 26.5%, at least about 27%, at least about 27.5%, at least about 28%, at least about 28.5%, at least about 29%, at least about 30%, at least about 31%, at least about 32%, at least about 33%, at least about 34%, at least about 35%, at least about 36%, or at least about 37%, wherein stated percentages are by weight of the weight of the total formulation including water. One component of the solids of dairy formulations such as those according to Formulae I and II is milkfat. The milkfat, also called butterfat, in the composition provides much of the creamy texture and body to the formulation, with higher levels providing greater creaminess and richness. Serum solids or nonfat milk solids are those components of milk and/or cream which are water soluble, including but not limited to caseins and other milk proteins. It is to be noted that although milkfat and water are listed as separate ingredients, milkfat, water and serum solids are, in most embodiments, included in the milks and creams that form the basis of the dairy Formulations I and II, and thus do not necessarily comprise separate ingredients. Nonfat milk solids enhance the texture of ice cream, aid in giving body and chew resistance, and may be less expensive than milkfat. Whey solids, including modified whey products, may also be substituted for nonfat milk solids but, under USA federal government requirements, not for more than 25% of the total nonfat milk solids in the overall formulation. Egg yolk can also be used as another source of solids. Accordingly, in one embodiment, preferably about 1% to 25%, including 5% to 20% and 10% to 15% of the nonfat milk solids in a formulation comprise whey solids and/or egg yolk solids. Emulsifiers can also be included within the various formulations, especially those containing milkfat. Preferred emulsifiers can include monoglycerides, diglycerides, and polysorbates. Stabilizers may be included within the various formulations. Stabilizers assist in controlling the viscosity of the formulations, with more stabilizer generally providing increased viscosity, especially in those embodiments having lower amounts of fats and solids. The viscosity affects the drip rate of the formulation while it is formed. Within the dairy Formulations I and II, preferred stabilizers can include guar, carrageenan, LBG, and/or CMC. Within the non-dairy Formulation III, a preferred stabilizer can include cellulose gum. In those dairy embodiments where both stabilizers and emulsifiers are used, the formulations disclosed herein for making the frozen confection includes a combined stabilizer/emulsifier, and the recited amounts are the combined total of the stabilizer and emulsifier present. The combined stabilizer/emulsifier need not actually be added as a single ingredient when making the formulation; the weights of these two materials are included together because in many embodiments, commercial combined stabilizer/emulsifier formulations are used, which include one or more stabilizers and one or more emulsifiers. Accordingly, the stabilizer/emulsifier may be a commercial or proprietary formulation or it may be a combination or series of one or more stabilizers and/or one or more emulsifiers added to the formulation. One or more bulking agents may also be added to formulations according to certain embodiments. Bulking agents include high molecular weight polymeric compounds (such as polysaccharides), which add viscosity and bulk to foods. Preferred bulking agents include, but are not limited to polydextrose, dextrans, corn syrup solids, and maltodextrins. In certain preferred embodiments, maltodextrins are used, including, but not limited to, those having a DE of 5, 10, 15, and 20, where DE refers to “dextrose equivalent”. In a preferred embodiment, the total amount of bulking agents is 1% to 20% by weight, including 1%-15% by weight, 5%-15% by weight, including 6%, 8%, 10% and 12% by weight. Because bulking agents and stabilizers both contribute to the viscosity of a formulation, formulations containing a bulking agent may or may not include a stabilizer or stabilizer/emulsifier. The ultimate use for the frozen beads is to use them to produce a beverage for consumption. This can be accomplished in a variety of different ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, for warm beverages, the frozen beads may be brewed or steamed to reconstitute them much like coffee beans. The frozen beads may also be ground similar to regular coffee beans and used to make espresso and other similar beverages. However, another benefit of the frozen beads is that they may be used or mixed to create cold coffee-based drinks while reducing or eliminating the need for ice cubes. Thus, the resulting beverage is not as watered-down as if ice cubes are used to make the cold drink. Also, because of the freezing method, ice crystal formation will be different than if ice cubes are used which improves the mouth-feel of the resulting beverage. Milk, water and other liquids may be used when reconstituting the frozen beads into the desired beverage. A combination of any or just some of the brewed coffee beads, the espresso beads, and the coffee-flavor beads can be formulated in order to achieve a desired coffee flavor strength for a variety of different cold drinks. Accordingly, the packaging of the frozen beads can be accomplished in a variety of different ways depending on the desired product. For example, the beads may be packed in a cup sized container that is for a single serving. For example, 8 oz. of beads (whatever variety or combination) may be packaged in a cup with room for 8 oz. of milk (or other liquid) to be added. Additional room can be provided in order to accommodate other additional flavors and confections. Alternatively, the beads can be packaged in bulk packages from which a user can extract the desired amount of product to be reconstituted. Utilizing the espresso beads, brewed coffee beads, and the coffee flavored beads described earlier, various ingredients can be added to create any of the well known cold coffee beverages currently available and those to be created in the future. In general, a flowchart is shown in FIG. 5 of a method for making a coffee drink from the frozen beads described earlier. In step 502 , the desired amount of beads are acquired. While these beads can be any of the flash-frozen coffee-based, or coffee-flavored beads as described earlier, using the coffee-flavored beads will allow more subtle coffee flavors to be created which can always be augmented by other more strongly flavored beads. Depending on the desired beverage and the type of beads, the amount of beads selected in step 502 will vary. The ingredients that will be combined with this coffee beverage base can vary widely. For example, milk, frothed milk, steamed milk, cream, and whipped cream are all likely candidates to add so as to make a variety of cold coffee-based beverages. Furthermore, the milk can vary from 1%, 2%, skim, lowfat, whole, and untraditional milk products such as soy, rice, goat, and the like. These additional ingredients can also includes syrups and flavors such as those traditionally paired with coffee such as chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut, Irish creme, caramel, peppermint, butter rum, mint, coffee liqueur, and others. In cold coffee beverages fruity flavors, soda water, and ice can be added as well. Thus, in step 504 , the additional ingredients are prepared in a manner appropriate for addition to the coffee beverage base and then everything is combined in step 506 to create a cold coffee beverage. In step 508 , the strength of the coffee flavor in the cold beverage can be increased by adding either espresso beads or brewed coffee beads as desired by the user. As an example recipe, 8 oz. of coffee-flavored beads can be combined with 8 oz. of milk to yield a cold coffee drink of about 16 oz. The beads and milk can, for example, be combined by shaking or using a blender. The resulting beverage can be garnished with additional ingredients such as whipped cream, chocolate sauce, or caramel sauce.

FIELD The present application relates to coffee products and processes for forming coffee products. In particular, it relates to soluble coffee products incorporating a percentage of roasted ground coffee and processes for forming such products. BACKGROUND Instant soluble coffee products, such as freeze-dried and spray-dried instant coffee, are well known. An example of a freeze-dried instant coffee is Kenco® Smooth freeze dried coffee. Such instant soluble coffee products are formed by deriving a liquid coffee concentrate intermediate (commonly known as coffee liquor) from coffee beans by the well known processes of roasting and extraction. Optionally, the coffee concentrate may be aromatized by the addition of coffee aromas stripped from an extracted coffee intermediate, again as well known in the art. The coffee concentrate is then subjected to various foaming and drying steps to produce a dry granular end product that can be reconstituted into a coffee beverage by the addition of hot water. Instant soluble coffee products are popular with consumers as they provide an economical, fast and simple way of preparing a coffee beverage. However, there has been a desire to produce instant soluble coffee products which are more reminiscent of roasted ground coffee products both in the appearance of the product prior to reconstitution and when consumed. It is known to incorporate in a soluble coffee product a percentage of roasted ground coffee in order to attempt to produce a more appealing instant soluble coffee product. For example, WO2010/005604 describes various soluble coffee products blended from soluble and ground coffee components. A problem that the present applicant has found with soluble coffee products incorporating a roasted ground coffee component is that it is difficult to adequately disperse the roasted ground coffee particles within the liquid coffee concentrate intermediate. Poor dispersion can lead to clumping of the roasted ground coffee particles on addition to the liquid coffee intermediate leading to non-hydrated regions of roasted ground coffee which never fully ‘wet’. Partly in order to try and overcome the problem of poor dispersion it has been known to try and reduce the roast and coffee particle size down to colloidal particle sizes of less than about 30 to 40 microns. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,257 describes an agglomerated instant coffee product comprising spray-dried instant coffee and roasted coffee colloidal particles having a particle size of 5 to 25 microns. However, in order to produce colloidal sized particles of roasted ground coffee it is necessary to utilise special grinding processes since the coffee oil contained in the roasted ground coffee has a tendency to be released when the particles are ground to such a small size. Coffee oil release leads to detrimental affects on the grinding process such as clumping of the coffee particles and fouling of the grinding machine surfaces necessitating regular machine cleaning and consequent down time. In order to overcome this problem it is known to cryogenically pre-freeze the roasted coffee beans prior to them being ground down to colloidal sizes. For example, in WO2010/005604 the roasted coffee beans are frozen to a temperature of about −5° C. and then pulverised into particles with a mean or median particle size of about 350 microns or less. In another example, GB2022394 describes a process of quenching roasted coffee beans in liquid nitrogen before being ground to a particle size of less than 45 microns. The requirement to cryogenically freeze the roasted coffee beans prior to grinding increases the complexity and expense of the manufacturing process. Another suggested solution to permit colloidal grinding of roasted coffee beans is to add additional oil to the grinding mixture to provide additional lubrication. Whilst this can in some situations overcome the problem of fouling of the grinding machine surfaces it results in a ground coffee product with a high oil content that is not ideal for use as a coffee intermediate for further processing into an instant soluble coffee beverage since only a relatively small amount can be added to products without a detrimental affect on the product composition. Another suggested solution in EP1631151 is to add an additional component such as cocoa mass or sugar to absorb any coffee oil released by the roasted and ground coffee. However, this process is unsuitable where the desire is to use the colloidal roasted ground coffee in a pure soluble coffee beverage. Another known desire is to attempt to make the visual appearance of the instant soluble coffee product more like that of roasted ground coffee. Typically, instant soluble coffee products are lighter in colour than roasted ground coffee. There has therefore been a desire to darken the colour of instant soluble coffee products, in particular freeze-dried soluble coffee. Prior art methods for darkening the colour of soluble coffee include the use of steam darkeners as described in EP0700640 and re-wetting of a freeze-dried intermediate as described in EP0090561. In addition CO 2 gasification has been used to darken soluble coffee products. However, prior art techniques for darkening the appearance of a soluble coffee product have certain drawbacks. Re-wetting of the intermediate coffee product by addition of water or use of steam or the use of gases, such as CO 2 , can alter the density and solubility of the end product. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE In this specification unless otherwise required by the context, the term “roasted coffee” means a coffee substance that has been produced by the roasting of green coffee beans. The substance may be in the form of a roasted coffee bean or in some other form produced by onward processing steps such as grinding, decaffeination, pressing, etc. Particular examples of roasted coffee include roasted coffee beans, roasted expeller cake, roasted and flaked coffee. In this specification unless otherwise required by the context, the term “roasted ground coffee” means a roasted coffee substance that has been subject to a comminution process in order to reduce the particle size of the original roasted coffee substance. Again, unless otherwise required by the context the comminution process may include one or more of grinding, chopping, pounding and crushing. In this specification, the term “Helos particle size distribution D90”, means the 90th percentile figure by volume of the particle size distribution, as obtained from a Helos™ laser light diffraction particle size analyzer available from Sympatec, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany. That is, the D90 is a value on the distribution such that 90% by volume of the particles have a characteristic size of this value or less. The figure may be obtained for a dry sample (referred to as “dry Helos”) or for a wet sample (referred to as “wet Helos”), e.g. after mixing of the particles with water. Likewise for D50 where the value represents the 50th percentile figure of the particle size distribution. Helos is a laser diffraction sensor system for which one evaluation method is applied over the whole measuring range from 0.1 μm to 8750 μm. This instrument is designed for particle size analysis of dry and wet samples, i.e. of powders, suspensions, emulsions or sprays. For wet Helos measurements, the beverage is made up to 1.5% concentration (3 g solids in 200 ml water) using 100° C. water and dripped into cuvette (with magnetic stirrer coated with PTFE running at 1000 RPM) to aim for an optical concentration between 20 and 25%. When using ultrasound, an integrated sonication finger made from Titanium can be lowered manually into the cuvette. There are three options to measure particle size on the Helos system: Settings used for micro Method name Measuring range Application milled coffee Dry PSD 0.1-3500 μm Direct Lens: R4 (1.8-250 μm measurement for Copt 1.5% ref, with R4) milled product 20 s Dispersion 100% 4 mm 3 bar Wet PSD 0.1-3500 μm Allows Lens: R3 (0.5-175 μm with dissolution of Cuvette R3) soluble coffee settings product and gives roasted ground particle size formed in cup by hand stirring Wet PSD 0.1-3500 μm Allows Lens: R3 with (0.5-175 μm with dissolution of Cuvette ultrasound R3) soluble coffee settings and break-up of Ultrasonication roasted ground time 60 sec clumps giving better indication of individual particle size Dry Particle Size Distribution is measured using HELOS/KF, R4 Lens, RODOS/M Dispersing System and VIBRI Feeder manufactured by Sympatec GmbH. Wet Particle Size Distribution is measured using HELOS/KF, R3 Lens, CUVETTE Dispersing System manufactured by Sympatec GmbH. In this specification, the reference to colour in “La units” means the unit reading measured using visible light reflectance of a sample of the roasted ground or soluble coffee using a Dr. Lange® Colour Reflectance Meter Model LK-100 with an internal 640 nm filter, available from Dr. Lange GmbH, Dusseldorf, Germany. The La scale is based on the Hunter 1948 L,a,b, color space, where the L component measures ‘lightness’ with L=0 being black and L=100 being a perfect diffuse reflector. Therefore the lower the La number the darker the sample measured. In a first aspect, the present disclosure describes a freeze-dried soluble coffee product comprising 5 to 30% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 70 to 95% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee, wherein the roasted ground coffee has a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 100 microns; the freeze-dried soluble coffee product having a colour of 13 to 30 La units on the Lange scale. Preferably, the freeze-dried soluble coffee product comprises 10 to 20% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 80 to 90% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. In one example, the freeze-dried soluble coffee product comprises 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. It will be appreciated that whilst the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has been described as comprising both roasted ground coffee and soluble coffee this does not preclude the possibility of the product also comprising additional components. Surprisingly, it has been found that the incorporation of roasted ground coffee of small particle size into a freeze-dried soluble coffee product produces a darker end product that is more visually reminiscent of roasted ground coffee. By comparison, prior art freeze-dried soluble coffee products typically have a colour of greater than 25 La units Even use of the prior art process of gasification was unable to produce an end product with a colour of less than 21 La units. Further, prior art roasted ground coffee typically has a colour of 6 to 13 La units. Preferably the roasted ground coffee has a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 50 microns, more preferably less than or equal to 30 microns. Preferably the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a colour of 16 to 25 La units on the Lange scale. More preferably the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a colour of 17 to 20 La units on the Lange scale. Preferably the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a density of 185 to 265 g/liter. More preferably the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a density of 205 to 235 g/liter. In one example the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a density of 225 g/liter. Advantageously, the darkening of the end product by addition of roasted ground coffee particles allows an end product to be produced that achieves consumer-expected density and solubility levels. Preferably the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a particle size range of 0.3 to 3.5 mm. More preferably the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a particle size range of 0.3 to 2.5 mm. In one example the freeze-dried soluble coffee product has a particle size range of 0.3 to 1.5 mm. The freeze-dried product is enabled to be ground and sieved to a particle size that is reminiscent of a roasted ground coffee product. The roasted ground coffee may be obtained by known processes such as cryogenic milling of roasted coffee beans as well known in the art and described, by way of example, in GB2022394 noted above. However, preferably the roasted ground coffee is obtained by the novel comminution process of a fourth aspect of the present disclosure as will be described further below. Preferably, the freeze-dried soluble coffee product is produced by the novel process of a second aspect of the present disclosure which will be described further below. In a second aspect, the present disclosure describes a process of forming a freeze-dried soluble coffee product, comprising the steps of: i) forming a concentrated coffee extract; ii) foaming and pre-freezing the concentrated coffee extract to form a foamed and pre-frozen coffee intermediate; iii) freezing the foamed and pre-frozen coffee intermediate to form a frozen coffee intermediate; iv) grinding and sieving the frozen coffee intermediate to form a ground coffee intermediate; v) drying the ground coffee intermediate to form the freeze-dried soluble coffee product; wherein prior to step ii) and/or step iii) a milled and blended coffee intermediate is incorporated; wherein the milled and blended coffee intermediate comprises 10 to 80% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 20 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee. In a third aspect, the present disclosure describes a process of forming a spray-dried soluble coffee product, comprising the steps of: i) forming a concentrated coffee extract; ii) foaming the concentrated coffee extract to form a foamed coffee intermediate; iii) optionally filtering and homogenizing the foamed coffee intermediate to form a filtered and homogenized coffee intermediate; iv) spray drying the foamed coffee intermediate or the filtered and homogenized coffee intermediate to form the spray-dried soluble coffee product; wherein prior to step ii) and/or step iv) a milled and blended coffee intermediate is incorporated; wherein the milled and blended coffee intermediate comprises 10 to 80% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 20 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee. Surprisingly, it has been found that incorporating a milled and blended coffee intermediate (formed from roasted ground coffee particles and soluble coffee particles) as part of the soluble coffee forming process results in very good dispersion of the roasted ground particles throughout the concentrated coffee extract Preferably, the milled and blended coffee intermediate of the second or third aspects comprises 10 to 70% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 30 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee. More preferably, the milled and blended coffee intermediate of the second or third aspects comprises 15 to 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 50 to 85% by dry weight soluble coffee. In one example the milled and blended coffee intermediate of the second or third aspects comprises 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 50% by dry weight soluble coffee. It will be appreciated that whilst the milled and blended coffee intermediate of the second or third aspects has been described as comprising both roasted ground coffee and soluble coffee this does not preclude the possibility of the intermediate also comprising additional components. Preferably, the milled and blended coffee intermediate of the second or third aspects has a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 40 microns. More preferably the milled and blended coffee intermediate of the second or third aspects has a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 30 microns. Preferably, in the process of the second or third aspects the freeze-dried or spray-dried coffee product comprises 5 to 30% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 70 to 95% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. More preferably the freeze-dried or spray-dried coffee product comprises 10 to 20% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 80 to 90% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. In one example the freeze-dried or spray-dried coffee product comprises 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. It will be appreciated that whilst the freeze-dried or spray-dried coffee product has been described as comprising both roasted ground coffee and soluble coffee this does not preclude the possibility of the product also comprising additional components. The soluble coffee of the milled and blended coffee intermediate may comprise spray-dried instant coffee, freeze-dried instant coffee, or a mixture thereof. The ground coffee intermediate of the process of forming a freeze-dried soluble coffee product described above prior to drying may have a total coffee solids concentration of greater than or equal to 52% and less than or equal to 63%. The coffee intermediate of the process of forming a spray-dried soluble coffee product described above prior to drying may have a total coffee solids concentration of greater than or equal to 52% and less than or equal to 63%. In either case the total coffee solids concentration may preferably be 56% to 60%. The second and third aspects of the present disclosure extend to a soluble coffee product produced by the above described processes. In addition, the second and third aspects of the present disclosure extend to a coffee beverage formed using the soluble coffee product described above. In a fourth aspect, the present disclosure describes a coffee milling process comprising the steps of: a) introducing particles of a roasted coffee precursor into a milling chamber; b) introducing particles of soluble coffee into the milling chamber; c) jetting a gas into the milling chamber to mobilise the particles of the roasted coffee precursor and soluble coffee; d) thereby producing a milled and blended coffee product by comminuting the particles of the roasted coffee precursor by self-collision of the particles of the roasted coffee precursor and by collision of the particles of soluble coffee with the particles of the roasted coffee precursor within the milling chamber. Advantageously, comminuting the roasted coffee precursor in this manner has been found to provide an excellent means for reducing the particle size of the roasted coffee without the deleterious effects previously encountered by release of coffee oil from the roasted coffee precursor. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that the incorporation of the particles of soluble coffee into the milling chamber results in the soluble coffee absorbing some, and preferably most or all of the coffee oil released during comminution. Advantageously, the particles of soluble coffee are actively used as a comminuting agent within the milling chamber by impacting the particles of the roasted coffee precursor with the particles of soluble coffee. There will of course be some comminution of the roasted coffee precursor by self-collision—in other words, particles of roasted coffee precursor impacting other particles of roasted coffee precursor. However, it has been found that the additional comminution caused by impacting the roasted coffee precursor with particles of soluble coffee produces an enhanced milling action. This is particularly surprising considering that the particles of soluble coffee are not particularly hard. If preferred, the mobilised roasted coffee particles can be directed to impact additional surfaces, such as impact plates, of the milling chamber to provide additional comminution effects. However, the use of such impacts is not essential to the process. The particles of the roasted coffee precursor and the soluble coffee may be mixed together before introduction into the milling chamber. For example, the ingredients may be batch mixed in the dry form and introduced into the milling chamber via a common hopper feed. Alternatively the particles of the roasted coffee precursor and the soluble coffee may be introduced separately into the milling chamber. For example separate hoppers for the roasted coffee precursor and the soluble coffee precursor may be provided. Another possibility is the use of a single feed line which may be used to jet one precursor into the milling chamber which acts to entrain the other precursor into the flow. Preferably the particles of the roasted coffee precursor in step a) are at a temperature of between 5 and 30 degrees Celsius. Preferably the milling chamber is not subject to cryogenic cooling during steps b), c) and d). A particular advantage of the aspects of the present disclosure is that cryogenic cooling of the roasted coffee precursor to prevent coffee oil release is not required, even where the milling is down to colloidal particle sizes. The coffee precursor may optionally be subject to some pre-chilling before milling, for example by being refrigerated to a temperature as low as 5 degrees Celsius. However, the roasted coffee precursor may also be used at ambient temperature (typically 20 to 25 degrees Celsius). In addition, it is not essential that the physical components of the milling apparatus (chamber walls, feed lines, etc.) are cooled. However, it may be desirable to chill the jetting gas in order to help remove moisture during the milling process. The chilled gas will result in some cooling of the milling apparatus. However, this is significantly less than typically results during cryogenic cooling. The gas may be at a temperature between −20 degrees Celsius and ambient temperature. In one example gas at a temperature of −16 degrees Celsius was used. The absence of active cooling (or the use of minimal cooling as described above) considerably reduces the complexity of the machinery required for the milling process, speeds up the process time and reduces the costs associated with the milling stage of the process. Preferably the milled and blended coffee product produced in step d) comprises 10 to 80% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 20 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee. More preferably the milled and blended coffee product produced in step d) comprises 10 to 70% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 30 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee. Even more preferably the milled and blended coffee product produced in step d) comprises 15 to 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 50 to 85% by dry weight soluble coffee. In one example the milled and blended coffee product produced in step d) comprises 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 50% by dry weight soluble coffee. Milling to produce a product containing above 70% by dry weight roasted ground coffee may be made possible where the feed gas is chilled down to a temperature of around −20 degrees Celsius as discussed above. Otherwise limiting the percentage of roasted ground coffee in the product to a maximum of 70% is preferred. It will be appreciated that whilst the milled and blended coffee product has been described as comprising both roasted ground coffee and soluble coffee this does not preclude the possibility of the product also comprising additional components. Preferably in step d) the comminution results in the milled and blended coffee product having a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 40 microns. More preferably in step d) the comminution results in the milled and blended coffee product having a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 30 microns. The particles of roasted coffee precursor may be whole roasted coffee beans or coarsely-ground roasted coffee beans. The process finds application with whole roasted coffee beans which provides a simplified process route. However, if desired, an initial coarse grind of the roasted coffee beans can be carried out before the roasted coffee is inserted into the milling chamber. The particles of soluble coffee may be particles of spray-dried instant coffee, particles of freeze-dried instant coffee, or a mixture thereof. There may be advantages in using a soluble coffee type that matches the type of end product that the milled and blended coffee product is to be utilised in. For example, where ultimately the milled and blended coffee product is to be incorporated in a freeze-dried coffee product then the soluble coffee product used as a comminuting agent in the milling chamber may be chosen also to be freeze-dried soluble coffee. However, the types of soluble coffee used in the process may be mixed and altered as desired. Preferably the gas jetted into the milling chamber in step b) is nitrogen, air, or a mixture thereof. The milling chamber may form part of a jet mill. Examples of such mills include fluid bed opposed jet mills, Jet-O-Mizer™ mills, vortex mill, spiral mills, etc. The fourth aspect of the present disclosure extends to a milled and blended coffee product produced by the process described above. The milled and blended coffee product may be used as a milled and blended coffee intermediate in the processes of the second and third aspects of the present disclosure described above. Alternatively, the milled and blended coffee product may be used in the onward production of other coffee-based products. Further, the milled and blended coffee product may be packaged and sold as an end product in its own right. The present disclosure extends to a container containing the milled and blended coffee product described above or the soluble coffee product described above or the freeze-dried soluble coffee product described above. The container may be a bottle, a jar, a tin, a refill pack, a sachet, a stick pack, a filter bag or a container suitable for use in a beverage preparation machine such as a flexible pad formed at least partly from filtering material, or a rigid, semi-rigid or flexible cartridge formed from substantially air- and water-impermeable materials. The container may further contain one or more additional beverage components such as natural or artificial sweeteners, dairy or non-dairy based creamers, lactose, vegetable fat, whey proteins, emulsifiers, stabilisers, modified starches, carriers, fillers, flavours, colours, nutrients, preservatives, flow agents or foaming agents. The present disclosure extends to a beverage preparation machine in combination with at least one container suitable for use in said beverage preparation machine such as a flexible pad formed at least partly from filtering material, or a rigid, semi-rigid or flexible cartridge formed from substantially air- and water-impermeable materials, said at least one container containing the milled and blended coffee product described above or the soluble coffee product described above or the freeze-dried soluble coffee product described above. The present disclosure extends to method of making a beverage comprising the step of mixing the milled and blended coffee product described above or the soluble coffee product described above or the freeze-dried soluble coffee product described above with an aqueous liquid, preferably hot water. The mixing may be performed by a beverage preparation machine. Alternatively, the mixing may be by hand in a receptacle.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION In one aspect of the present disclosure a milled and blended coffee product may be produced by comminuting a roasted coffee precursor in a milling apparatus such as a jet mill. A suitable jet mill is the Jet-O-Mizer™ mill available from Fluid Energy Processing and Equipment Company, Telford, Pa., USA. Another suitable mill is the Hosokawa Alpine Fluid Bed Opposed Jet Mill—AFG, available from Hosakawa Micron Ltd, Runcorn, Cheshire, United Kingdom. Other suitable milling apparatus include mills referred to as spiral mills and vortex mills. A schematic illustration of the working principles of a jet mill is shown in FIG. 1. The mill 1 comprises a milling chamber 2 having a feed inlet 3 , a series of gas inlets 4 , a size classification wheel 8 and a product outlet 5 . The milling chamber 2 of FIG. 1 takes the form of a generally cylindrical body having the gas inlets 4 at a lower end and spaced around the periphery and the product outlet 5 located near an upper end. The feed inlet 3 communicates with the milling chamber 2 to allow ingredient precursor(s), in the form of whole or coarsely-ground roasted coffee beans and soluble coffee particles, to be fed into the milling chamber 2 tangentially at a location at or near the chamber periphery. The size classification wheel 8 is located near the upper end of the milling chamber 2 and is adapted to received comminuted particles from the chamber 2 and pass those under a desired particle size to the product outlet 5 . The roasted coffee precursor and the soluble coffee precursor are dry batch mixed at the required ratio and then deposited in a hopper which communicates with the feed inlet 3 as shown schematically in FIG. 1 by arrow A. A feed gas supply may be provided to entrain the precursors from the hopper and convey them to the chamber 2 . Compressed gas is supplied in use to the plurality of gas inlets 4 . The gas inlets 4 are orientated at an angle to the radial direction of the chamber 2 —preferably tangentially to the chamber 2 —such that flow of gas through the gas inlets 4 sets up a swirling, spiralling gas flow within the chamber 2 . In use, to comminute the roasted coffee precursor, the precursors are fed into the chamber 2 and mobilised in the chamber 2 by the high speed flow of gas entering the chamber 2 through the gas inlets 4 (and also the feed gas (where used) entering with the precursors through the feed inlet 3 ). Comminution occurs due to the high velocity collisions between the particles of roasted coffee precursor and the soluble coffee resulting in pulverisation of the roasted coffee precursor. As the particle size reduces the smaller particle sizes move up the chamber 2 into the size classification wheel 8 . The size classification wheel 8 acts to classify the particles it receives and pass onward to the product outlet 5 those particles less than a desired particle size. The particles exit the mill as shown schematically in FIG. 1 by arrow B. The larger particles are retained in the chamber and are subject to further comminution. Thus, the jet mill also helps to classify the particle size output through the product outlet 5 . Depending on the type of jet mill, the orientation and configuration of the milling chamber 2 , gas inlets 4 , and product outlet 5 can be altered. The gas supplied to the gas inlets 4 and the feed gas for conveying the roasted coffee precursor into the chamber 2 may be air, but is preferably an inert gas, such as nitrogen. The feed gas may be dehumidified and/or chilled in order to help remove moisture from the chamber 2 generated during milling. Dehumidification may be, for example, by use of a desiccant- or compressor-based dehumidifier. In addition, or alternatively, the gas supplied to the gas inlets 4 may be chilled. The roasted coffee precursor may be whole roasted coffee beans or alternatively may be coffee beans that have been coarsely ground using a conventional milling process to have a particle size of greater than 100 microns. The soluble coffee may be a spray-dried or freeze-dried instant coffee product. The particle size of the soluble coffee product before jet milling is typically between 100 and 350 microns for spray-dried soluble coffee and 0.1 to 3.5 mm for freeze-dried soluble coffee. It is not necessary for the mill 1 to be subjected to cryogenic cooling prior or during the milling process. Rather, the mill 1 is preferably operated at substantially the ambient temperatures existing at the location where the mill 1 is situated. As noted above, the feed gas and/or gas supplied to the gas inlets may optionally be chilled which may result in a modicum of cooling of the apparatus components. For example it has been found that the throughput of the jet mill may be beneficially increased by using cool gas supplied to the gas inlets 4 , for example to a temperature of −16 degrees Celsius, in particular where the ratio of dry weight of roasted ground coffee to dry weight soluble coffee in the milled and blended coffee product is greater than 50%. In particular this may allow the percentage by dry weight of the roasted ground coffee in the mix to be up to 80%. The following results were achieved using a Roto-Jet 15 mill available from Fluid Energy Processing and Equipment Company, Telford, Pa., USA. The mill was fed with 100% Arabica beans roasted to 8 La. The pressure to the gas inlets 4 was 7 bar and the supplied gas was desiccated air which was cooled to +5 degrees Celsius for the first sample and −16 degrees Celsius for the second sample. For both samples the classifier of the jet mill was controlled to produce a particle size distribution D90 of 30 microns. Ratio of roasted Equivalent ground roast & coffee to Total ground coffee soluble Grinding Throughput throughput coffee Mill Air Temp (kg/hr) kg/hr 70/30 Fluid bed Jet- +5° C. 20.9 14.6 Mill 70/30 Fluid bed Jet- −16° C. 68.2 47.7 Mill As can be seen, use of an air temperature of −16 degrees Celsius results in a significant increase in the throughput of the jet mill while still maintaining the required particle size distribution. However, it is to be noted that this is still a relatively high temperature compared to prior art cryogenic cooling processes and it is to be noted that the roasted coffee precursor and soluble coffee are not subject to cryogenic cooling before entering the jet mill. The roasted coffee precursor is not subjected to cryogenic cooling or any cryogenic pre-treatment prior to milling. Typically, the temperature of the roasted coffee precursor when filled into the hopper 6 will be in the range 5 to 30° C. The roasted coffee precursor may be at the ambient room temperature of the milling apparatus. The milled and blended coffee product obtained from product outlet 5 comprises 20 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee and 10 to 80% by dry weight roasted ground coffee. Preferably the milled and blended coffee product obtained from product outlet 5 comprises 30 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee and 10 to 70% by dry weight roasted ground coffee. More preferably the milled and blended coffee product comprises 50 to 85% by dry weight soluble coffee and 15 to 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee. In one example the milled and blended coffee product comprises 50% by dry weight soluble coffee and 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee. After milling, the milled and blended coffee product has a particle size distribution with a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 40 microns, more preferably less than or equal to 30 microns. EXAMPLES FIG. 2 shows results for the dry Helos particle size distribution D90 (and in addition wet Helos figures) for milled and blended coffee products produced according to the present disclosure as a function of the dry weight percentage of roasted ground coffee present. As can be seen, from 10 to 70% of roasted ground coffee the dry Helos particle size distribution D90 is less than or equal to 40 microns. Above 70% roasted ground coffee the dry Helos particle size distribution D90 increases deleteriously. (As noted above, this may be ameliorated by chilling the feed gas to the jet mill). At or below 50% roasted ground coffee a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of 30 microns or less is achievable. In a separate example, a blend of Brazilian and Columbian Arabica beans was roasted to a colour of 11.5 La and pre-ground to a D50 of 500 microns. The resulting roasted coffee precursor was dry batch mixed with Arabica spray-dried coffee at a ratio of 50% roasted coffee precursor to 50% spray-dried coffee precursor. The resultant blend was then milled in a Hosokawa Alpine Fluid Bed Opposed Jet Mill—AFG at a variety of feed rates and classifiers speeds. The following results were obtained: Classifier Feed Rate Speed Run time Dry Helos Dry Helos (kg/hour) (RPM) (mins.) D50 D90 120 2350 30 10.5 27.5 50 2000 38 11.4 28.7 50 2000 60 11.0 27.2 Advantageously, as can be seen for each example a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than 30 microns was obtainable at a range of feed rates and classifier speeds. Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to processes for producing novel soluble instant coffee products incorporating a milled and blended coffee product containing a percentage of roasted ground coffee. Prior art processes for forming spray-dried and freeze-dried soluble coffee both start with the steps of producing a coffee concentrate intermediate from coffee beans by the processes of roasting and extraction. FIG. 3 illustrates the stages involved. Green coffee beans are roasted and then ground before being added to water to extract the coffee bean constituents. Optionally, coffee aroma may be stripped at this point to produce a liquid aroma product. The extraction liquid is then concentrated, for example in percolation columns to produce a concentrated extract, commonly known as coffee liquor. Optionally, at this point the previously produced aroma product may be incorporated to produce an aromatised coffee concentrate intermediate. Such processes are well known. The remainder of the procedure depends on whether the soluble product is to be spray-dried or freeze-dried. For spray-dried soluble coffee the remaining process steps include foaming, filtering and homogenising and spray drying to produce the spray-dried product. For freeze-dried soluble coffee the remaining process steps include foaming and pre-freezing, freezing, grinding & sieving and vacuum drying. According to the present disclosure these known processes are adapted by the incorporation of a milled and blended coffee intermediate containing a percentage of roasted ground coffee. In each of the processes described below, the milled and blended coffee intermediate itself may contain 10 to 80% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 20 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee. Preferably, the milled and blended coffee intermediate contains 10 to 70% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 30 to 90% by dry weight soluble coffee. More preferably, the milled and blended coffee intermediate contains 15 to 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 50 to 85% by dry weight soluble coffee. In one example the milled and blended coffee intermediate comprises 50% by dry weight soluble coffee and 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee. The soluble coffee component of the milled and blended coffee intermediate in any of the processes below may be derived from spray-dried instant coffee, freeze-dried instant coffee, or a mixture thereof. The milled and blended coffee intermediate preferably has a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 40 microns, more preferably less than or equal to 30 microns. In each of the processes described below the end coffee product may comprise 5 to 30% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 70 to 95% by dry weight equivalent of soluble coffee. (For example, a soluble coffee end product containing 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee can be obtained by mixing the liquid coffee concentrate with a dry milled and blended coffee intermediate having 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 50% by dry weight soluble coffee in a ratio of 70:30 coffee concentrate intermediate to milled and blended coffee intermediate. In a preferred option, the milled and blended coffee intermediate is produced using the novel process of the present disclosure described above with reference to FIG. 1. However, milled and blended coffee intermediates having the requisite percentages of roasted ground coffee and soluble coffee may be used, even where produced by alternative means. FIG. 4 a shows a first freeze-dried process for forming a freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 . A coffee concentrate intermediate 20 (aromatised or non-aromatised) is mixed with a milled and blended coffee intermediate 30 using a high shear mixer 50 prior to the foaming and pre-freezing step 21 . Suitable mixers include high shear batch mixers and high shear in-line mixers available from Silverson Machines Ltd, Chesham, United Kingdom. The mixture is then foamed and pre-frozen at step 21 and then fed to a belt freezer 22 for a further freezing step. The frozen intermediate is then ground and sieved at step 23 to produce a particle size range of 0.3 to 3.5 mm, preferably 0.3 to 2.5 mm, more preferably 0.3 to 1.5 mm. The intermediate is then vacuum dried at step 24 to produce the freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 . The product may then be packed in a container. A modification to the process of FIG. 4 a is shown in FIG. 4 b . The process is as described above with reference to FIG. 4 a up to step 22 . At step 23 , however, the frozen intermediate is ground and sieved to produce a larger particle size range of 1.0 to 3.5 mm. The intermediate is then vacuum dried at step 24 to produce an intermediate freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 a . At step 26 the intermediate freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 a is subject to a secondary grinding to reduce the particle size range to 0.3 to 1.5 mm to produce the freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 . The product may then be packed in a container. FIG. 5 a shows a second freeze-dried process for forming a freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 . The process is the same as the first process described above with reference to FIG. 4 a with the exception that the milled and blended coffee product 30 is incorporated after the foaming and pre-freezing step 21 . Again, a high shear mixer 50 of the type described above may be used and in other respects the process is the same as the first process. A modification to the process of FIG. 5 a is shown in FIG. 5 b . The process is as described above with reference to FIG. 5 a up to step 22 . At step 23 , however, the frozen intermediate is ground and sieved to produce a larger particle size range of 1.0 to 3.5 mm. The intermediate is then vacuum dried at step 24 to produce an intermediate freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 a . At step 26 the intermediate freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 a is subject to a secondary grinding to reduce the particle size range to 0.3 to 1.5 mm to produce the freeze-dried soluble coffee product 25 . The product may then be packed in a container. An advantage of the modified processes of FIGS. 4 b and 5 b is that the particle size during vacuum drying is larger than in the processes of FIGS. 4 a and 5 a which has been found to lead to less product losses during drying. It has been found that with the processes of FIGS. 4 a and 5 a potential product losses occur when vacuum drying very small particle sizes due to the particles being carried off along with the evaporating water content of the intermediate. A further advantage of each of the freeze-drying processes of the present disclosure described above is that it has been surprisingly found that a better freeze-drying performance is achieved and a higher concentration of soluble solids can be incorporated in the product prior to freeze drying where finely milled roasted ground coffee is included. The term ‘freeze-drying performance’ refers to the avoidance of dried product quality problems, specifically melt-back and sticky lumps. ‘Melt-back’ refers to the failure to remove water from each granule structure by sublimation during freeze drying, and ‘sticky lumps’ arise from the failure to remove water vapour that has sublimated from individual granules from the overall coffee bed tray. A typical freeze drying process involves freezing of foamed coffee extract on a cold room belt. When frozen, the coffee slab is granulated and sieved to a particular granule size before drying in a freeze-dryer. The capacity of a freeze dryer is limited by its de-watering ability. The amount of water in the frozen coffee particles fed to the freeze-drier is dependent on the concentration of total coffee solids of the liquid coffee extract when it is frozen. The higher the coffee solids concentration the lower the water content and thus the freeze-drier requires less utilisation of its capacity to remove that water. Therefore for a given de-watering ability of a freeze-drier one might attempt to increase product throughput by increasing the solids concentration fed to the dryer. However, increasing the concentration has previously been found to have a detrimental effect on product quality such as melt back of product and production of sticky lumps of agglomerated granules. Because of this limitation, it has been previously accepted that the feed extract should contain no more than about 50% total coffee solids. However, according to the processes and products of the present disclosure it has been found that total coffee solids concentrations of up to 63% can be fed to a freeze-drier while avoiding melt-back and sticky lumps. For example, superior extracts of 56% and 60% concentration may be formed with 15% (by dry weight) of finely milled roasted ground coffee, with a particle size D50 of 30 to 40 microns and a D99 of below 60 microns, and 85% (by dry weight) of pure soluble coffee solids. EXAMPLES To illustrate the improved drying performance and product qualities, the following freeze-dried samples were prepared. In each case, the base extract was prepared by re-dissolving freeze-dried granules and adding water to make the required concentration of coffee solids. Drying was carried out under the same conditions for all samples: the dryer was a Rayl model available from GEA Niro, of Soeborg, Denmark; samples were dried in a standard tray with the heating profile, initial product weight, particle size of feed material to dryer being identical. Sample 1-1 (Comparative) The final extract had a coffee solids concentration of 56% (exclusively pure soluble coffee solids) and was foamed by air, frozen, grinded, sieved between 0.7 mm-3.35 mm sizes, and finally vacuum dried. Ice coffee granules were frozen at −40 degrees C. and vacuum dried for 3.0 hrs or 3.4 hrs.

Ice coffee granules were frozen at −40 degrees C. and vacuum dried for 3.0 hrs or 3.4 hrs. Frozen and grinded coffee granules Dry product after before drying freeze-drying Water (%) 44 0 Soluble coffee 48 85 solids (%) Insoluble coffee 8 15 solids (%) The presence of sticky lumps was quantified by sieving using a 3.35 mm size sieve, with the following results: Sample 1-1 (Comparative) Sample 2-1 Feed to Dryer 56% 56% 56% 56% concentration (%) Drying time (Hrs) 3.4 3.0 3.4 3.0 Stickied Free flow of clumps clumps yes yes granules product from tray Quantity (%) 60.9 65.9 0.4 0.1 Physical Density 21.5 22.3 21.6 21.9 quality (g/100 ml) As can be seen the inclusion of finely milled roasted ground coffee substantially eliminates the presence of sticky lumps. As well as comparison by sieving, direct visual comparison was made by scanning electron microscope (SEM) photographs. FIG. 12 shows SEM photographs of the dried coffee products of Sample 1-1. while FIG. 13 shows SEM photographs of the dried coffee products of Sample 2-1. As can be seen from the photos, Samples 2-1 containing finely milled roasted ground coffee show fewer collapsed areas in their structure compared to pure soluble solids Samples 1-1. Samples 1-2 (Comparative) The final extract had a coffee solids concentration of 60%, (exclusively pure soluble coffee solids) and was foamed by air, frozen, grinded, sieved between 0.7 mm-3.35 mm sizes and finally vacuum dried.

As can be seen from the photos, Sample 2-2 containing finely milled roasted ground coffee shows fewer collapsed areas in structure compared to Sample 1-2. As another, separate benefit it has been found that the grinding of frozen coffee extract, which contains finely milled roasted ground coffee produces improved grinding performance in that fewer fines are generated compared to frozen coffee extracts formed from pure soluble coffee: Frozen coffee chips Product (0.7-3.335 mm) Fines (below 0.7 mm) 56% concentration 80% 20% with finely milled roasted ground coffee 56% concentration 75% 25% without finely milled roasted ground coffee 60% concentration 79% 21% with finely milled roasted ground coffee 60% concentration 75% 25% without finely milled roasted ground coffee For the grinding, the same machine, process and parameters were used: Grinder screen 8 mm, sieve screen 0.7-3.35 mm FIG. 6 shows a first spray-dried process for forming a spray-dried soluble coffee product 44 . A coffee concentrate intermediate 20 (aromatised or non-aromatised) is mixed with a milled and blended coffee intermediate 30 using a high shear mixer 50 prior to the foaming step 41 . A high shear mixer 50 of the type described above may be used. The mixture is then foamed at step 41 and then filtered and optionally homogenised at step 42 . The intermediate is then spray dried at step 43 to produce the spray-dried soluble coffee product 44 . The product may then be packed in a container. FIG. 7 shows a second spray-dried process for forming a spray-dried soluble coffee product 44 . The process is the same as the first spray-dried process described above with the exception that the milled and blended coffee product 30 is incorporated into a dry mix. In particular, the spray-drying apparatus (as known in the art) comprises a fines collector for recycling coffee powder fines. At step 51 , the milled and blended coffee intermediate 30 is fed into the recycling line from the fines collector and is therefore incorporated into the product during the spray-drying stage. It has been found that the milled and blended coffee intermediate formed by jet milling has very good dispersion characteristics in liquids (such as hot water or concentrated liquid coffee extract). EXAMPLES To illustrate the beneficial dispersion qualities of the jet milled and blended coffee intermediate, the following samples were prepared as follows: Sample 1 (Comparative) 100% Arabica beans, roasted to colour 8.5 La, then cryogenically ground using prior art techniques. 15% by dry weight of the resultant ground material was then dry mixed by hand with 85% of Arabica-based dried soluble coffee—end composition 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee, 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. Sample 2 15% Arabica beans roasted to colour 8.5 La, then jet milled with 85% Arabica-based, dried soluble coffee—end composition 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee, 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. Sample 3 30% Arabica beans roasted to colour 8.5 La, then jet milled with 70% Arabica-based, dried soluble coffee to form blended intermediate. 50% by dry weight of blended intermediate dry mixed by hand with 50% by dry weight of Arabica-based dried soluble coffee—end composition 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee, 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. Sample 4 50% Arabica beans roasted to colour 8.5 La, then jet milled with 50% Arabica-based, dried soluble coffee to form blended intermediate. 30% by dry weight of blended intermediate dry mixed by hand with 70% by dry weight of Arabica-based dried soluble coffee—end composition 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee, 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. Beverages were then prepared from the samples and dry and wet Helos (with and without ultrasound) particle size distributions were measured, with the following results: % roasted ground coffee:% Wet Helos - Wet Helos - soluble Dry Helos Stirred D90 Ultrasound Sample coffee D90 μm μm D90 μm 1 15:85 27.2 69.4 22.1 2 15:85 10.5 28.5 17.8 3 15:85 17.4 35.6 23.1 4 15:85 27.2 60.7 29.8 Wet Helos of the stirred sample represents the particle size when first made up and is higher where there is poor dispersion of the finely ground roasted coffee particles in water, thereby forming “clumps” of material. That clumps are formed can be determined by comparing to the Wet Helos with ultrasound measurement. The ultrasound acts to break up the clumps (if present). As can be seen from the results, the comparative Sample 1 formed with cryogenically-ground roasted coffee had poor dispersion characteristics and significant clumping—verified by the large difference between the wet Helos figures with and without ultrasound—even though the product had the same total roasted ground coffee content as Samples 2 to 4. By comparison, Samples 2 and 3 of the present disclosure have much better dispersion where the milled and blended coffee intermediate has 15 or 30% by dry weight roasted ground coffee. Sample 4 with 50% by dry weight roasted ground coffee shows some improvement over the prior art composition but less than Samples 2 and 3. Another aspect of the present disclosure relates to a novel freeze-dried soluble coffee product having an appearance reminiscent of roasted ground coffee. It has been surprisingly discovered that the addition of roasted ground coffee of small particle size to a freeze-dried soluble coffee product can produce a darkening of the end product that results in the freeze-dried product looking more similar to roasted ground coffee than prior art freeze-dried coffee products. The roasted ground coffee particles are preferably colloidal in size with a dry Helos particle size distribution D90 of less than or equal to 100 microns, preferably less than or equal to 50 microns, more preferably less than or equal to 30 microns. The roasted ground coffee may constitute 5 to 30% by dry weight of the freeze-dried product. The roasted ground coffee may be derived from cryogenic milling of whole roasted coffee beans. However, preferably, the roasted ground coffee is obtained by the milling process of the present disclosure described above with reference to FIG. 1 in which the roasted ground coffee is a component of the milled and blended coffee intermediate. The roasted ground coffee may be incorporated into the product by high shear mixing. Preferably, where the milled and blended coffee intermediate of the present disclosure is to be used, the roasted ground coffee is incorporated using one of the processes described above with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. The freeze-dried coffee end product has a colour of 13 to 30 La units on the Lange scale, preferably 16 to 25 La units, more preferably 17 to 20 La units. The density of the soluble coffee product also has an affect on the colour. Typically the denser the product the darker the colour. However, it is undesirable to have a soluble product that is too dense. Hence the present disclosure provides a flexible alternative which can be used separately from (or in combination with) control of the density of the product to select the desired product colour. FIG. 8 illustrates results for a first set of three sample products, A to C. For all three samples A to C the total solids (soluble coffee solids and roasted ground coffee solids where applicable) concentration of the product fed to the freeze-drier was 50% and the drying time was 3.37 hours. Samples A to C had the following characteristics: Sample A (Comparative Example) Standard Net Robusta concentrated extract was foamed and freeze-dried using known prior art techniques without the inclusion of any roasted ground coffee. The datum colour change of 0 is set for a density of Sample A of 210 g/l. An increased density of 220 g/l results in a colour change of −1.5 La units. An increased density of 230 g/l results in a colour change of −2.7 La units. Sample B A freeze-dried product according to the process of FIG. 5 a with roasted ground coffee added after foaming with the end product comprising 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. Compared to Sample A, Sample B produced a darker product with a colour change of −3.0 La units at a density of 210 g/l; −3.8 La units at a density of 220 g/l. Sample C A freeze-dried product according to the process of FIG. 4 a with roasted ground coffee added before foaming with the end product comprising 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee. Compared to Sample A, Sample C produced a darker product with a colour change of −1.5 La units at a density of 210 g/l; −2.4 La units at a density of 220 g/l and −3.4 La units at a density of 230 g/l. The results may be tabulated as follows: Color change from datum Sample Density (g/l) (La) A 210 0 A 220 −1.5 A 230 −2.7 B 210 −3.0 B 220 −3.8 C 210 −1.5 C 220 −2.4 C 230 −3.4 The following table illustrate results for a second set of two sample groups of products D and E subjected to differing solids concentrations and drying times. Sample groups D and E had the following characteristics: Sample D (Comparative Example) Standard Net Arabica concentrated extract was foamed and freeze-dried without the inclusion of any roasted ground coffee. The datum colour change of 0 was set for a density of sample of 220 g/l for three conditions; feed to dryer solids concentration of 56% with 3 hrs drying time, feed to dryer solids concentration of 60% with 3 hrs drying time and feed to dryer solids concentration of 56% with 3.37 hrs drying time. Sample E A freeze-dried product according to the process of FIG. 4 a with roasted ground coffee added before foaming with the end product comprising 15% by dry weight roasted ground coffee and 85% by dry weight equivalent soluble coffee and a density of 220 g/l. The same three conditions as Sample D were evaluated. Total solids concentration Color change from Sample fed to dryer (%) Drying time (Hrs) datum (La) D 56 3.0 0 E 56 3.0 −11.05 D 60 3.0 0 E 60 3.0 −7.45 D 56 3.37 0 E 56 3.37 −9.35 As can be seen from the data above, the inclusion of the roasted ground coffee produces a marked darkening of the end product compared to a pure soluble coffee product. It has also been found that the freeze-dried product is more reminiscent of roasted ground coffee where it is ground at step 23 to a particle size of 0.3 to 3.5 mm, preferably 0.3 to 2.5 mm, more preferably 0.3 to 1.5 mm. The milled and blended coffee product described above or the soluble coffee product described above or the freeze-dried soluble coffee product described above may be packaged for sale in a container such as a jar 101 as shown in FIG. 9. Alternatively, the milled and blended coffee product or the soluble coffee product or the freeze-dried soluble coffee product may be packaged in a container suitable for use in a beverage preparation machine. For example, FIG. 10 shows a suitable container in the form of a cartridge 102 that may be used in a beverage preparation machine 103 as shown in FIG. 11. The product may contain one or more additional beverage components such as natural or artificial sweeteners, dairy or non-dairy based creamers, lactose, vegetable fat, whey proteins, emulsifiers, stabilisers, modified starches, carriers, fillers, flavours, colours, nutrients, preservatives, flow agents or foaming agents.","9357791"

No. 12/247,232, filed Oct. 8, 2008, which is assigned to the same assignee as the subject patent application and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The disclosures herein relate generally to the preparation of beverages for consumption, and more particularly, to brewing beverages such as coffee. BACKGROUND Quality standards in the specialty coffee industry established during the 1950's and 1960's that coffee extraction of approximately 20% (usually a range of ˜18-22%) will achieve the best quality brewed coffee, using various brew methods. Over the ensuing years these established standards have been generally referred to as the gold-cup standard, and have been accepted internationally by many institutions, educational establishments, and standards committees. The precise extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration) may be varied for particular coffees, to achieve finely tuned recipes for particular coffee cultivars, climates and growing regions, also known as terroir, and other characteristics. Extraction (solubles yield) refers to the percentage of the dry coffee by weight that is removed by dissolving in water during the brewing process. Up to 30% of the available soluble solids in ground coffee can be extracted, with most of the remaining 70% being cellulose, and not soluble in water. However, generally speaking, extracting more than 22% will begin to sharply increase those components in coffee that contribute to the bitter taste defects associated with over-extraction. Extracting less than 18% is generally associated with weak, under-developed taste defects. The finished brew is a balance between extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration). Over-extracting results in the extraction of many of the bitter components of the remaining solids. These contribute significantly to those taste defects known as bitter, strong-bitter and weak bitter. Under-extracting causes a taste defect that is under-developed and can be weakly or strongly under-developed. As coffee dissolves, the bulk of the solids including the sweeter components dissolve during the first 30-50% of the brewing cycle, and the more bitter elements start to dissolve in the latter half of the brewing cycle. The highest quality coffee will have rich aroma, fullness of body, delicacy of flavor as well as clarity and unique character—all optimally balanced. Achieving these attributes requires a significant degree of precision during the coffee brewing process. Strength (solubles concentration) refers to the measured amount of solids extracted into the final coffee solution. Strength may be expressed as the percentage total dissolved solids (% TDS). For example, for 100 grams of a coffee measuring 1.3% TDS, there are 98.7 grams of water, and 1.3 grams of dissolved coffee solids in solution. Refractive index measurements have been used for process control in the food industry since the 1940s. Typical measurements are usually for sugars in fruits such as melons, for orange and other juices, for sugar content in grapes for the wine industry, and many other examples. SUMMARY Accordingly, in one embodiment a method of brewing coffee is disclosed. The method includes receiving, by an information handling system (IHS), first input information that specifies a coffee design mode. The method also includes receiving, by the IHS, second input information. The method further includes defining, by the IHS, a brew formula line that exhibits a unitless brew formula ratio of water weight to coffee weight in response to the second input information. The method still further includes displaying, by a display of the IHS, a brew formula line on a universal brewing control chart graph, the brew formula line being dependent on the brew formula ratio. In another embodiment, a computer program product is disclosed. The computer program product includes instructions that receive first input information that specifies a coffee design mode. The computer program product also includes instructions that receive second input information. The computer program product also includes instructions that define a brew formula line that exhibits a unitless brew formula ratio of water weight to coffee weight in response to the second input information. The computer program product further includes instructions that display a brew formula line on a universal brewing control chart graph on a display, the brew formula line being dependent on the brew formula ratio. In yet another embodiment, an information handling system (IHS) is disclosed. The IHS includes a processor. The IHS also includes a display coupled to the processor. The IHS further includes a memory coupled to the processor. The memory is configured with a coffee design application that receives first input information that specifies a coffee design mode. The coffee design application also receives second input information.

FIG. 11B is a flowchart that depicts process steps in operating the disclosed coffee refractometer to read the TDS of a coffee brew sample. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a prior original brewing chart that shows soluble solids vs. brew formula as a function of extraction percent, namely 5-40 percent as seen in the upper left of the chart (CBC Publication No. 27, 1969, p 12.). The y axis represents soluble solids concentration (strength) in percent while the x axis represents the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. Hyperbolic curves representing soluble solids yield extraction in percent from 5-40% are illustrated. Of particular interest in this series of hyperbolas are region of interest 105 and the smaller region of interest 110 . Region of interest 105 relates to a study carried out by the Brewing Committee of the National Coffee Association, which judged brews prepared within this region for objective acceptability. The Midwest Research Institute carried out a more recent independent study from which it was concluded that the most acceptable coffee would result from preparation within the more refined region of interest 110 , for soluble solids concentration (strength) from 1.15 to 1.35 percent and soluble solids yield extraction between 18 and 22 percent (Niven, W. W., Jr. and Shaw, B. C., Critical Conditions for Quality Coffee Brewing, Coffee and Tea Industries 80, No. 4, 44, April, 1957. Tea and Coffee Trade Journal, 112, No. 4, 28-Apr. 1957. Coffee Brewing Center, Nos. 19 and 27, 1969. The brewing chart of FIG. 1 signifies that a very small area of the curves thereof (i.e. region of interest 105 or region of interest 110 ) should be targeted for proper coffee extraction relative to the wide range of extraction possible. FIG. 2 is an enlargement of a portion of the brewing chart of FIG. 1 focusing on regions of interest 105 and 110 . FIG. 3 is a conventional representation of the data for FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 including solubles concentration (strength) vs. solubles yield (extraction) with brew formula as the parameter. More particularly, the y axis of FIG. 3 represents extracted solids in solution (percent TDS or total dissolved solids) while the x axis represents extraction in ounces per pound (solubles yield). The plotted curves are nearly straight lines (curves) that correspond to the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. The plot of FIG. 3 identifies a substantially centered rectangular region of interest 305 as representing the ideal coffee brew. This region of interest 305 is the same as originally published by the CBC and as identified as developed by the Midwest Research Institute, region 110 , previously in FIGS. 1 and 2. These plots assume the specific gravity of water at ambient temperature which may in fact be substantially different from the specific gravity of water at the actual brewing temperature. This assumption may have a negative impact on the brewing process and may affect the ability to reach a particular target percent of TDS of coffee in solution and a particular percent extraction if the ratio of coffee to water is determined at an incorrect temperature. Since the density of water changes as a function of temperature, the volume of water to weight of coffee ratios are affected accordingly. To further illustrate this problem, commercial brewer-extractors are typically preset to approximately 200 degrees F. and volume is calibrated at the boiler set point, whereas a home brewer typically uses water at tap or room temperature, i.e. an ambient temperature of approximately 50-65 degrees F. The volume of a given weight of water at room temperature will be significantly less than the volume of the same weight of water at 200 degrees F., because water is more dense at ambient than at 200 degrees. This scenario can lead to inaccurate brewing results when using the coffee brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIG. 4A is substantially the same coffee control brewing chart of FIG. 3 except that the x axis is now expressed in percent extraction, a more convenient unitless method of expression, instead of ounces extracted per pound of coffee. For example, if 3.2 ounces of coffee are extracted from 16 ounces of coffee, this corresponds to 20% extraction by weight. While the parameters of the x axis and y axis are expressed in percent, the brew formula of FIG. 4A remains in units of gallons of water per pound of coffee, as was the case in the brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIGS. 4B-4E show a similar conventional representation of the typical brewing chart in common use today. For each brew batch size and unit of measure, separate conventional representations are needed, where such representations show separate brew formulas each labelled for the weight of ground coffee called for in that dedicated batch size. FIGS. 4B-4E show separate charts required for each separate batch size, and units of measure used, including gallons of brew water per ounce of ground coffee, similarly half-gallons per ounce, liters per gram and quarts per ounce. Expressed alternatively, FIG. 4B is a conventional brewing chart for grams coffee per liter water. FIG. 4C is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 gallon water. FIG. 4D is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per half gallon water. FIG. 4E is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 quart water. FIG. 5 shows the universal coffee brewing chart that the disclosed coffee design software application may generate. Rectangle 505 denotes a region of interest of acceptable strength in percent total dissolved solids (% TDS or solubles concentration) and extraction percent (solubles yield) that are found to be very desirable for the experienced palate, typically from approx. 1.2% to approx. 1.4% strength and approx. 19% to approx. 21% extraction, more typically from approx. 1.15% to approx. 1.55% strength and approx. 18% to approx. 22% extraction. Such regions of interest may be defined specifically as being best suited for particular coffee cultivars, regions, roast styles, and terroir, and may be developed specifically as preferences or suggested recipes for brewing particular coffees, and may be further developed as a result of consumer taste profiles and overlaid as new regions of interest to suit a particular consumer preference, roaster preference or user preference. For example, consumer preferences may be plotted on an additional z-scale, and consider an n-point scale (from “like intensely” to “dislike intensely”) which is plotted as a three-dimensional surface chart, where the y-scale is solubles concentration (%) and the X-scale is solubles yield (%). The surface chart may then be resolved to a colorized two-dimensional chart by viewing the three-dimensional chart from the top, and plotting the z-axis (consumer preference) in colors and in two dimensions, along with the traditional solubles yield (percent extraction) and solubles concentration (percent TDS, strength) superimposed on the same two-dimensional chart. Such a representation may provide an update to the most recent “optimum balance” regions of interest, and as corrected for brew water temperature. Brew formula line 510 represents the brew formula of water and coffee and makes the brew formula a dimensionless unit of measure by stating brew formula as a ratio (e.g. 17.19) of water to coffee by weight. This ratio remains constant despite variations in size of coffee batches brewed or the units used, thereby eliminating a requisite of separate brewing control charts for each different unit of measure or changes in batch size, as required in the past with conventional brewing control charts. Unfortunately, the conventional brewing control charts of FIGS. 1-3, 4 A- 4 E are not flexible because a different brewing control chart is needed each time brewing batch size or units of measure changes. Moreover in these conventional charts, mixed units of volume of water are used with weight measurement units of coffee, mandating a new chart whenever a unit of measure or batch size changed. However, in one embodiment, the disclosed coffee design application and system is capable of generating a universal coffee brewing control chart that is stepless in portion sizes and continuous as coffee batch size, brew formulas, extraction and strength changes and as other variables change. The universal coffee brewing control chart also manages variable and mixed units, for example, brew water may be specified in gallons and coffee weight in grams, or water in liters and coffee weight in ounces. The disclosed coffee design application converts water volume at the temperature specified to weight to plot the correct brew formula ratio. Previous original brewing charts assumed water at room temperature, and conventional charts assumed water at 140 degrees F. as corrected for the hydrometer instrument used. However, the disclosed coffee design application corrects for the actual brew water temperature. The disclosed coffee design application will replot the control chart steplessly and in real time as the user changes design inputs. For example, as brew strength increases, brew formula line 505 may be continuously replotted to the left and higher in FIG. 5. Likewise, as brew strength decreases, brew formula line 505 may shift continuously to the right and lower in FIG. 5. With each change in the brew formula line, all other design output parameters are calculated and displayed continuously and in real time, and portions are determined based on actual start and brew water temperatures to maintain portions true to the brew formula ratio, eliminating previous errors in the range of 2-4%. With the universal coffee brew control chart that this application provides, there is no need for a series of different brew control charts for each batch size or units of measure. The following EQUATION 1 determines Percent Extraction using the Brew Formula Ratio, Water Density at Brew Temp and Percent TDS as variables. More particularly, from TDS %=0 to TDS %=10, the disclosed coffee design application determines Extraction for each TDS point using EQUATION 1: EXTRACTION %=(BF Ratio−water density_(g/ml@brew Temp)*waterLost_ml/g_coffee)/(1/TDS %−0.01))   EQUATION 1 To calculate Extraction % using this equation, Brew Formula Ratio (BF Ratio) should first be determined from the user input using the Strength Slider (TDS %) setting and the Target Extraction %. If the user changes the Strength Slider, then the BF Ratio changes and the brew formula line moves to a new location on the brew chart. Water density at brew temperature and water lost per gram are constants. Equation 1 is not a linear equation. The disclosed coffee design application plots the resulting point pairs on the control chart of FIG. 5 to draw the brew formula line 510 . The brew formula line 510 is drawn from generated data point pairs by incrementing Percent TDS from 0 to 10 and calculating Percent Extraction. The universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction, namely change in TDS over change in extraction. The Brew Formula is used to calculate these point pairs. As will be explained in more detail below, the disclosed coffee design application will plot the intended coffee design as a small circle 515 (red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . Subsequently, after brewing a sample batch of coffee according to the specified design parameters and measuring the total dissolved (TDS %) with the disclosed coffee refractometer, the disclosed coffee application will plot the actual measured coffee design as a large circle 520 (blue plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . FIG. 6A shows an information handling system 600 on which the coffee design application may execute as a computer program product. More particularly, FIG. 6 shows an information handling system (IHS) 600 that includes coffee design application 602 and an operating system 606 . IHS 600 may initially store coffee design application 602 as a computer program product on a non-transitory medium 608 , such as a CD, DVD or other non-transitory medium. In this particular embodiment, IHS 600 includes a processor 610 having multiple cores on a common semiconductor die 612 . IHS 600 processes, transfers, communicates, modifies, stores or otherwise handles information in digital form, analog form or other form. IHS 600 includes a bus 615 that couples processor 610 to system memory 620 via a memory controller 625 and memory bus 630 . A video graphics controller 635 couples display 640 to bus 615 . Nonvolatile storage 645 , such as a hard disk drive, CD drive, DVD drive, or other nonvolatile storage couples to bus 615 to provide IHS 600 with permanent storage of information. Operating system 606 loads in memory 620 to govern the operation of IHS 600 . I/O devices 650 , such as a keyboard and a mouse pointing device, couple to bus 615 via I/O controller 655 and I/O bus 660 . One or more expansion busses 665 , such as USB, IEEE 1394 bus, ATA, SATA, PCI, PCIE and other busses, couple to bus 615 to facilitate the connection of peripherals and devices to IHS 600 . A network interface adapter 670 couples to bus 615 to enable IHS 600 to connect by wire or wirelessly to a network and other information handling systems. While FIG. 6A shows one IHS that employs processor 610 , the IHS may take many forms. For example, IHS 600 may take the form of a desktop, server, portable, laptop, notebook, or other form factor computer or data processing system. IHS 600 may take other form factors such as a gaming device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld computing device, a portable telephone device, a communication device or other devices that include a processor and memory. A user of IHS 600 loads medium 608 into IHS 600 to store coffee design application 602 on non-volatile storage 645 as coffee design application 602 ′. When IHS 600 initializes, the IHS loads operating system 606 into system memory 620 for execution as operating system 606 ′. The IHS also loads coffee design application 602 ′ into system memory 620 for execution as coffee design application 602 ″. FIG. 6B shows a hand-held information handling system 675 that exhibits a small form factor such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). For example, IHS 675 may be a portable telephone type device or hand-held computer, such as an IHS that executes Microsoft Windows CE, or a Palm Pilot type device or an iPhone type IHS or smart phone. (PalmPilot is a trademark of Palm, Inc. iPhone is a trademark of Apple Inc.) In this embodiment, coffee design application 602 is embedded within the small form factor IHS as shown in FIG. 6B. In more detail, hand-held IHS 675 includes a microcontroller 676 that includes an internal memory 677 and firmware 678 . IHS 675 includes a non-volatile memory 679 coupled to microcontroller 676 . In one embodiment, non-volatile memory 679 stores coffee design application 602 therein as shown. In another embodiment, firmware 678 may contain coffee design application 602 or memory 677 may contain coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 includes a sensor package 680 that includes an accelerometer sensor 681 , a proximity sensor 682 , a touch sensor 683 and a photo sensor 684 . Sensor package 680 couples to microcontroller 676 . IHS 675 further includes an RF communication package 685 that includes a 3G/GPRS/GSM phone communication module 686 , and EDGE phone communication module 687 , an IEEE 802.11 network communication module 688 and a Bluetooth local communication module 689 . RF communication package 686 couples to microcontroller 676 . Both a touch sensitive display 690 and a camera 691 couple to microcontroller 676 as shown. A global positioning system (GPS) module 692 also couples to microcontroller 676 to provide position information thereto. In one embodiment, sensor package 680 generates a first position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a first spatial position or orientation such as a horizontal position, for example, with respect to a particular reference point. Sensor package 680 generates a second position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a second spatial position or orientation such as a vertical position with respect to the particular reference point. IHS 675 is configured to send the first and second position signals to coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 is further configured such that coffee design application receives user input from touch screen display 690 when sensor package 680 generates the first position signal indicating that the IHS 675 is in the first position. Coffee design application 602 responds to the first position signal and accepts user input when it receives the first position signal. For example, such user input may include user input preferences to set modes and temperatures, and user input commands to accept % TDS strength and other input variables using a combination of touch screen commands, buttons and text or number entry modes. When coffee design application 602 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second position, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response computes and plots the solution and charts results of the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula curve, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . In other words, the user holds IHS 676 horizontally while inputting information and flips the IHS 675 to a vertical position to command that IHS 675 draw a universal brewing control chart on the display 690 . It is noted that the first and second positions are described as being horizontal and vertical, respectively, for purposes of example. The disclosed IHS applies as well to other first and second positions or spatial orientations without departing from the spirit of the invention. FIG. 7 depicts a textual representation of the disclosed coffee design process  including 1) setting user preferences at set preferences block 705 , 2) conducting the design protocol at design protocol block 710 , 3) performing a total dissolved solids (TDS) measurement with a refractometer at TDS measurement block 715 , 4) correcting the brew protocol if necessary (included in block 715 ), 5) saving data at block 720 , and 6) printing data at block 725 . The process also includes providing help information at block 730 . The processor further includes an “about the program” block 730 with design credits, legal notices and license key information. FIGS. 7A-7B show provides a high level overview of the coffee design process. The screen shots of FIG. 8A-8J will provide more detail with respect to the coffee design process and are discussed below following discussion of the FIG. 7A-7B high level process. The user sets preferences in set preferences block 705 . More particularly, the user may select one of three different coffee design modes as a starting preference, namely: Start By Entering 1) brewing water volume 2) desired coffee yield or 3) ground coffee weight. In brewing water volume design mode, the user inputs starting brewing water volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS as input values. In response, coffee design application 602 determines or computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely ground coffee weight and resulting coffee yield volume. In desired coffee yield mode, the user inputs the desired coffee yield in volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight. In ground coffee weight mode, the user inputs the ground coffee weight and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume. In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may select the starting water temperature. In one embodiment, the default starting water temperature is 55 degrees F. However, a user may select a starting water temperature between 55 and 70 degrees F. if the user is using a home brewer with bottled or tap water. The user may also select a brewing temperature in block 705 . The default brewing temperature is 201 degrees F. in one embodiment. The user may select a brewing temperature that is typically between 190 and 205 degrees F. The user may also specify temperature units in degrees F. or degrees C. in block 705 . In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may also select target settings for the coffee brewing process. For example, the user may input a coffee target extraction (solubles yield). The default coffee target coffee extraction is 20%, but for some coffees, a user may want to target a lower value, such as 19.5%, to emphasize sweetness, or sugars content, typical of high elevation grown coffees, for example. For other coffees that lack certain types of acidic components, one may want to select a higher target extraction, such as 22%, for example, since higher solubles yield (extraction) of that particular coffee will not extract bitter components. The user may also specify an iced coffee target extraction for which the default is 19%, to emphasize sweetness. The user may also specify a finished iced coffee target TDS strength for which the default is 2% after dilution and brewing over ice. The user may also specify and input brew chart preferences such as enabling pan and zoom on the universal brewing chart (discussed below), turning on and off taste defect labels and turning on and off region labels, as well as specifying custom regions of interest by particular coffees and or consumer preference regions. In a special case, ICED Coffee final strength target is set by the user as a preference to provide the coffee design application an input for calculation of 97% ice melt (and dilution) of concentrate which starts at a concentration strength TDS of 3.8%, and ending up at 2.0% after dilution (ICE melt). In the design protocol block 710 of the process flow of FIGS. 7A-7B, the user may select or input desired starting value units. For example, for coffee yield the user may specify volume units such as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In another embodiment, coffee yield units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In an other embodiment, brew water units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may then enter input value in the units selected in the previous step, as well as the desired strength in percent TDS. For example, in the case of coffee yield in volume, the user may specify the desired coffee yield as 2 liters, or 1.5 gallons. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In each mode, the % TDS is also selected as in an input value. For coffee brewing protocols, brew water and coffee yield are typically measured in volume for practical reasons, due to the ease of measurement of such bulk in volume versus weight, as long as temperature (and density) are taken into account. However, in espresso, or single-serve coffee, where volumes are typically much smaller, for example, for a single-serve portion, measurements are more practical and also more accurate when specified in weight. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may also input a selection that the start temperature is the brew temperature if desired. More particularly, the user may select a “start temperature =brew temperature” checkbox (discussed below in FIG. 8) by checking such box if using a commercial brewer with a boiler tank or may leave the checkbox unchecked if using a home brewer with tap or bottled at 50-75 degrees F. The user may also select the desired strength preference within design protocol block 710 . The user may adjust and select the desired strength preference by moving an adjustable strength slider (discussed below in FIG. 8). The adjustable strength slider selects desired strength in total dissolved solids (TDS) percent. The TDS range accessible by the strength slider is based on beverage type. For hot coffee, the selectable range varies from 1.0-2.0% in one embodiment. The user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 2.00% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range'” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Alternatively, the user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 3.60% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range 2 ” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Extended ranges are useful for troubleshooting existing coffee brewing protocols in the field that are being evaluated to be corrected, and may not be within normal ranges, due to significant brew formula portioning errors in excess of 5-8%, for example, or excessive extraction errors, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 4%, to cover a range more appropriate for coffee concentrates, such as for iced coffee, or for hot coffee to be diluted to a desired strength preference by addition of hot water to the brewed concentrate, for a single serve beverage brewer, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 18%, to cover a range more appropriate for espresso, for example. Upon selection of the desired strength preference and the other input values and selection of units, coffee design application 602 generates a brew formula curve or line which is plotted on a universal coffee brewing chart such as shown in FIG. 5. Recall that the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction. The Brew Formula Ratio is used to calculate point pairs using Equation 1. The plotted brew formula line takes into account the volume of water as a function of temperature, and computes the correct weight of coffee required to meet the specified brewing protocol, and the resulting finished coffee yield. The target strength selected is plotted on the brew formula line as a small circle 515 (red point) and represents the targeted design parameters. The user then proceeds to brew the coffee using the design output parameters that coffee design application 602 generates. If the user selected brew water volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the resulting coffee yield volume and required ground coffee weight values corresponding to those input conditions. If the user selected desired coffee yield volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight values corresponding to that input condition. If the user selected coffee weight and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume corresponding to those input conditions. The user then employs the particular input conditions and corresponding values to actually brew a test batch of coffee. As part of the coffee design process of FIGS. 7A-7B, the user brews a sample of the targeted design batch of coffee as specified by the input conditions and corresponding determined variable values or results. The user places a sample of the test batch into the disclosed coffee refractometer (see FIG. 10 below) to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % by measuring the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Before using the refractometer, the user first calibrates the refractometer using distilled water. The refractometer and water should preferably be within the temperature range of 20 degrees-25 degrees C., in one embodiment. The user cools a 10-20 ml sample of the brewed coffee to between 20 degrees C. and 30 degrees C. The user places the cooled sample into the refractometer and allows 1-2 minutes for the sample and the refractometer to reach the same temperature. After temperature stabilization, the user takes a TDS % reading, as per bock 715 . The user then enters the TDS reading into coffee design application 602 . In response, coffee design application 602 adds a large circle plot point 520 (blue point) on the same brew formula line 510 of the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 generated during the design step. The large circle (blue point) % TDS measurement shows where the current coffee batch falls on that chart relative to the intended design point 515 (small red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield). After observing where the current coffee batch results appear on the universal coffee brewing chart, the user may take corrective action, if necessary, to ensure that the final coffee design for subsequent batches of coffee falls within the parameters of the desired region of interest. Such corrective action may include: 1) Under-Extraction: If the blue large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, below and to the left on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was under-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with under-developed flavors. Common causes of under-extraction are too coarse a grind, too short a contact time with water during the brew period, lack of pre-infusion or pre-infusion levels too low and/or time too short, water too hard (mineral content too high), brew temperature too low, and/or lack of even wetting or turbulence in the brew basket. 2) Over-Extraction: If the large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, above and to the right on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was over-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with over-extracted bitter flavors. Common causes of over-extraction are too fine a grind, too long a contact time with water during the brew period, pre-infusion levels too high and/or time too long, too much turbulence in the brew basket, water too soft (too low a mineral content), and/or brew temperature too high. FIGS. 8C, 8 E and 8 G depict screen shots of coffee design application 602 that show different startup modes that are selectable via user Startup Preferences (FIG. 8A), with input selections and corresponding outputs and universal brew formula plotted on charts 8 B, 8 D and 8 F. More particularly, the following design modes are selectable via user startup preferences: 1) brew water volume 2) desired coffee yield and 3) ground coffee weight. The user selects one of the 3 modes as starting input variables in coffee design application 602 . In response to this selection and percent TDS as inputs, coffee design application 602 determines the remaining 2 variables as outputs. For example, if the user selects brewing water volume (and selects a % TDS) as the starting variable or mode, coffee design application 602 determines a corresponding coffee yield and coffee ground weight. Alternatively, if the user selects desired coffee yield (and selects a % TDS), then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and coffee ground weight needed to achieve this desired coffee yield. This mode is a particularly useful and valuable tool for the coffee trade because it promotes better brewing practice. For example, typically, a brewer may be programmed to dispense water volume in units of gallons, for example one-half gallon. However, the user may be brewing into a commonly available 2.2 or 2.5 liter brewing thermos. Typical yield under these conditions will be approximately 1.7 liters, leaving 0.5 to 0.7 liters in the thermos empty. Coffee brewed in this manner will degrade more rapidly because it cools more quickly, and loses aromatic volatiles that evaporate and condense inside the empty portion of the thermos. Selecting this mode will automatically adjust the required brew water volume and ground coffee required to yield a full batch sized to the thermos is use. Using coffee design application 602 , any units of brew water volume, desired coffee yield and ground coffee weight may be selected to suit the actual conditions in the field. Alternatively, if the user selects coffee ground weight (at the desired % TDS strength) as a starting variable or mode, then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and resulting coffee yield. This mode is particularly useful for users of pre-ground coffee packets (pillow-packs), where the user selects a fixed coffee portion and desired percent TDS (strength) and application 602 outputs the required brew water volume and resulting yield to brew to gold-cup standards. Coffee design application 602 generates three windows that help to design and measure brewing parameters. These windows are 1) a startup preferences or brewing preferences window, 2) a main application window and a 3) universal brewing control chart. Coffee design application 602 charts parameters and provides instant feedback so that adjustments, when necessary, can be made quickly and effectively by the user. FIG. 8A shows a Startup Preferences window 801 that coffee design application 602 generates to enable the user to input operating modes and preferences. Preferences (including changes) are saved automatically between application sessions. The user starts a first design session using the Default Preferences. Upon entering startup preferences window 801 , the user selects a preferred design mode in the “Start by Entering” area 802 in the upper left corner of window 801 . The user selects one of the three buttons in the “Start by Entering” area 802 , namely 1) the Water Volume button 803 —Select this option to design by entering the Brew Water Volume amount. In this mode, the software determines or calculates the ground coffee and coffee yield amounts based on user strength TDS selected, 2)the Desired Coffee Yield (Vol) button 804 —Select this option to design by entering the Desired Coffee Yield Volume; in this mode, the coffee design application software 202 determines or calculates the ground coffee and brew water amounts based on user strength TDS selected, or 3) the Ground Coffee Weight button 805 —Select this option if you are working with a fixed weight of coffee, such as a pillow pack. In this mode, the coffee design application software 202 calculates the brew water volume and coffee yield volume amounts based on user strength TDS selected. The user may select the “Start Value=Last Used” checkbox 806 if the user desires the coffee design application 602 to remember the mode and values used in the last session upon the next startup of the application. Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Target Settings” area 807 where the user may input Hot Coffee Target Extraction % at box 808 . For standard drip brewing of coffee, this default is set to 20 percent extraction, an industry standard “starting point” applicable to a wide range of coffees. For a sweeter cup, the user may try 18.5-19.5 percent, depending on taste preferences, the particular coffee, degree of roast, and grade of grind. Note that extracting to lower targeted levels will require more coffee to achieve the same strength preference. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Extraction at box 809 . For iced coffee, the default target extraction of 19% results in a sweeter cup that is significantly less bitter than a setting of 20% would provide. With higher elevation grown coffees rich in sugars, this recipe often results in a sweet tasting batch without the use of supplemental sweeteners. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Strength at box 810 . For iced coffee, this is the final result of the concentrate after 95-97% all of the ice has melted at the end of the brew. The concentrate is ready to use immediately after the brew cycle has completed. Box 811 indicates the current strength (% TDS) range selected for the available design and chart range. If the user selects normal range checkbox 811 A, then box 811 displays a strength range of 1.15-1.55%. If the user selects “Extended Range 1 ” checkbox 811 B, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-2.00%. If the user selects “Extended Range 2 ” checkbox 811 C, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-3.6%. These ranges extend the user selectable TDS strength range and also resize the Y-axis on the universal brewing control chart accordingly, and is useful for troubleshooting existing brewing protocols in the field that are out-of-range and off the universal brew chart region of interest Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Water Temperatures” area 812 where the user may input the starting temperature of the water in the brewer at “Start” box 813 and the actual brew temperature of the water in the brewer at “Brew” box 814 . The user may select either a degrees F. or a degrees C. scale at temperature scale selection box 812 A. For example, the user should select the Brew Temp at Brew box 814 to the programmed setting of the user's brewer (usually 195-202 Deg F.) for light to medium roasted coffees, slightly lower, i.e., 195 Deg F. for dark roasted coffees. The user may enter the start temperature at Start Temperature box 813 to what may typically be in use at home, which should be equal to either TAP water temperature or room temperature (i.e., for bottled water). Using the start and brew temperatures specified, application 602 determines the actual brew water volume and ground coffee weight required to maintain the correct brew formula ratio, a common cause of error when trying to transfer brew formulas from a commercial to a home brewer for example. Preferences window 801 further includes a “Chart Settings” area 815 for setting preferences in the universal brewing control chart that coffee design application 602 generates. In one embodiment coffee design application 602 may allow the displaying of stored or custom regions of interest for optimum balance to be overlaid onto the universal brewing control chart. Coffee taste preference “regions” have been previously defined by different organizations (i.e. Midwest Research Institute (MRI), Coffee Brewing Center (CBC), Norwegian Coffee Center (NCC) as the “Optimum Balance” regions, or, as shown, other custom regions may be added to the chart based on individual preferences found to be appropriate for particular coffees, roast styles, and or customer surveys. Such custom regions need not be rectangular, as shown, but may be any shape including three dimensional, exhibiting preferences in percentile categories. Selecting the “Show Region Labels” checkbox 816 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a label identifying the region of interest. Selecting the “Show Taste Labels” checkbox 817 instructs the coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart that displays taste defect labels (i.e., bitter or under-developed). Selecting the “Enable Zoom/Pan” checkbox 818 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart on which the user may use mouse and/or trackpad controls to zoom/pan the Universal Brewing Control Chart along with its axis. The final universal brewing control chart as configured, plotted and labeled may be saved in any commonly available formats (such as jpeg, png, bmp, emf, gif, tif), emailed, entered into a database, electronically shared, and or printed on demand. Upon completion of entering input preferences and settings in startup preferences window 801 , the user may select Done box 819 . After the Startup Preferences have been selected as described above, the user completes the brewing protocol design process in the coffee design application 602 in the Main Application Window shown in FIG. 8C. More details on using the Main Application Window discussed below with reference to FIG. 8C. However, before discussion Main Application Window in detail, it is helpful to first discuss the Universal Brewing Control Chart of FIG. 8B that coffee design application 602 produces. Coffee design application 602 performs all calculations and plots a brewing control chart dynamically and in real time as you change the % TDS strength preference slider control. Coffee design application 602 converts between different types of units instantly and accurately, and allows for mixed units (i.e., brew water in gallons, coffee yield in liters). Coffee design application 602 draws a custom brew formula line on a universal brewing control chart using any combination of selected units in weight and or volume, without restrictions to fixed portions. Application 602 also provides a relative indication of designed recipe to the measured results, in reference to a number of internationally recognized “optimum” brewing ranges. Application 602 further provides a means to troubleshoot current brewing protocols, measure and plot results which immediately identify portioning and extraction errors, and provides a means to correct them. The appearance of the Main Design Window of FIG. 8C depends on the variable the user selected to enter as the INPUT data in the Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A. Coffee design application 602 displays the computed OUTPUT data immediately below in the next group box of the window, and plots the results on the Universal Brewing Control Chart dynamically and in real time in a charting window seen in FIG. 8B. The completed data and universal brewing control chart as configured, labeled and plotted on the Main Application Window may be saved, recalled, electronically shared, printed or emailed. Each “recipe” may be stored separately, or in one embodiment of the application 602 , as part of a database residing within the application or as part of a shared networked database application. FIG. 8B shows a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 that includes a representative coffee brew formula line 821 . The Universal Brewing Control Chart plots the actual design point 822 (small circle) and measured results 823 (large circle) from input data and % TDS measurements from the disclosed coffee refractometer. FIG. 8B shows a typical universal coffee brewing control chart 820 , taken from the brew formula discussed below. FIG. 8B shows the desired brew formula line as brew formula line 821 . The brew formula line 821 represents the ratio (17.08:1) of water to coffee by weight used to brew the coffee. The resulting TDS of the brewed coffee will be determined by the brew formula, as well as other factors (temperature, grade of grind, dwell time, and turbulence). The final % TDS measurement 823 may then be followed down to the X-axis, to see how close the results (19.8%) came to the design target extraction (20.0%). The small circle 822 on the Brew Formula line shows the selected strength design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 on the brew formula line 821 shows the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring and inputting the TDS % of the brewed coffee into coffee application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. The actual resulting extraction and strength are plotted as a result of the TDS % measurement on a specialized coffee refractometer disclosed and discussed below in more detail. Universal brewing control chart 820 includes a number of coffee design target regions of interest. Chart 820 shows the George Howell Coffee Company (GHCC) suggested target region of interest as region of interest 824 for optimum balance. Chart 820 also shows a Midwest Research Institute region of interest 825 . Chart 820 further shows a target region of interest 826 defined by the Norwegian Coffee Center. FIG. 8C shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew from the starting water volume is now discussed, namely the water volume mode. The Startup Preferences discussed earlier set up the main window for this water volume mode, including brew water temperature to match the brewer boiler setting in use. The brew water volume is first calibrated, according to the brewer manufacturer specifications, to dose correctly the amount of water programmed as the starting brew water volume. The user then performs the following coffee design steps: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left-hand corner of main application window 827 . 2. Enter the preferred Brew Water units in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Water Volume field 830 , and enter the Water Volume in the Water Volume field 830 . For example, the user may enter a brew water volume value of 0.50 gal. in Water Volume field 830 . 3. Select the preferred Strength TDS % with the slider 831 on the window's left side. In response to the above described user design inputs, application software 602 determines the brew formula and the corresponding required Ground Coffee weight and final Coffee Yield. Coffee design application 602 then displays the determined Ground Coffee weight at Ground Coffee weight box 833 and displays the final Coffee Yield at Coffee Yield box 832 . Final values, including the brew formula ratio, are also displayed in the legend of the brewing control chart. The units are selectable by the user at units select boxes 834 and 835 . In this example, the resultant yield is 56.52 fl oz (US) and the ground coffee weight is 3.75 oz (wt.) The coffee design application 602 draws the brew formula curve 821 as seen in the universal coffee brewing control chart of FIG. 8D. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target Strength TDS 822 at the pre-set target extraction of 20%. 4. If not done earlier, the user may enter the preferred units of measure in the two output fields, namely Coffee Yield volume 834 and Ground Coffee weight 835 of FIG. 8C. Alternatively, the user may convert these units to any desired units using boxes 834 and 835 . 5. After brewing in accordance with the above parameters, the user may test the total dissolved solids (TDS) using the disclosed coffee refractometer. The user may enter the measured % TDS in the Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 after selecting TDS % at box 837 as the instrument readout mode. Alternatively, coffee design application 602 will provide a conversion estimate for TDS % using box 837 that may be set to ppm or BRIX if another TDS instrument or refractometer provides readings in those units. 6. The user may use a File>Save menu selection to save the brew formula, chart and portion plan, and may print the same if desired. To summarize, in the above example, beverage type was set to Hot Coffee, brew water volume was set to 0.50 gallons, and the strength slider 831 was set to 1.3% as the desired coffee strength. Coffee design application 602 determines the brew formula ratio, the required ground coffee in oz-wt and the resulting brewed coffee yield in fl-oz volume. Brew temperature was the same as start temperature at 201 Deg F. FIG. 8E shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the second mode, namely, coffee yield as input, is now discussed as coffee yield mode. Traditionally, brew formulas have been developed using a pre-set volume of brew water as part of the brew recipe. For example, a one (1) gallon batch meant setting the brewer for one gallon of brew water, and using approximately 7.5 ounces coffee (i.e., the gold-cup standard for 1.3% TDS). However, this method results in a final yield of approximately 112-fluid ounces, leaving about 16-fl oz empty in the brewing vessel. In the Desired Yield mode, the disclosed coffee design application 602 enables the user to specify one (1) gallon of finished coffee to fill the brewing vessel completely. In one embodiment, coffee design application 602 determines exact portions of brew water and ground coffee required, for example 1.13 gallons of brew water and 8.5 ounces of coffee. This design mode allows the user to specify the finished yield needed to fill a brewing thermos, rather than leave a significant percentage empty. Units can be mixed in any combination (brew water in gallons, yield in liters), and coffee design application 602 determines the required results in the units specified. For example, for a 2.5 liter thermos, 0.75 gallons brew water and 5.6 ounces of coffee will yield exactly 2.5 liters of finished coffee. To ensure accurate portions of water and coffee, coffee design application 602 takes into account the water lost in the spent basket and the volume of water required as a function of temperature. The brew basket refers to a vessel (not shown) that holds coffee grounds in the correct depth and area in the brewer for proper wetting and extraction during the coffee brewing process. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Desired Coffee Yield button 804 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8E and enters the desired coffee yield into Desired Coffee Yield box 830 as shown in FIG. 8E. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Set the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 [in the lower left corner of main application window 827 ] to select the Hot Coffee charting range. 2. Select the preferred units of measure of the Desired Yield in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Desired Yield field box 830 , and enter the Desired Yield for the finished coffee in Desired Yield field box 830 . For example, the user may select liters in box 829 and 2.35 in box 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields at Brew Water Volume unit selection box 834 and Ground Coffee Weight unit selection box 835 . In this particular example, coffee design application 602 determines the required Brew Water Volume in liters and the Ground Coffee weight required in grams. When using a commercial brewer, the user should check Start=Brew Temperature box 838 to indicate that the starting temperature is equal to the brewing temperature. 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.27 TDS % in this example. 5. After brewing a batch of coffee under the input conditions above, the user may measure the total dissolved solids in the batch of coffee from a sample thereof. The user places a sample of the brewed batch in the disclosed coffee refractometer discussed in more detail below. The coffee refractometer measures Total Dissolved Solids in percent (%). The user takes a TDS reading from the coffee refractometer and enters the measured % TDS in the “Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement” field or box 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode facilitates better coffee brewing practice in a number of ways. For example, in this design mode, application 602 determines or calculates the coffee and water portions required to nearly fill the brewing vessel completely. This mode also reduces the amount of air in a thermos or other coffee brew receptacle, and reduces the loss of aroma producing volatiles, while increasing the volume of hot coffee brewed. The additional thermal mass of coffee keeps the thermos hot longer, and can increase hold times by up to 10-15 minutes per batch. This mode may also reduce the frequency of brewing, making a coffee brewing operation more efficient. This mode may allow brewing larger batches that inherently reduces portioning errors. In the “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode in the example of FIG. 8E, the Beverage Type is set to Hot Coffee at Beverage Type drop down menu 828 , and Desired Yield is set to 2.35 Liters in boxes 830 , 832 for a 2.5 Liter Thermos receptacle. Strength slider 831 is set to 1.27% TDS. The disclosed coffee refractometer is used to test a sample of the brewed coffee. In this example, the coffee refractometer measures a TDS value of 1.3%, which is entered by the user at Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement input box 836 . In response to entering the TDS value, coffee design application 602 plots a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ as shown in FIG. 8F. Universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ shows the brew formula, namely a brew formula line 821 ′, as a brew formula ratio of 17.56 to 1. Coffee design application 602 plots a small circle 822 ′ that indicates the selected strength coffee design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 ′ on brew formula line 821 ′ indicates the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring the TDS % of the brewed coffee sample with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputting the measured TDS % into coffee design application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. Since the measured coffee results are within 0.5% of the target extraction (solubles yield) of the design target, no further adjustment is required in this example. The final coffee design recipe values are also shown in the chart Legend 840 , at the bottom of the chart 820 ′. FIG. 8G shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the third mode, namely ground coffee weight as input, is now discussed as ground coffee weight mode. Design by ground coffee weight is a commonly used in high volume feeder establishments using pre-measured, pre-ground pillow packs. While it is not preferable to pre-grind coffee for freshness reasons, this mode is provided to address such feeder establishments, so they can improve their coffee brewing practices to internationally accepted standards. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Ground Coffee Weight button 805 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8G and enters the ground coffee weight into ground coffee weight box 830 as shown in FIG. 8G. For example, if the weight of a pre-ground coffee pillow pack is 3.5 oz, then the user selects the unit ounces in unit selection box 829 and inputs 3.5 into box 830 as shown. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left corner of main application window 827 . 2. Select the preferred unit of measure in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Ground Coffee field 830 , and enter the weight in the Ground Coffee field 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields, namely Brew Water Volume and Yield. Coffee design application 602 determines or calculates the required Brew Water Volume and the final coffee Yield volume in the units selected. Start Temperature=Brew Temperature is checked at checkbox 838 . 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . In this example, the user engages slider 831 to select a strength of 1.3%. 5. After brewing coffee in accordance with the determined parameters, the user then employs the disclosed coffee refractometer to measure the total dissolved solids, TDS, of a sample of the brewed coffee. The user enters the measured % TDS in the Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This example illustrates how to design to desired strength protocols using fixed ground coffee packets by weight. Coffee design application 602 calculates the required brew Water Volume and Yield volume of coffee in the units selected. The Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 was set to Hot Coffee. Ground Coffee was set to the packet size of 3.5 ounces weight. Strength slider was set to 1.30% TDS. Dissolved Solids were measured and entered at 1.3% Coffee design application 602 draws a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ″ as shown in FIG. 8H. In FIG. 8H, box 824 ″ represents the desired target region and line 821 ″ represents the particular brew formula ratio, namely 17.19 to 1, in this particular example that employs 0.47 gallons of water and 3.5 oz (wt) of coffee to brew a batch of coffee. Small circle 822 ″ represents the desired design point on brew formula line 821 ″, while large circle 823 ″ represents the actual coffee design point determined in response to the measured TDS % of the brewed coffee batch measure in the disclosed coffee refractometer. Region 824 ″ is the particular region of interest on the brew control chart of FIG. 8H. This design mode is useful for users of pre-ground and pre-weighed fixed packs of ground coffee wishing to improve their coffee brewing protocols by providing a means to reprogram their brewers to brew to gold-cup standards, even though fixed weight packs have been provided. FIG. 8I shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 which is also useful in designing coffee concentrates. This example shows an iced coffee design, where the user selects iced coffee in Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 . The coffee design application 602 will design coffee extraction protocols for Iced Coffee Concentrate, to be brewed fresh and directly over ice. Coffee design application 602 calculates coffee concentrate TDS strength both before and after ice is melted. The process is designed to allow approximately 95% to approximately 97% percent of the ice to melt at brew completion time, so that the finished concentrate is cold, and ready to serve immediately after brewing. In one embodiment, the complete brewing cycle takes only 5-6 minutes, typically. Care should be taken using this mode to choose portions that will not overload nor overflow the brew basket. For example, a 0.5-1.0 gallon brewer may be able to brew 7-9 ounces of ground coffee, but could overflow the brew basket if more ground coffee is used. Generally, a 1.5 gallon brewer can accommodate up to 12-14 ounces ground coffee. Design by coffee weight mode is supported in this embodiment, to ensure such limitations are adhered to, and application 602 determines the required brew water volume, concentrate yield, and weight of ice required. In this example, the user sets the coffee brew strength to 3.8% using slider 831 . The user employs brew water volume as the starting value in Enter Starting Value box 830 . The units are gallons in unit selection box 829 . In this example, it is assumed that a typical 1.5 gallon brewer is being used. The brewer is programmed to dispense 0.7 gallons, yielding approximately a half-gallon (0.49 gal) of coffee at 3.7% TDS. The coffee is brewed into an open top container containing 62 ounces-weight of ice, then stirred and covered. The resulting concentrate is after serving over ice in a glass filled two-thirds will be about 1.5-1.8% TDS. Total concentrate yield is just under one gallon. This serves approximately sixteen 16-oz servings (7.5 fl oz concentrate over approximately 8 oz-wt ice). Coffee design application 602 plots the resultant brew formula ratio curve 821 ′″ as seen in FIG. 8J. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target coffee design point as small circle 822 ′″. After the user measures the total dissolved solids TDS % with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputs the TDS % value, for example 3.7%, in box 836 , application 602 plots the actual coffee design point at large circle 823 ′″ on brew formula ratio line 821 ′″. FIG. 9A is a flowchart that shows process flow in the methodology that the disclosed information handling system 600 employs. In one embodiment, when loaded into system 600 , coffee design application 602 of computer program product 608 enables system 600 to carry out this methodology. System 600 asks the user to select from the following design coffee modes: 1) brew water volume mode 2) desired coffee yield mode and 3) ground coffee weight mode, as per block 900 of the flowchart of FIG. 9A. System 600 asks the user to select a coffee target extraction percent, as per block 902 . System 600 receives the user's coffee target extraction percent selection as input to the coffee design process. System 600 asks the user to set the starting water temperature and the brewing water temperature, as per block 904 . System 600 receives the user's starting water temperature and brewing water temperature as inputs to the coffee design process. System 600 queries the user to determine if the starting temperature equals the brewing temperature, as per block 906 . System 600 queries the user to select a beverage type, namely hot coffee, iced coffee or in another embodiment, espresso, as per block 908 . The Beverage Type drop-down menu pre-sets 828 are used to adjust the brewing and chart areas of solubles concentration (% TDS Strength) and solubles yield (% Extraction) to the appropriate ranges commonly used for brewing the selected types of beverage(s). System 600 receives the user's Beverage Type selection as input to the coffee design process. System 600 presents a slider tool 831 to the user to enable the user to select a design coffee strength, as per block 910 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.3% with the slider tool, or may also use arrow keys, touch screen controls or other methods for setting the input value. System 600 receives the user's selection of coffee strength as input to the coffee design process. System 600 determines the brew formula ratio using 1) weight of water, determined from the volume of the water at the prescribed brewing temperature 2) the target extraction percent (% solubles yield) and 3) the design TDS target strength (% solubles concentration) from the slider control (i.e. coffee strength), as per block 912 . The final brew formula ratio is equal to the weight of water divided by the weight of coffee as determined by the above parameters, and remains the same regardless of the brew batch size. System 600 generates a universal control chart graph including a grid showing TDS range (%) on the y axis vs. coffee extraction (%) on the x axis, as per block 914 . Using the brew formula ratio determined in block 912 , system 600 plots and displays on the universal control chart graph the brew formula line that represents the brew formula ratio. System 600 performs tests to determine if the user selected 1) brew water volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, or 3) ground coffee weight mode at decision blocks 918 , 920 and 922 . If the user selected 1) brew water volume mode, then process flow continues to the brew water volume module of FIG. 9B, as per block 924 . If the user selected 2) desired coffee yield mode, then process flow continues to the desired coffee yield mode of FIG. 9C, as per block 926 . If the user selected 3) ground coffee weight mode, then process flow continues to ground coffee weight module of FIG. 9D, as per block 928 . FIG. 9B shows process steps that system 600 performs when the user selects the brew water volume mode. In one embodiment, coffee design application 602 instructs system 600 to carry out these process steps. System 600 asks the user to select brew water volume units, as per block 930 . In one embodiment, this is achieved by a pull-down menu or unit selection box with different volume unit selections. System 600 receives the user's brew water volume unit selection as input to the coffee design process. System 600 also asks the user to select the brew water volume, as per block 932 . System 600 receives the selected brew water volume as input to the coffee design process. System 600 asks or allows the user to select units for the coffee yield variable that the system determines in response to user input, as per block 934 . The selected units may be milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons, for example. Coffee yield is a determined or calculated variable that is a function of user input selections. System 600 asks or allows the user to select units for the ground coffee weight variable that the system determines in response to user input, as per block 936 . The selected units may be grams, ounces or pounds, for example. Ground coffee weight is a determined or calculated variable that is a function of user input selections. System 600 converts the selected volume and weight units to predetermined internal standard units (e.g. metric units) before performing variable determinations in response to user input, as per block 938 . Calculations are performed within system 600 in these standard units and then converted later to the units selected by the user for display purposes. System 600 determines the ground coffee weight variable using 1) brew water weight 2) water density at brew temperature 3) target extraction percent and 4) design TDS from the strength input slider, as per block 940 . More particularly, coffee design application 602 of system 600 employs EQUATION 2 to determine the coffee weight variable: coffee weight(g)=water weight(g)/( E %*(1/TDS %−0.01)+waterdensity@brew temp(g/ml)*waterLost(ml/g)   EQUATION 2 wherein E % is Extraction percent. System 600 converts the determined ground coffee weight variable to the user-selected units and displays the result, as per block 942 . System 600 determines the brew water volume lost at brew temperature using the coffee weight, as per block 944 . System 600 determines the coffee yield volume variable using 1) the brew volume at the start temperature, 2) water density at the start temperature, 3) water density at the brew temperature, and 4) brew volume lost at brew temperature, as per block 946 . More particularly, coffee design application 602 of system 600 employs EQUATIONS 3 to determine the coffee yield volume variable: 1) Volume Lost_at — T brew(ml)=waterLost(ml/g)*coffee weight(g) 2) Yield volume(ml)_at — T brew=water_volume(ml)_at — T start*Density(g/ml)@startTemp/Density(g/ml)@brewTemp−volume Lost_at — T brew(ml);   EQUATION 3 System 600 converts the determined coffee yield volume to the user-selected units and displays the results, as per block 948 .

The user or other entity then brews coffee using the specified parameters and determined variables or results, as per block 990 . The user, other entity or apparatus measures the actual total dissolved solids that the resultant brewed coffee exhibits, as per block 991 . For example, the disclosed coffee refractometer may determine the TDS % that a sample of the brewed coffee exhibits. System 600 displays the actual TDS reading on the universal brewing control chart graph, as per block 992 . For example, large circle 823 ″ of the universal brewing control chart graph of FIG. 8H shows such a display of actual TDS results. Process flow continues back to the select design mode block 900 of FIG. 9A, as per block 993 . The user may then again select any coffee design mode desired. Returning again to the small form factor or hand-held information handling system (IHS) 675 of FIG. 6B, it is noted that IHS 675 receives user input in one spatial orientation or position and outputs results to its display 690 when the user moves or changes the IHS to a second spatial orientation or position. More specifically, the user may use touch screen display 690 to make user selections and provide other input while IHS 675 is in the first position. For example, the user employs touch screen display 690 to select startup preferences such as selecting one of multiple design modes, namely 1) brewing water volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, and 3) ground coffee weight mode. The user may also make other input selections shown in startup preferences of FIG. 8A while IHS 675 is oriented in the first spatial orientation. In response to such input and when the user changes the spatial orientation of the IHS to a second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 draws a universal brewing control chart such as shown in FIGS. 8B, 8 D, 8 F, 8 H and 8 J on display 690 . The displayed universal control chart displays the results of user input which may include a TDS % reading from the disclosed refractometer for a brewed coffee sample that is brewed in accordance with the coffee design parameters that coffee design application 602 determines. In one embodiment, to complete the final plot point on the universal brewing control chart, the actual measured % TDS may be entered when IHS 675 is in either the first or second spatial position. For example, the measured % TDS from the disclosed coffee refractometer may be entered on touch screen display 690 on either the universal brewing control chart on the display while the IHS exhibits the second orientation (such as vertical) or the Main Application window while the IHS exhibits the first orientation (such as horizontal) by using extended touch screen commands that appear on the universal brewing control chart, for example, as buttons or data entry boxes, in a visible layer behind the partially transparent displayed chart. Generally, IHS 675 receives the user's input selections while IHS 675 exhibits the first spatial orientation while coffee design application 602 receives the first position signal from sensor package 680 . When coffee design application 602 of IHS 675 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response determines or calculates the solution to the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . Specific recipes for any number of brew formula sessions may be stored in the IHS 675 as an integrated database in non-volatile memory 679 , and or transmitted to a database via any of a number of wireless protocols, including web-based sharing protocols, or electronically mailed to other users to share, and interactively modify, for example, based on a collaborative approach to establishing a desired brewing protocol. Such recipes may be used to control brewing protocols for an entire installed base of brewing equipment, such equipment being programmable manually or automatically to execute said protocol(s), through a manual, wired or wireless interface, for example, for feeder establishments wishing to maintain a high quality coffee brewing program to ensure consistency from cup-to-cup across its entire installed base of restaurants, cafes or coffee bars. FIG. 10A shows the disclosed refractometer 1000 that is usable to measure TDS % of a brewed coffee sample by determining the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Refractometer 1000 includes a light source 1005 such as a yellow semiconductor laser that generates 589 nm light in one embodiment. An illumination lens 1010 directs the light from light source 1005 toward prism 1015 as shown. Prism 1015 receives incident light 1017 from light source 1005 as shown. Prism 1015 is a transparent material that exhibits an index of refraction “n p ”. The user or other entity or apparatus places a coffee brew sample 1020 on prism surface 1025 in preparation for measurement of the index of refraction “n s ” that the brew sample 1020 exhibits. A collection lens 1030 collects light 1032 refracted or reflected by the prism sample interface 1034 and directs that light to a linear photo detector 1035 . The purpose of the illumination lens 1010 is to direct light from light source 1005 to prism 1015 . More specifically, the purpose of illumination lens 1010 is to form a focusing beam or cone of light incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 that ranges in angles of incidence between a minimum angle of incidence, θ min , and a maximum angle of incidence, θ max . The angle of incidence is measured relative to the normal surface 1027 which is perpendicular to the prism surface 1025 . In one embodiment, the critical angle q c of the prism-sample interface 1034 should be such that θ min <θ c <θ max . A unique property of the critical angle is that for all angles larger than than θ c , 100% of the light is reflected from the interface 1034 and none transmits. For angles inside of the prism 1015 that are less than θ c , some light transmits into the sample material 1020 and therefore less than 100% of the light is reflected. In other words, for all rays in the beam of light generated by illumination lens 1010 that are focused in the prism to an incident angle greater than the critical angle θ c , 100% of the light is reflected off of the prism-material interface 1034 and propagates towards the collection lens 1030 and then on to the linear detector 1035 or photodetector. The light ray that is incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 at θ c will strike the linear detector 1035 at a point x=x c . By analyzing the detected light levels from x=0 to x=x max on the detector 1035 , the firmware 1047 or software of the refractometer detects the position x c since for x c <x<x max , the light level is substantially constant across the detector array 1035 . With a well-calibrated refractometer, the detector position x c is mapped back to a critical angle θ c , which from EQUATION 8 below and knowing the index of refraction of the prism n p , the index of refraction n s of the sample can be determined and displayed or otherwise reported. θ c =arcsin( n s /n p )   EQUATION 8 Therefore, in refractometer 1000 the index of refraction of the prism 1015 must satisfy n p >n s for all values of n s desired to be measured in order for a critical angle θ c to exist. Given the range of θ c resulting from the range of n s to be measured, the illumination lens 1010 arrangement is designed to include this range of angles relative to the surface normal 1027 of surface 1025 . Similarly, the collection lens 1030 is designed such that the range of angles θ c are linearly mapped to positions x on the linear detector array 1035 . By way of example, for a refractometer designed to operate with a sugar solution between 0 and 10° BRIX at 20° C., one requires the ability to detect indices of refraction ranging from 1.3330 to 1.3479. Using a source with a wavelength of λ 0 =589 nm and a prism made of BK7 (n p =1.5167@λ 0 ), the range of critical angles to detect are θ c =61.50° to 62.71°. Choosing an Eastman Kodak (Rochester, N.Y.) linear CCD array model KLI-2113 with an array of 2098 pixels for linear detector 1035 , the theoretical resolution is 7E-6 in index of refraction and 0.005° BRIX. In addition to being wavelength sensitive, the index of refraction for any material changes slightly with temperature. For water at 20° C. (68° F.) the index of refraction is 1.333 and changes by −0.0001 for every degree C. The disclosed coffee refractometer includes automatic temperature compensation as described in more detail below. Refractometer 1000 includes a microcontroller 1045 with control firmware 1047 or control software therein. Microcontroller 1045 includes a memory store 1049 for storage of information and data. Refractometer 1000 also includes a temperature sensor 1050 near the prism-sample interface 1034 of prism 1015 . Temperature sensor 1050 couples to an input of microcontroller 1045 to inform microcontroller 1045 of the current temperature of the prism-sample interface 1034 . A control line 1055 couples microcontroller 1045 to light source 1005 to enable microcontroller 1045 to control light source 1005 . Refractometer 1000 also includes a display 1060 to allow refractometer 1000 to display measurement results such as a TDS % value of the brew sample 1020 . Refractometer 1000 further includes a network interface 1065 that enables refractometer 1000 to connect via wire or wirelessly to other information handling systems 600 or the Internet 1070 . Information handling system 600 may include coffee design application 602 which uses the TDS % coffee brew sample result from the refractometer 1000 as input for coffee design universal control chart display purposes. FIG. 10B is a block diagram of a brewing station 1075 that employs the disclosed coffee design system 600 and the disclosed coffee refractometer 1000 . In one embodiment, coffee brewing station 1075 includes a hot water supply 1076 and a brew basket assembly 1077 where coffee grounds mix with hot water to form a coffee drink. As the coffee drink exits brew basket 1077 , the coffee drink flows downward into a vessel 1078 that captures the brewed coffee. Vessel 1078 dispenses brewed coffee to coffee pot 1079 or other container suitable for transporting of the brewed coffee to the coffee drinker. In one embodiment, a coffee refractometer 1000 is situated in vessel 1077 so that refractometer 1000 may determine the TDS reading of a freshly brewed batch of coffee immediately after brewing. A user may take a reading of the TDS % of the coffee from the display of refractometer 1000 . The user may then manually input the TDS % reading into coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 . In response, coffee design application 602 displays the actual TDS % and extraction on the plotted brew line of a universal brew line chart such as seen in FIG. 5. In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 10B, refractometer 1000 couples to, or otherwise communicates with IHS 600 . In this manner, refractometer 1000 reads and supplies TDS % data to coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 without manual user intervention. FIG. 11A is a flowchart that depicts process steps for configuring refractometer 1000 to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % of a brew coffee sample. To use refractometer 1000 to measure the total dissolved solids (TDS) of coffee or any other liquid, refractometer 1000 should be both calibrated and correlated. The calibration of a refractometer is performed by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. The correlation of a refractometer is the conversion of the measured index of refraction to a scale of interest to the end user. Typically, refractometers have software that correlates to a BRIX scale. In that case the software assumes that the index of refraction of the liquid presented to the refractometer corresponds to a sugar-water solution and will output a BRIX value (equal to the % sugar by weight in solution) based upon the measured refractive index. Unfortunately, for most other liquids, such as coffee, a BRIX scale is not valid and can lead to erroneous results. To configure refractometer 1000 to measure the TDS of a brewed coffee sample, process flow commences at start block 1105 in the flowchart of FIG. 11A. A user or other entity first calibrates refractometer 1000 , as per block 1110 . The calibration of refractometer 1000 is performed in the conventional manner by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. To correlate refractometer 1000 for coffee, the change in index of refraction with TDS as well as temperature is determined. The user or other entity begins correlation of refractometer 1000 , as per block 1115 . One exemplary and preferred method of determining the TDS of a coffee solution is through a dehydration method. To start the correlation procedure, different batches of coffee are brewed at different brew concentrations, while maintaining approximately the same extraction percentage from the selected batch of roasted and ground coffee beans, as per block 1120 . In other words, the user or other entity brews multiple coffee samples with different respective coffee concentrations in terms of total dissolved solids (TDS) %. The extraction percentage set during the refractometer correlation procedure is preferably the extraction percentage chosen as that of an ideal coffee solution for consumption. For purposes of example, the extraction percentage is 20%±1% although it is possible to employ other extraction percentages if desired depending on the application and user preference. For an accurate correlation procedure, it is preferable that the extraction percentage remains approximately constant because coffee grinds are composed of a mix of different materials that have different water solubility rates. The materials that have a high water solubility rate are extracted first from the coffee grinds and give the coffee a sweet flavor. Those materials that have a lower water solubility rate are extracted later in the brewing process and give the coffee a bitter flavor. Each of these different materials contained within coffee affect the index of refraction of water differently when they dissolve into it. Therefore for accurate correlation of the index of refraction of coffee to TDS, it is preferred that the extraction percentage is kept approximately constant. Note further that during the described correlation procedure it is preferred that the coffee used to make the different batches of coffee concentrations are from the same green and roast batch, and further, that they are ground to the same grade. For example, all-purpose universal Drip Grind would be derived of 8% Numbers 10/14 sieves, 65% Numbers, 27% Pan for a nominal particle size of 775 Microns (1 Micron−0.001 mm), according to the North American Coffee Industry Norms as published by Modern Process Equipment, Inc. If required, a separate correlation procedure can be conducted for each coffee bean of interest and/or different degrees of roast to determine refractometer correlation equations for these bean and roast changes. For the brew concentrations that have the same extraction percentage, it is preferred that they encompass the range of TDS expected for the consumable coffee of interest. By way of example, the brew samples can span a 0.8% to 4.0% TDS range, since 1% to 1.5% TDS represents the typical range for coffee, and 3% to 4% represents the typical range for ice coffee concentrate. For expresso, the brew concentration of 2 to 6% TDS is typically of interest with the TDS range of 4 to 5% being preferable. For expresso, given that it contains a certain percentage of undissolved solids, these solids would need to be filtered before following the dehydration procedure outlined below. Samples of each brew concentration are allowed to cool in respective sealed vial, as per block 1125 . Refractometer 1000 then measures not only the index of refraction of the sample but also the temperature of the sample. More particularly, refractometer 1000 measures the index of refraction (n s ) for each brew concentration sample across a range of temperatures as per block 1130 . For the correlation of refractometer 1000 for use outside of the brewing machine itself, a temperature range corresponding to ranges of ambient room temperatures are preferred such as 20 to 30° C. and index of refraction measurements can, for example, be taken in 1° C. increments. For a refractometer 1000 to be used to measure the index of refraction of coffee after it is brewed, the desired temperature range may be 70 to 90° C. with measurements taken every 2° C. as part of the correlation process. These correlation measurements are useful to derive the thermal dependence of the index of refraction for a specific brew concentration (i.e., a specific TDS). To determine the TDS of each of the brew concentrations, containers (for example, glass beakers) are marked and weighed (preferable to an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 or better), as per block 1135 (1 st weight reading). Portions of each brewed coffee solution are poured into individual containers (not shown) and the filled containers are reweighed (2 nd weight reading), as per block 1140 . The filled containers are then placed into a dehydration oven, as per block 1145 . After the solutions have been dehydrated or desiccated, the containers are allowed to cool in a dry environment in order to prevent any subsequent moisture absorption, as per block 1150 . The containers are then reweighed (3 rd weight reading) preferably in a dry environment, also as per block 1155 . From these three weight readings, the weight of the dissolved solids and the weight of the original solution is derived, and therefore the TDS (equal to the ratio of these two measurements) is derived. In more detail, assuming eight brewed samples of coffee of different TDS spanning 0.8 to 4.0% and ten temperature readings per sample, 80 data points are thus provided that map a three-dimensional space in TDS, temperature and refractive index. Taking TDS as the dependent variable, the TDS surface plot as a function of temperature and refractive index can be curve fit to find an equation that expresses TDS as a function of index of refraction (n) and temperature (T), (i.e. f(n, T)) as per block 1160 . Generally speaking, the curve fit of such data will be suitably fit by a linear function in index of refraction and a quadratic function of temperature. Curve fitting methods such as least squares, gradient descent, and others methods may be used. See for example, C. Daniel and F. S. Wood, Fitting Equations to Data: Computer Analysis of Multifactor Data , (John Wiley & Sons, NY, N.Y.), 1980] The TDS formula for a fixed temperature T 0 is given by EQUATION 9 below: T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , T 0 ) = [ n ⁡ ( T 0 ) - n 0 ⁡ ( T 0 ) ] C , EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 9 where n 0 is the index of refraction at which the curve fit indicates that the TDS is zero. Note that n 0 may not necessarily correspond with the exact index of refraction measured for pure water. Assuming that the range of index of refraction and hence TDS is relatively small, such as is the case for normal coffee, the constant C can be approximated to be temperature independent. In order to adjust for temperatures, the thermal dependence of index of refraction should be taken into account. The thermal dependence of index of refraction n for a fixed TDS coffee solution is approximated by a quadratic equation in temperature T according to EQUATION 10 below. n=n 0 +a ( T−T 0 )+ b ( T−T 0 ) 2 EQUATION 10 where a and b are constants derived from the curve fitting of data and the index of refraction equation is expressed such that at T=T 0 , the index of refraction is equal to n 0 . To the first order, the TDS formula that takes into account both index of refraction and temperature. for coffee is given by EQUATION 11 below. T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , T ) = [ n - n 01 - a 1 ⁢ ( T - T 0 ) - b 1 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 ] C 1 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 11 where n 01 , a 1 , b 1 , and C 1 may be slightly different from the constants n p , a, b, and C 1 of EQUATIONS. (3) and (4) depending upon the data fit. Although EQUATION 11 may be used, for a more accurate fit of the data, particularly for higher values of TDS, it is preferred to fit the data to a full quadratic in both index of refraction n and temperature T. Although such a quadratic equation can be expressed in multiple forms that are essentially identical from the standpoint of a refractometer's electronics and/or software calculating the result, a convenient form, from the standpoint of person reading the equation is given by EQUATION 12 below. T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , t ) = [ n - n 02 + d 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) 2 - a 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) - b 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 + e 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) ⁢ ( T - T 0 ) ] C 2 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 12 since the TDS is referenced to a control temperature T 0 and the index of refraction of n 02 , which is substantially equal to the index of refraction of pure water at a temperature T 0 , but may deviate slightly depending upon the empirical fit of the data in the index-temperature parameter space of interest. A formula such as the one represented in EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into the firmware 1085 or electronics of refractometer 1000 to correlate refractometer 1000 for the liquids (e.g., coffee), concentrations, and temperatures ranges of interest. In other words, the formula of either EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into, installed or otherwise stored in firmware 1047 of microcontroller 1045 in refractometer 1000 , as per block 1160 , for use in determining TDS of a particular coffee brew sample from index of refraction data and temperature data that refractometer 1000 provides. Storing the TDS formula of EQUATION 11 or 12 in refractometer 1000 in this manner completes the correlation of refractometer 100 for coffee solutions of interest. In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction, but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 or 12 provide respective polynomial expressions that approximate or represent TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATION 11 provides a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 12, TDS(n, T) varies as a quadratic function of index of refraction and also as a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 and 12 both provide a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). It should be noted that the previously cited equations are at a specific measurement wavelength since index of refraction of all materials, including coffee, will vary with the incident wavelength. Typically this wavelength is at or near the Sodium D line of 589 nm. However, other fixed wavelengths are acceptable as well. It is also noted that different coffee varieties, different degree of roasts, different levels of extraction during brew, extraction temperatures, and other brew variables can all affect the correlation to a small degree, such that some correlations of refractive index to brew solids may result in a better fit for darker versus lighter roasts. Separate scales for each range of degree of roasts may be correlated using Agtron or similar methods for determining the degree of roast. Microcontroller 1045 uses temperature sensor 1050 to determine and/or set the temperature of both the prism 1015 and the sample 1020 . Although not shown in FIG. 10A, microcontroller 1045 may control a resistive heater and thermo-electric cooler designed to bring the sample touching the prism face to a desired temperature. Since index of refraction changes with temperature and typically in a non-linear fashion, it is desirable to compensate for temperature effects. As such, in the design of the refractometer 1000 , it is desirable that the angles of incidences of the illumination beam at the entrance face of the prism and of the reflected beam at the exit face be minimized or at least compensated thermally since refraction at these interfaces will be a function of temperature. Likewise, the focal lengths of illumination lens 1010 and collection lens 1030 are a function of wavelength and to thermally compensate the temperature-dependent optical power, the lenses are preferably mounted to a mechanical mount whose thermal expansion compensates for the changes in the optical power of the lenses. Residual thermal changes to the refractometer's ability to measure index of refraction can be compensated using a lookup table based upon the readout of the temperature sensor 1050 that adds a correction factor to the critical angle detected by the refractometer. To increase the resolution of refractometer 1000 , the operating index of refraction range can be reduced and the number of detector pixels increased. Above, as a clarifying example, a refractometer was described that worked for a range of sugar solutions of 0 to 10° BRIX using an Eastman Kodak KLI-2113 linear CCD with 2098 pixels. The resolution for this example was stated as 1.4E-5 in index of refraction and 0.0095° BRIX. If instead, an Eastman Kodak Model KLI-8023 linear CCD having a length of 8002 pixels and the BRIX scale desired were reduced to 0 to 5° BRIX, the resolution can be improved by a factor of 7.6 to 1.8E-6 in index of refraction and 0.0013° BRIX. In an alternate embodiment the linear detector is not increased in size and in fact may be reduced in array size. To achieve a higher resolution the detector is scanned along the beam produced by illumination lens 1030 in order to locate the beam intensity transition point representing the critical angle. In order to properly read out the critical angle, the scanning detector should be mounted to an encoder to that its position is known.

It concerns a coffee machine according to the preamble to claim 1 . A coffee machine of this type is known, for example, from the publication WO-A1-93/19655. STATE OF THE ART With automatic coffee preparation by means of coffee-making machines or coffee-vending machines, in which the coffee in bean form is first ground in a grinder housed in the machine, the ground coffee powder is then placed in a brewing chamber and compacted therein, pressurized hot water is then supplied through the brewing chamber and, finally, upon completion of the brewing process, the remaining filter cake is pushed out of the brewing chamber and ejected into a collecting container, it is desirable, in spite of the complex preparation steps to be performed, to arrange the machine in a manner such that it is of simple construction, operates for the longest possible periods of time without malfunction or maintenance, and is easy to clean and to maintain. In the publication cited in the introduction, a coffee machine is now proposed, the central element of which is a removable brewing unit ( 1 in FIGS. 1 - 3 ). A base and a plunger are arranged so as to be displaceable along a main axis in this brewing unit and perform different movement sequences that are coordinated with one another. These travels are designed in a manner such that ground coffee powder placed in a filling chamber is transported into an adjacent brewing chamber and is compressed therein between the base and the plunger. Pressurized hot water is then passed through the cylindrical compressed powder in a radial direction. The brewed coffee produced is outlet from the brewing chamber radially and discharged downwards. Upon completion of the brewing process, the remaining filter cake is pushed out of the brewing chamber in an axial direction and is ejected transversely relative to the main axis by means of an ejector. The different travels of the base, of the plunger, and of the ejector are brought about by a common drive unit by means of a special mechanism which includes, amongst other things, two parallel racks engaged by a pinion. For a detailed explanation of the operation, reference should be made to the publication cited. As can be seen from FIGS. 1 and 4 of the publication and from the description on page 4 , last paragraph, the brewing unit is installed with its main axis, which corresponds to the direction of movement of the plunger, arranged transversely in the coffee machine, that is, the main axis extends parallel to the front of the machine. However, this arrangement has various disadvantages: owing to the displaceable arrangement of the base and of the plunger, as well as to the arrangement of the filling chamber, the brewing chamber, and the ejection region longitudinally relative to the main axis, the brewing unit reaches a relatively great length in the direction of the main axis, which length is effective as a width in the transverse installation described. Since, as well as the brewing unit, further functional units such as grinder, drive unit, water-heating unit, water reservoir, filter-cake collecting container, control electronics etc. are housed in the machine and must—at least partially—also be as accessible as possible from the front, the machine as a whole has a comparatively large width which is not always desirable. Basically, it would be possible to design the transversely installed brewing unit so that it could be pushed in from the side. However, in practice, this would mean that sufficient space would always have to remain clear beside the machine to permit unobstructed insertion or removal of the brewing unit. It is therefore usual to insert the transversely installed brewing unit directly transversely from the front and to remove it towards the front. However, the space in front of the brewing unit in the machine must consequently be kept free over the entire width of the brewing unit. A further problem arises in the coupling of the brewing unit, which has been removed and reinserted (for example, after cleaning), to the drive unit, which remains in the machine. In fact if, upon insertion, the movable elements (base, plunger, etc.) of the brewing unit adopt positions other than those adopted upon removal, the engagement point for the coupling is also displaced. An adjustment of the drive unit to the new engagement point, however, is difficult with the transverse installation of the brewing unit. Disadvantages owing to the transverse installation also arise with regard to the water supply: in order to limit, as far as possible, cooling of the brewed coffee on the path from the brewing chamber to the outlet, this path must be kept as short as possible. However, this means a radial flow through the brewing chamber which results in comparatively high flow resistances. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is therefore to provide an automatically operating coffee machine which has a compact brewing unit and which overcomes the disadvantages of known coffee machines and is characterized in particular by a simplified and space-saving design as well as easier accessibility for cleaning and maintenance purposes. The object is achieved by the features of claim 1 , taken as a whole. The essence of the invention is to design the brewing unit so that it can be pushed into the coffee machine from the front towards the rear with the main axis parallel to the direction of insertion. The brewing unit thereby requires only a small width of the machine both inside the machine and also during installation and removal. Moreover, this longitudinal insertion permits the arrangement under the brewing unit of suitable collecting containers which extend along the entire length of the brewing unit and thus offer protection against leakages in the brewing unit. A first preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that one or a plurality of guides, which extend parallel to the main axis of the brewing unit and are preferably bar-shaped, are provided for guiding the brewing unit during insertion in and removal from the coffee machine, and in that a catch is provided at the front end of the guide, for locking the inserted brewing unit. The guide facilitates the accurately positioned insertion of the brewing unit and thus ensures in a simple manner the mechanical and hydraulic connections between the brewing unit and the machine that are necessary for correct operation. A second preferred embodiment of the coffee machine according to the invention is characterized in that, in the brewing unit, the pressurized hot water is forced through the coffee powder disposed in the brewing chamber in the direction of the main axis, forwards from the rear and leaves through an outlet which is arranged at the front end of the brewing unit and is preferably adjustable in height, and in that the movable base and the plunger are equipped, on their surfaces facing the brewing chamber, with respective mesh plates through which the hot water enters the brewing chamber and the brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber, respectively. With the longitudinal configuration of the brewing unit according to the invention, with improved flow through the coffee powder, this enables advantageously short paths for the fluid to be achieved, which is of benefit to the quality of the brewed coffee. Another preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized in that the movable base and the plunger are driven by means of an actuating slide which is arranged so as to be displaceable in the direction of the main axis in the brewing unit and which is releasably in engagement with a driving dog which is situated on a threaded rod arranged parallel to the main axis and which can be displaced along the main axis by rotation of the threaded rod, and in that releasable engagement between the driving dog and the actuating slide is brought about by a latching hook which extends in the direction of the main axis and is arranged so as to be pivotable on the driving dog about a pivot axis arranged transversely relative to the main axis. The engagement between the driven dog and the inserted brewing unit can be re-established easily and automatically thereby, even if the engagement position has changed in the meantime. Particularly simple control of the compacting of the coffee powder can be achieved if, in addition, the threaded rod is mounted so as to be displaceable in the direction of the main axis against the pressure of a spring element, preferably a spring assembly, and if the displacement of the threaded rod against the pressure of the spring element or spring assembly, for a predetermined travel as established by the striking of the driving dog, of the actuating slide, or of the plunger, against a resistance, is used for the control or switching of the drive. The change in density arising in the moistened coffee powder can be compensated for and an optimal brewing process can thereby be ensured if the plunger is moved by means of a plunger actuator displaceable in the direction of the main axis and if the plunger is operatively connected to the plunger actuator by means of compression springs acting in the direction of the main axis. Preferably, the pressurized hot water is supplied into the brewing chamber through the plunger and a valve mechanism is arranged on the plunger, the valve mechanism being closed when the plunger presses on the coffee powder disposed in the brewing chamber with a predetermined pressure and relieving the pressure of the pressurized water and allowing the water to escape to the exterior when the pressure of the plunger on the coffee powder is removed. In particular, this is brought about by virtue of the fact that the valve mechanism includes valve push-rods which are arranged on the plunger actuator and which, upon sufficient compression of the compression springs, sealingly enter corresponding valve bores in the plunger, which valve bores are in communication with a hot-water supply duct. Preferably, the hot-water supply duct can extend directly through one of the valve push-rods and the valve bores can be in communication with the brewing chamber through a mesh plate.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INVENTION In FIG. 1, a coffee machine according to a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in the closed condition, in an overall view from the front. FIG. 2 shows a cross-section through the machine of FIG. 1 in the plane II-II. The coffee machine 10 has, at the top, a loading hopper 11 for the coffee beans to be ground. An associated grinder 24 is arranged beneath the loading hopper 11 . The coffee ground in the grinder 24 falls into a compact brewing unit 18 and is compacted therein in a brewing chamber ( 29 in FIGS. 3, 4). Pressurized hot water is then forced through the compressed powder. The resulting brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber through a spring-loaded creaming valve and is drawn off through an outlet 15 which projects forwards out of the coffee machine 10 and is preferably adjustable in height (pivotable), for example, into a cup which stands on a support surface 14 arranged beneath the outlet 15 . A steam/hot water nozzle 16 is arranged beside the outlet 15 for the foaming of milk (cappuccino) or for delivering hot water. The removable brewing unit 18 is covered at the front by a swivelling or removable cover 17 . An operating console 12 with the necessary operation and control elements is provided for the operation of the machine. A water container 13 that can be pulled out towards the front is arranged beneath the operating console 12 , for storing the water supply. A collecting container 48 for the filter cakes that are produced during the brewing process and are ejected from the brewing chamber is disposed on the left, beside the water container 13 , directly beneath the brewing unit 18 situated behind the cover 17 . The collecting container 48 can be pulled out towards the front by means of a gripping recess 49 . The collecting container 48 extends, together with an extension 50 formed on the rear region, beneath the brewing unit 18 along the entire length of the brewing unit 18 . If any leakages should occur in the brewing unit 18 , the collecting container 48 can thus also collect dripping water or coffee slops which can then easily be removed by pulling out the collecting container 48 together with the collected filter cakes. Permanent soiling of the coffee machine 10 can thus safely be prevented. The brewing unit 18 extends, according to FIGS. 3 and 4, along a main axis 48 . It includes, in addition to a filling chamber 30 and a brewing chamber 29 , a movable base 28 displaceable in the direction of the main axis 48 and a plunger 32 , also displaceable in the direction of the main axis 48 . As described in the publication cited in the introduction, the ground coffee powder falls out of the grinder 24 through a filling opening 31 into the filling chamber 30 . By a displacement of the plunger 32 towards the right (FIG. 3), the loaded coffee powder is pushed from the filling chamber 30 into the brewing chamber 29 where it is pressed against the movable base 28 and thereby compacted. Respective mesh plates 46 and 49 are secured on the end surfaces of the plunger 32 and of the movable base 28 (FIG. 4). Hot water is supplied into the brewing chamber 29 through the mesh plate 46 from the left, in an axial direction, through the plunger 32 . The brewed coffee leaves the brewing chamber 29 through the mesh plate 47 , axially towards the right, through the movable base 28 , and reaches the directly adjacent outlet 15 (FIG. 4). The brewing unit 18 is pushed into the coffee machine 10 in the longitudinal direction, that is, in the direction of the main axis 48 , from the front towards the rear (FIG. 2). For guiding the brewing unit 18 during insertion, use is made of one or a plurality of bar-shaped guide(s) 19 on the front end of which a (releasable) catch 20 for the brewing unit 18 is also arranged. The movable base 28 and the plunger 32 are moved, for example, by a rack mechanism as described by way of example in WO-A1-93/19655, of an actuating slide 27 arranged so as to be displaceable in the brewing unit 18 . The actuating slide 27 can be brought into engagement, by means of a releasable latching hook 26 , with a driving dog 25 which is situated on a rotatable threaded rod 21 which is driven by means of a drive wheel 22 of a drive motor, not shown. When the brewing unit 18 is pushed into the coffee machine 10 , the driving dog 25 moves towards the right, with the latching hook 26 , until the latching hook 26 has entered the actuating slide 27 and engaged therein. The engagement between the driving dog 25 and the actuating slide 27 can thus always safely be established, irrespective of exactly where the actuating slide 27 is disposed in the brewing unit 18 during insertion. The threaded rod 21 is arranged parallel to the guide 19 in the coffee machine 10 , is displaceable axially against the pressure of a spring assembly 23 composed of disc springs, and operates a microswitch (not shown) when the driving dog 25 strikes a resistance. In particular if, owing to compaction of the coffee powder, an opposing force builds up on the plunger 32 and thereby also on the driving dog 25 , the microswitch is operated when a predetermined value of that opposing force is exceeded. The compaction process can thus safely be controlled. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the plunger 32 is not coupled rigidly to the drive members but is connected, by means of two compression springs 42 , 43 , to a separate plunger actuator 33 which is driven by the actuating slide 27 . The compression springs 42 , 43 are situated with one end on two spring pins 40 , 41 (see also FIGS. 5 and 7) which are formed on the inner end surface of the plunger 32 . This spring coupling has a particular advantage: when the (dry) coffee powder is compacted, the drive switches off when a predetermined pressure is reached and the plunger actuator 33 and the plunger 32 come to a halt, in the course of which, owing to the prevailing pressure, the compression springs 42 , 43 are compressed to a predetermined extent. If the hot water is now forced through the brewing chamber 29 , owing to the moistening of the coffee powder, the density in the powder increases and the pressure in the powder decreases. The energy stored in the compression springs 42 , 43 then suffices to push the plunger 32 from behind and to compensate for the loss in volume so that the formation of undesired water channels past the coffee powder is safely prevented. The coupling described between the plunger 32 and the plunger actuator 33 by means of the compression springs 42 , 43 permits the simple construction of a valve mechanism which serves for the safe relief of the pressure from the pressurized water system upon completion of the brewing process. For this purpose, valve bores 44 , 45 with parallel axes are provided in the plunger 32 (FIGS. 3, 5 and 6 ); corresponding valve push-rods 36 , 37 arranged on the plunger actuator 33 (FIG. 3) enter the valve bores 44 , 45 sealingly when the compression springs 42 , 43 are sufficiently greatly compressed. Sealing takes place by means of O-rings (not shown) which are inserted in corresponding grooves 38 , 39 on the valve push-rods 36 , 37 . One of the valve push-rods, that is the valve push-rod 36 , also serves as an (axial) supply duct 34 for the hot water. Moreover, connection to the hot water system of the coffee machine 10 is established by means of a fluid-tight plug-type connection 35 which is operated upon the insertion of the brewing unit 18 in the machine. If, upon completion of a brewing process, the plunger actuator 33 with the plunger 32 is withdrawn, the compression springs 42 , 43 are released and the valve push-rods 36 , 37 move out of the valve bores 44 , 45 so that residual pressurized hot water can come out of the supply duct 34 , with pressure relief, into the space between the plunger actuator 33 and the plunger 32 , from where it can be discharged to the exterior.

No. 12/753,332, filed Apr. 2, 2010, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/168,027, filed Apr. 9, 2009, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/318,028, filed Mar. 26, 2010, the entire disclosures of both of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers may find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced in which the coffee is provided in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, is provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are designed for only a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. SUMMARY In accordance with this invention, coffee tablets for use in a conventional automatic drip coffee maker are provided. A first exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which at least a first compression and a separate second compression are carried out in the same compaction die in such a manner that the coffee tablet obtained exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an automatic drip coffee maker (ADC). A second exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which a pre-compression step is carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step so that the coffee tablet obtained exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A third exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee, has a density of at least 0.95 g/cm 3 , and exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A fourth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and at least 1.5 wt. % propylene glycol, and exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A fifth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and at least 1.5 wt. % of a liquid flavor carrier, and exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A sixth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and an amount of instant coffee large enough to improve at least one mechanical property of the tablet selected from binding strength, ease of disintegration, and brewing efficiency (as determined by the amount of coffee solids extracted from the tablet when subjected to brewing in an ADC). A seventh exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee, and exhibits a hardness of at least about 50 N (Newtons) and a friability of no greater than about 3.5%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. An eighth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee, has a mass less than about 4 g, and exhibits a friability of no greater than about 6% and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, wherein ten (10) of the tablets, unbroken, are capable of brewing with 1420 ml of water in an automatic drip coffee maker a consumable coffee beverage having an absorbance of 1.1-3.5 or 1.25-2.75 or 1.7-2.5, and wherein the coffee tablets exhibit a yield greater than 26% when brewed in the ADC. A ninth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and exhibits a friability of no greater than about 6%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, wherein ten (10) of the tablets, unbroken, are capable of brewing with 1420 ml of water in an automatic drip coffee maker a consumable coffee beverage having an absorbance per gram of >0.07 or >0.09, and wherein the coffee tablets exhibit a yield greater than 26% when brewed in the ADC. A tenth exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which at least a first compression and a separate second compression are carried out in the same compaction die in such a manner that the coffee tablet obtained exhibits a hardness of at least about 40 N (Newtons) and a friability of no greater than about 6%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. An eleventh exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which a pre-compression step is carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step wherein the pre-compression compaction force is ˜20% to <100%, ˜30% to ˜90%, ˜40% to ˜80%, or ˜50% to ˜75%, or ˜50% to ˜60% of the compaction force used in the main compression step. A twelfth exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which a pre-compression step is carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step wherein the pre-compression pressure is ˜20% to <100%, ˜30% to ˜90%, ˜40% to ˜80%, or ˜50% to ˜75%, or ˜50% to ˜60% of the pressure used in the main compression step. An exemplary process for producing a coffee tablet includes subjecting ground roast coffee to a multi-step compaction process including a pre-compression step and a subsequent main compression step, the pre-compression step being carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step so as to produce a coffee tablet exhibiting a hardness when dry of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability when dry of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in the ADC.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Terminology Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Binder” means a material which improves the strength of the ground roast coffee tablets made in accordance with this invention. “Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. Historically in the United States, one pound (16 ounces or 454 g) of ground roast coffee had a standard density of ˜4-0.4 g/cc and a conventional moisture content of about 1-7%. However, technologies have allowed lower density coffees to be made, so today a more standard density is ˜0.33 g/cc. Even lower densities are possible, such as ˜0.263 g/cc. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee tablet means that the coffee tablet is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the tablet, when the tablet is contacted with hot water for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3%) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3-5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cc to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5-6 fluid ounces (˜150-175 ml) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (˜55 ml) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to 5-6 fluid ounces (˜150-175 ml) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (˜55 ml) of espresso strength brewed coffee. Automatic Drip Coffee Makers This invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures may be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing may include about 70-120° C., about 80-110° C., about 80-100° C., or about 90-100° C. Normally, the ground roast coffee is deposited in a “brew basket,” i.e., a container having an open top and a floor defining one or more outlet openings, the brew basket containing a paper or metal mesh or plastic mesh coffee filter in most instances. Brew baskets are often shaped in the form of a truncated cone or other similar wedge shapes, so that their side walls direct flow to the more confined area of the containers' floor. The most common brew baskets are referred to as “basket” style and “cone” style. Once activated, the machine automatically heats water previously placed in its water reservoir and then causes this heated brewing water to drip down onto the coffee bed in the brew basket over a suitable period of time (the “brewing cycle time”). Another style of machine has a reservoir of hot water that is displaced by new water added. In either case, the machine delivers hot water at or slightly above atmospheric pressure, which is somewhat below boiling to about boiling, to the brew basket. As the water passes through the coffee bed, coffee flavor solids are extracted from the ground roast coffee, thereby producing brewed coffee. The brewed coffee so made then passes through the coffee filter and then through the outlet opening or openings in the brew basket, where it is collected in a suitable carafe normally positioned below the outlet opening or openings. Automatic drip coffee makers come in many different sizes. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce 4-12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. A first variation of automatic drip coffee makers have an option for brewing one to three standard servings. A second variation of automatic drip coffee makers, typically known as “4 cup” brewers, are designed to brew up to four standard servings. A few are even capable of brewing a single cup, although these are typically high pressure brewers and not “drip” brewers. Automatic drip coffee makers for commercial or industrial use are typically designed for producing 10 to 30 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The inventive ground roast coffee tablets can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and may be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. While the inventive coffee tablets of the present application may advantageously be used with many different types of coffee makers, including many different types of automatic drip coffee makers, the specific brew performance characteristics (e.g., yield, % brew solids, total brew solids, absorbance, etc.) described herein correspond to brewing the inventive coffee tablets in a 4-12 cup automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5 g/sec to 3.1 g/sec, for example, a water delivery rate of about 2.7 to 2.8 g/sec. Two such ADC's are the Mr. Coffee® Model DR13 coffee maker and the Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) coffee maker, both of which have a water delivery rate of approximately 2.75 g/sec. As expected, ADC's having substantially higher water delivery rates may produce lower total extraction (and corresponding lower brew solids concentrations, yields, and absorbances), as the faster flowing water has less time to absorb the coffee solids. However, relative to the brew performance of the corresponding roasted and ground coffee under the same brewing conditions, the relative brew solids indices, yield ratios, or absorbance ratios of coffee brewed using an ADC with a higher water delivery rate (for example, the Bunn® Pour-Omatic GR, having a water delivery rate of approximately 10 to 11 g/sec) may be comparable to those described herein for ADC's having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5 g/sec to 3.1 g/sec. Ingredients The coffee tablets of this invention can be made from virtually any type of ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “ Arabica (s)”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “ Robusta (s)”). Coffees from the species arabica may be described as “Brazils,” which come from Brazil, or “Other Milds” which are grown in other premium coffee producing countries. Premium Arabica countries are generally recognized as including Colombia, Guatemala, Sumatra, Indonesia, Costa Rica, Mexico, United States (Hawaii), El Salvador, Peru, Kenya, Ethiopia and Jamaica. Coffees from the species canephora var. robusta are typically used as a low cost extender or as a source of additional caffeine for Arabica coffees. These Robusta coffees are typically grown in the lower regions of West and Central Africa, India, South East Asia. Indonesia, and Brazil. See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of coffees can be used to make the inventive coffee tablets. One ground roast coffee without any binder or liquid flavor carrier acting as a binder resulted in tablets with very poor hardness and friability. This coffee had a coffee bulk density of about 0.353 g/cm 3 , a moisture content of about 2.2%, and a relatively high percentage of “fines.” While not intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the combination of low moisture, high density, and a high fines percentage combined to cause these relatively poor results. Mixtures of different coffee varieties and types can also be used. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12%. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology, “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112-169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. After drying to a moisture content of about 12%, the coffee beans are typically exported to consuming nations where they are processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of this invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans may be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8-371.1° C. (350-700° F.), or about 176.8-260° C. (350-500° F.), or about 204.4-232.2° C. (400-450° F.), or about 260-287.8° C. (500-550° F.), or about 315.6-348.9° C. (600-660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and may, for example, be about 10-20 minutes or about 12-18 minutes, or may be about 2-10 minutes, or about 2-6 minutes, or about 2-4 minutes, or about 2-3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and may, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1-3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° to about 1200° F. (about 177° C. to about 649° C.) preferably from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, preferably from about 10 to about 47 seconds. As well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer ., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee used to make the inventive coffee tablets can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, preferably from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, and even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as 250 μm (microns) and as high as 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of 400 μm to 1,000 μm, 500 μm to 800 μm, and even 650 μm to 750 μm, 800 μm to 950 μm, and 850 μm to 900 μm are more interesting. The coffee beans may be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to 1.5 mm, or about 300 μm to about 1.000 μm, or even about 1-2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles may be broken down during tablet compaction, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the compacted coffee tablet. The ground roast coffee tablets of this invention can be made from ground roast coffees ground to any of these particle sizes. Coffee flakes can also be used. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by breadth of distribution. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with this invention, the inventive coffee tablets can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/cc to 0.35 g/cc such as, for example, 0.263 g/cc, 0.288 g/cc, 0.325 g/cc, and 0.35 g/cc, if desired. Alternatively, the inventive coffee tablets can also be made for ground roast coffees having greater or lesser densities, if desired. For example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from high density coffees having densities of >0.4 g/cc, e.g., densities of up to ˜0.6 g/c, although even higher densities are contemplated. Similarly, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from low density coffees having densities of <0.18 g/cc to 0.26 g/cc, e.g., densities of 0.18 g/cc to 0.26 g/cc, 0.20 g/cc to 0.25 g/cc, or even 0.22 g/cc to 0.23 g/cc (such as ˜0.19 g/cc, ˜0.20 g/cc, ˜0.21 g/cc, ˜0.22 g/cc, ˜0.23 g/cc, ˜0.24 g/cc or even ˜0.25 g/cc). In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of ˜1 to ˜7 wt. %, ˜2 to ˜7 wt. %, ˜2 to ˜6 wt. %, ˜3 to ˜6 wt. % and ˜4 to ˜5.5 wt. %. Some ground roast coffees having a moisture content less than ˜2.5 wt. % may not make tablets with acceptable friability without the use of a binder or liquid flavor carrier acting as a binder; thus, any of these ranges might have a lower boundary of ˜2.5 wt. %. Generally speaking, the inventive coffee tablets can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. In addition to the above ground roast coffees, additional ingredients can be included in the ground roast coffee tablets of this invention. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the inventive ground roast coffee tablets. (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context.) Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included. Examples of suitable solid particulate binders include starches, sugars, modified starches, maltrodextrins, polydextroses, carrageenans, gums, soluble fibers, celluloses, waxes, gelatin, sugars, including sucrose, glucose, dextrose, molasses and lactose, natural and synthetic gums, including acacia sodium alginate, extract of Irish moss, panwar gum, ghatti gum, mucilage of isapol husks, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, Veegum, larch arabogalactan, polyethyleneglycol, ethylcellulose, any salts of these compounds, and mixtures thereof can be included as binders. More interesting solid binders are carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, maltodextrin, gelatin, gum arabic, gum agar, modified corn starch, and mixtures thereof. See, for example, EP 813816 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,431, U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,428, EP 0229920 and U.S. Pat. No. 1,951,357. Surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee tablets. Suitable liquid flavor carriers include those having viscosities of 15 to 65 cP (centipoise), 35 to 65 cP, 40 to 60 cP, or even 45 to 56 cP and surface tensions of 30 to 50 dynes/cm, 35 to 45 dynes/cm, or even 35 to 40 dynes/cm at 25 C. Propylene glycol is a good example of a liquid flavor carrier that acts as a binder in coffee tablets. Other examples include but are not limited to glycerin, other polyols, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Binders, if used, will normally be present in an amount of ≦˜10 wt. %, ˜0.5 to ˜7 wt. %, ˜1 to ˜5 wt. %, or even ˜1.5 to 4 wt. %, or even ˜2 to ˜4 wt. %, based on the weight of the entire composition. However, addition of one or more binders is not required, and indeed in many embodiments the inventive coffee tablets are essentially free of binders. Mixtures of all of the above ingredients, i.e., mixtures of different ground roast coffees, different ground roast decaffeinated coffees, different ground roast coffee substitutes, different flavorings and/or different excipients, can also be used. If so, the amount of ground roast coffee (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the ground roast coffee solid used to make the inventive ground roast coffee tablets will normally be at least about 50 wt. %, more typically at least about 75 wt. %, at least about 80 wt. %, at least about 85 wt. %, at least about 90 wt. %, at least about 91 wt. %, at least about 92.5 wt. %, or even at least about 95 wt. %, based on the weight of the tablets ultimately produced. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, it is also desirable at least in some embodiments that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular.” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. Embodiments in which at least 5 wt. %, at least 10 wt. %, at least 25 wt. %, at least 50 wt. %, at least 75 wt. %, or even at least 90 wt. % of the ground roast coffee in the inventive tablets is decaffeinated are contemplated, as are embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the tablets is decaffeinated. Tablet Size and Configuration Although the inventive coffee tablets can be made in any size, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produce a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the inventive coffee tablets may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, the inventive coffee tablets may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and may be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to preferentially break the tablets into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e. break the tablet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the inventive coffee tablets may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as ½ of a standard serving, or ⅓ of standard serving, or ¼ of standard serving. If so, the inventive coffee tablets will contain a correspondingly greater or lesser amount of ground roast coffee. This does not necessarily mean that using one single coffee tablet designed to produce a single standard serving in a standard automatic drip coffee maker will necessarily always result in one single serving of acceptable brewed coffee. Many standard automatic drip coffee makers are configured to make, at minimum, more than one serving of coffee at a time, e.g., four (4) servings of coffee at a minimum, and the inventive coffee tablets are not necessarily able to overcome that limitation of such coffee brewers. For such tablets designed to produce a single standard serving of coffee, one would expect, for example, four of such tablets to produce four servings of acceptable brewed coffee, five of such tablets to produce five servings of acceptable brewed coffee, seven of such tablets to produce seven servings of acceptable brewed coffee, etc. For an automatic drip coffee maker designed to brew one serving of coffee at a time, one may be expected to use one tablet per serving. Of course, the consumer may add or reduce these numbers to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference (e.g., any one or more or fewer tablets than this one-tablet-per-serving ratio, such as five tablets to make four servings, six tablets to make four servings, three tablets to make four servings, etc.). As indicated above, different ground coffees exhibit different densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. A typical ground roast coffee having a density of 0.33 g/cc and a standard moisture content of about 1-7% requires approximately 3 grams to produce a standard serving of brewed coffee, both regular and espresso strength, at least in the United States. Thus, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets, when designed to produce one standard serving of brewed coffee per tablet, will normally contain about 3±1 grams of ground roast coffee, based on a density of 0.33 g/cc and a standard moisture content of about 1-7%, more typically about 3±0.5 grams of ground roast coffee. Exemplary inventive coffee tablets may have a mass of less than about 4 grams, less than about 3.5 grams, less than about 3.3 grams, less than about 2.7 grams, about 2.6 to 2.8 grams, or even a mass of about 1.9 grams to about 2.7 grams. Ground roast coffees of greater or less densities, e.g., 0.288 g/cc, (and greater or lesser moisture contents, as further discussed below) require correspondingly less or greater amounts of coffee to produce a standard serving of brewed coffee. When a ground roast coffee having a density of 0.33 g/cc and a standard moisture content of about 1-7% is used for producing a single standard serving of coffee, approximately 3 grams of this coffee will be required, as indicated above. This volume of ground roast coffee will produce a generally cylindrical tablet measuring approximately 25 mm in diameter and 6-7 mm in thickness when compacted in a typical compaction process carried out in accordance with this invention, as further described below. When coffees of different densities and/or moisture contents are used, correspondingly different tablet volumes will be achieved. Similarly, inventive tablets made with different dose sizes, e.g., a tablet made to produce ⅓ of a standard serving of brewed coffee per tablet, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different tablet configurations are also possible. For example, oval, heart, “pillow” and other shapes are anticipated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical tablet may be concave. Additionally or alternatively, the outer surface of a tablet may have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Packaging and Use The inventive ground roast coffee tablets are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. If desired, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets can be packaged in specific numbers for making predetermined amounts of coffee. For example, tablets designed to produce a single serving of coffee per tablet can be packaged in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle. Alternatively, three tablets designed to produce ⅓ serving of coffee per tablet can be packaged in groups of three to facilitate making a single serving of coffee in a single brew cycle. The tablet packages can be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the tablets are periodically used by the consumer, the unused tablets that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. A particular advantage of this invention is that, because the inventive coffee tablets contain a predetermined amount of ground roast coffee (and other optional ingredients), adjusting dosages to achieve the precise flavor desired, including combining different inventive coffee tablets in the same brew, is made much easier. So for example, a consumer desiring to make a stronger brewed coffee than normal can use five inventive coffee tablets (of a single serving size) rather than four for brewing four servings of brewed coffee. Similarly, a consumer desiring to make a brewed coffee having a reduced caffeine content and a “hint” of French vanilla flavor can use three inventive coffee tablets made from regular ground roast coffee, two tablets made from decaffeinated coffee, and one tablet of French vanilla flavored coffee. Thus, method of brewing coffee are contemplated comprising (a) placing at least one or a portion of one of a first type of coffee tablet (flavored or unflavored) and at least one or a portion of one of a second (flavored or unflavored) type of coffee tablet into an ADC coffee maker and (b) actuating a brew cycle of the ADC coffee maker to brew coffee with the coffee tablets or coffee tablet portions. A further advantage of the inventive coffee tablets is that they are smaller in size than conventional ground roast coffee on a comparable basis, i.e., based on the same amount of coffee provided. This allows the inventive coffee tablets to be marketed, transported and sold in smaller packages, which in turn is beneficial for the environment. Tablets with a volume less than 3.2 cm 3 , less than 2.9 cm 3 , and less than 2.3 cm 3 are of particular interest. In use, the appropriate number of tablets will be removed from their package(s), manually placed in the brew basket of an automatic drip coffee maker, and then brewed into brewed coffee in the normal way. Tablet Manufacture In accordance with this invention, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with hot brewing water at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated above. In addition, they are also made to resist significant degradation from the manual handling they receive during manufacture and use. In particular, the inventive coffee tablets are made to have sufficient hardness and friability before brewing to withstand all aspects of manufacture, handling, packaging, transport and use without breakage to any significant degree. This is accomplished in accordance with this invention by making the inventive ground roast coffee tablets by multi-step compaction, i.e., by compressing ground roast coffee into shaped articles by a multi-step compaction process carried out in the same compaction die in which the ground roast coffee is compressed at a first compaction pressure and then subsequently further compressed at least one more time in the same compaction die. Many of the tablets herein discussed were made in multi-step compaction process carried out in the same compaction die in which the ground roast coffee is pre-compressed at a relatively lower compaction pressure and then subsequently further compressed at a relatively higher pressure in a main or primary compaction step. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that this approach allows stronger tablets to be produced than would otherwise by the case if an otherwise identical tablet having an otherwise identical density were made by a single-step compaction process. That is to say, coffee tablets made by the inventive multi-step compaction process are stronger (as measured by hardness, friability or both, as further discussed below) than otherwise identical tablets having the same density but made by a conventional single-step compaction process. In the alternative, tablets can be made using a multi-step compaction process carried out in the same compaction die in which the ground roast coffee is compressed at a relatively higher compaction pressure initially and then subsequently further compressed at a relatively lower pressure in a separate compaction step. This second approach may be problematic for some machines, because they use a measured highest compaction force or pressure to control how much material is deposited into the die (with a higher than desired force indicating that too much material has been deposited) and controlling based on a higher pre-compression may be less accurate than controlling based on a higher main compression. Although many of the examples herein are carried out with a relatively lower compaction pressure initially and then subsequently further compressed at a relatively higher pressure in a separate compaction step, and much of the teachings herein are in this context, it is to be understood that many of the advantages taught herein can be obtained using three or more total compactions in the same die and/or a relatively higher compaction pressure at other than the final compression step, and the virtually any of the methods herein can be thought of as being capable of being carried out using three or more total compactions in the same die and/or a relatively higher compaction pressure at other than the final compression step (e.g., first or second or third non-final compression). Although the inventive multi-step compaction process will normally be carried out with two compaction steps, one, two, three or more additional, intermediate compaction steps can also be used, usually at compaction pressures between the compaction pressures encountered in the pre-compression and main compression steps. However, greater or lesser compaction pressures can also be used in the intermediate compaction steps, if desired. Compressive or compaction forces on the order of ˜25 to ˜80 kN (kiloNewtons), ˜35 to ˜65 kN, or even ˜40 to ˜50 kN have been found suitable for the main compression step (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm). Thus, these main compressive forces will normally be >˜25 kN, >˜35 kN, >˜40 kN, and, in addition, generally <˜80 kN, <˜55 kN, or even <˜50 kN. Expressed as applied pressure during compaction (assuming a 24.5 mm tablet diameter), the corresponding compressions would be >˜53.0 MPa (or N/mm 2 ), >˜74.2 MPa, >˜84.8 MPa, and, in addition, generally <˜169.6 MPa, <˜116.7 MPa, or even <˜106.1 MPa. Greater or lesser compressive forces can be used depending on the type, particle size and other properties of the ground roast coffee being processed, the desired density, strength and hardness of the coffee tablet being produced, and certain production variables as further discussed below, and can easily be determined by routine experimentation based on the teachings herein. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tabletted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. Presses may be single station or multiple station. In this context, a “station” refers to a single die and its associated top and bottom tools. In a single station press, a single stationary die is used, and all functions (e.g., filling, compression and ejection) occur in the same location. In a multiple station press such as a rotary tablet press, multiple sets of dies and their associated top and bottom tools are moved from location to location where the separate functions of filling, pre-compression, main compression and ejection occur. For example, a typical rotary table press has a turret containing a die table formed from multiple die stations. The turret containing the die table rotates through the press so that each die is serially brought to the different filling, pressing and ejection locations in the press. Dies are filled at the filling location, the material to be tabletted compacted in the pre-compression and main compression locations, and the tablet formed thereby ejected from the die at the ejection location. Actuation of the top and/or bottom tools for compressing the material to be compacted in the pre-compression and main compression locations can be done in a variety of different ways, including using cams, ramps, compression rollers or combinations thereof, all of which are designed to force the bottom and top tools associated with each die together. The size of the compression rollers or other tool compressing mechanisms may limit the proximity of the pre-compression and main compression locations, which may, for example, be separated by approximately ¼ of the die circle circumference. While the coffee material may be under compression during this delay period, in one embodiment, the die tools may be held in proximity to the compression positions without exerting additional compaction forces, for example, by holding the tools using tracks, ramps, or other mechanisms provided with the rotary tablet press. This delay between pre-compression and main compression steps may have a duration of approximately 80-900 milliseconds, or 150-400 milliseconds, or 200-290 milliseconds, under normal rotary tablet press operating speeds (e.g., 15-60 rpm), or about 15-23 times either of the pre-compression and/or the main compression dwell times. Therefore, while each of the pre-compression and main compression steps may be very brief (for example, pre-compression and main compression dwell times ranging from 7-45 milliseconds), the total time from the start of the pre-compression step to the completion of the main compression step may be 8-15 times the total time under compression at the pre-compression and main compression rollers. This total compression time may be, for example, approximately 0.1 to 1 second, approximately 0.18 to 0.5 seconds, or 0.22 to 0.36 seconds. As such, even minor adjustments to the dwell times of the pre-compression and main compression steps may result in significant changes to the tablet production rates, as adjustments to the rotary press operating speed are generally proportional to these dwell time adjustments. In a typical rotary press, each die is subjected to one set of compressions, for production of one table, per die, in a single, 360° revolution of the turret. In other rotary presses, additional filling, compression and ejection locations may be provided for production of two or more tablets, per die, in a single 360° revolution of the turret. While pre-compression locations have been included in typical rotary tablet presses, the amount of pre-compression forces applied during prior art tabletting has generally been minimal, the purpose of which being to force or squeeze pockets of air out of the powder to be tabletted, to prevent voids or fractures in the resulting tablet. Generally speaking, longer compression dwell times require less compression force in the main or primary compression step. Some increases in dwell time may be accomplished by increasing the size of the portions of the tools impacted by the compression rollers or other compression mechanism, often referred to as the tool heads. However, more substantial increases in compression dwell time typically require slower machine operating speeds, such that the top and bottom tools are aligned with the compression rollers (or other compression mechanism) for the desired dwell time period. As such, a substantially longer dwell time for compaction of the tablet generally limits the tablet production rate by requiring a substantially slower machine operating speed, thereby slowing down other steps of the tabletting process (e.g., filling, pre-compression, or ejection of completed tablet). As further indicated above, the compressive forces used for a particular application of this invention also depend on the desired properties of the inventive ground roast coffee tablets to be produced. In this regard, it has been found that, within certain limits, greater compressive forces lead to stronger tablets, and conversely, lesser or reduced compressive forces lead to weaker tablets. On the other hand, compressive forces which are too high can weaken the tablet. Indeed, reliance on increases in compressive forces alone, without regard to dwell time, amount of pre-compression, or other such factors, may be insufficient to produce tablets of desired strength, as shown, for example, in the working examples (see, e.g., Example 14). The strength/robustness of the ground roast coffee tablets of this invention can conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a tablet's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the tablet in an axial direction. Tablet hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the tablet is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the tablet breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the tablet to break is taken as the hardness of the tablet, which is sometimes referred to as the “tablet crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. In accordance with this invention, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets are normally made to have a hardness of ≧˜30 N (Newtons) when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses on the order of ≧˜40 N, or ≧˜50 N, are even more interesting, while hardnesses of ≧˜60 N, ≧˜70 N, ≧˜80 N, ≧˜90 N, ≧˜100 N, and even ≧˜110 N and more are possible. Friability measures the amount of material that flakes, falls, or chips off the tablets after being tumbled under a predetermined set of conditions. For convenience, the friability of the inventive coffee tablets can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating 25 grams of the tablets in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these tablets that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The tablets should not be broken to obtain 25 grams, but adjust the number of whole tablets to come as close as possible to 25 grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of tablets represents the friability of these tablets. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that the inventive coffee tablets, when made in the manner indicated above, may have a friability of <˜10%, <˜8%, <˜6%, <˜3.5%, <˜3%, or even <˜1%. Generally speaking, coffee tablets having the above combination of properties, i.e., a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons) and a friability of less than about 10%, will have a density on the order of ≧0.85 g/cm 3 , ≧0.87 g/cm 3 , ≧0.90 g/cm 3 , ≧0.92 g/cm 3 , ≧0.95 g/cm 3 , ≧0.97 g/cm 3 , and even ≧0.99 g/cm 3 . Coffee tablets having densities of ≧0.90 g/cm 3 , ≧0.92 g/cm 3 , ≧0.95 g/cm 3 , ≧0.97 g/cm 3 , and even ≧0.99 g/cm 3 are especially interesting. An external coating can enhance the tablet strength, allowing tabletting at a reduced compaction force. Any material described above as useful for making a binder to be included in the inventive coffee tablets can be used for making such coatings. In accordance with this invention, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets are made to have the above properties by using a multi-step compaction process comprising two or more compression steps, a pre-compression step, a main or primary compression step, and optionally, one or more intermediate compression steps, all of which are carried out in the same die. In other words, once the ground roast coffee is filled into a particular compaction die, it is subjected to all of the compactions steps need to produce a completed coffee tablet in that same die before being ejected therefrom. In general, this approach allows lower compression forces to be used in the main compression step, which in turn places less stress on the press. In addition, this approach also allows for reduced compression dwell times, as compared to the extended dwell times generally associated with lower compression forces, which enables faster press operation. Finally, as indicated above, this approach also allows stronger tablets to be produced (for a given tablet density) than otherwise identical tablets made by a single-step compaction process. When using this approach, the pre-compression force is desirably at least about 5 kN (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm), or about a 10.6 MPa pre-compression pressure (for a 24.5 mm diameter tablet). A pre-compression force this low may require the use of a binder or a liquid flavor carrier with binder properties to provide tablets with acceptable friability and hardness at relatively high manufacture rates per die (as suggested by the data below, use of some binders or liquid flavor carriers with binder properties might also permit tablets made with a single compression to obtain acceptable friability and hardness at relatively high manufacture rates per die). Additionally, compressive forces on the order of ˜25 kN, ˜35 kN, ˜12 to ˜40 kN, ˜18 to ˜35 kN, or even ˜25 to ˜35 kN have been found suitable for this pre-compression step (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm). Thus, these pre-compressive forces will normally be ˜25 kN, ˜30 kN, or >˜12 kN, >˜17 kN, >˜18 kN, >˜20 kN, >˜25 kN, >˜35 kN and, in addition, generally <˜40 kN, <˜35 kN, or even <˜30 kN. Expressed as applied pressure during compaction (assuming a 24.5 mm tablet diameter), the corresponding pre-compressions would be ˜53.0 MPa (or N/mm 2 ), ˜63.6 MPa, or >˜25.5 MPa, >˜36.1 MPa, >˜38.2 MPa, >˜42.4 MPa, >˜53.0 MPa, >˜74.2 MPa and, in addition, generally <˜84.8 MPa, <˜74.2 MPa, or even <˜63.6 MPa. Expressed as a percentage of main compression force, pre-compressive forces of about 20-100%, 30-90%, 40-80%, or even 50-75% of main compression force have been found suitable for the pre-compression step (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm). Thus, these pre-compressive forces will normally be >˜20%, >˜30%, or >˜40% and, in addition, generally <˜100%, <˜90%, or even <˜80% of the main compression force. Greater or lesser compressive forces can be used depending on the type, particle size and other properties of the ground roast coffee being processed, the desired density, strength and hardness of the coffee tablet being produced, and certain production variables as further discussed below, and can easily be determined by routine experimentation based on the teachings herein. In this regard, FIG. 1 shows the effect of altering the pre-compression force on the hardness, friability and extraction efficiency of the inventive ground roast coffee tablets obtained. This figure was developed from experiments in which a group of coffee tablets was produced by a two-step compaction process in which the tablet was first subjected to a pre-compression force ranging from ˜0.3 kN to ˜50 kN and thereafter subjected to a main compression force in the same compression die ranging from ˜10 to ˜70 kN. The data in FIG. 1 has been normalized to values observed with very low/no initial compression being taken as equal to 1. As shown in FIG. 1, when the pre-compression force used to make the inventive coffee tablets is varied between ˜20% to ˜100% of the main compression force, the hardness of the tablets produced increases by as much as 40% (at a pre-compression/main compression ratio of about 0.70), while the friability of the tablets produced is reduced by as much as 80% (at a pre-compression/main compression ratio of about 0.55). This makes it possible in accordance with this aspect of the invention to design the inventive coffee tablets having a predetermined combination of hardness and friability, as desired. As indicated above, one advantage of using the inventive multi-step compaction process for manufacturing the inventive coffee tablets, at least when this is done using a multiple station press, is that press operation is faster than would otherwise be the case if a single step compaction process were used. This is made possible because less compaction force can be used in the main or primary compaction step than would be required if compaction occurred in a single compaction step. In addition, using a multiple compaction steps allows the dwell time needed in the primary or main compactions step, i.e., the amount of time the ground roast coffee remains under compaction, to be less than that required if only a single compaction step were used. In this regard, see WO 2008/107342, which makes clear that in order to make a ground roast coffee tablet of sufficient strength using single step compaction (in which pre-compression is minimal or non-existent), the ground roast coffee must be compressed at a fairly slow rate (i.e., over the course of 0.1 to 2 seconds, preferably 0.2 to 0.8 seconds) and then held at its final volume for an additional significant period of time (i.e., for 0.2 to 5 second, preferably 0.3 to 2 seconds, and even more preferably 0.5 to 1.5 seconds). In contrast, the inventive process described herein uses a multi-step compaction approach that does not employ slow compression and an extended dwell time at final volume. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that pre-compression “prepares” the ground coffee for final compaction in such a way that less compaction pressure for a shorter period of time is necessary to produce a fully compacted tablet. This pre-compression preparation of the ground coffee, combined with a desired main compaction of the coffee tablet, as provided for in the production of the inventive coffee tablets, is believed to strike a balance between a number of factors believed to have an impact on the physical properties and the brew performance of the tablets, including, for example, tablet strength/robustness, tablet density, table porosity (including the degree of hydrophobicity, the diameter, the length, and/or the orientation of channels and passages on the surface of and within the body of tablet), particle sizes of the coffee from which the tablets are composed, water permeability, and water vapor permeability. When brewed in certain coffee makers where the tablets are exposed to steam during the brewing process (e.g.: automatic drip coffee makers), the water vapor permeability is believed to play a significant role in brew performance. Thus, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the inventive multi-step compaction process is carried out in such a way that the dwell time of the ground roasted coffee in the main compaction step, i.e., the period of time in which the coffee is under active compression in the main compaction step, is ≦˜0.3 second, ≦˜0.25 second, ≦˜0.2 second, ≦˜0.15 second, or even ≦˜0.1 second. Indeed, dwell times on the order of ≦75 milliseconds, ≦50 milliseconds, ≦25 milliseconds, ≦20 milliseconds, and even ≦15 milliseconds are contemplated and shown in the following working examples. For an exemplary rotary tablet press, the pre-compression and main compression dwell times may be determined from a known rotational speed of the rotary press and the fraction of the die revolution for which the head flat (i.e. the portion of the tool that contacts the compression roller, ramp, or cam) is held for pre-compression or compression by the compression roller, ramp, or cam. Where the compression location on the rotary press is limited to a discrete, instantaneous location (as is the case with tools impacted by compression rollers), this fraction of the die revolution is approximately equal to the tool head diameter divided by the die circle circumference. Thus, dwell time (in milliseconds) in such applications may be calculated as: [(Head Flat Diameter)/(2π×(Radius of rotary press die circle))]×[(60,000 ms/min)/(RPM)]. As one example, a 29-station rotary press with a die circle diameter of 410 mm and a head flat diameter of 15.52 mm can produce 90,000 tablets per hour using an operating speed of approximately 51.7 rpm, resulting in pre-compression and main compression dwell times of approximately 14 ms each. Because this dwell time is the rate limiting step in the operation of multi-station presses, press operation can be much faster when the inventive multi-step compaction process is used. Thus, commercially-available multi-stage tabletting presses can be operated at machine speeds capable of producing ≧50,000, ≧75,000, ≧100,000, and even ≧125,000, inventive coffee tablets per hour using the inventive processes. Because different machines may have two or more distinct production lines (two or more main compression steps), which may differ from machine to machine, it may be helpful to set forth production rates in terms of a number of tablets per set of compressions per die per hour (e.g., for the pre-compression/main compression examples, the set of compressions would include both compressions). Using the inventive processes to manufacture the inventive tablets herein, production rates of >1000 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >1500 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2000 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2400 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2500 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2750 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; and >3000 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour are possible, and even production rates of >3100 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >3450 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; and >35×00 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour are possible. Tabletting presses capable of carrying out multi-stage compaction at these compaction pressures, dwell times, and production rates are available from a number of different commercial sources including Fette®, Korsch®, and possibly Courtoy® and Manesty®. In accordance with still another feature of this invention, it has been further found that the inventive coffee tablets, because of the way they are made, achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise identical conventional ground roast coffee composition (i.e., the same untabletted ground roast coffee). That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the inventive coffee tablets are used in a typical ADC coffee maker than when the same amount of conventional (untabletted) ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. This feature is illustrated in the following working examples which show that the yield ratios provided by the inventive coffee tablets, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the inventive coffee tablets relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of untabletted (but otherwise identical) ground roast coffee, are normally >1 and in many instances >1.1, >1.15, and even >1.2 on a weight basis. Moreover, this is so even when the yield of coffee solids, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the inventive coffee tablets relative to the amount of coffee present in the coffee tablets before brewing (i.e., [grams of coffee solids extracted from the brewed coffee]/[grams of coffee placed in the brew basket to brew the coffee]×[100]), is >26%, >28.5%, or even >30%. Still another feature of this invention is that an enhanced extraction efficiency (as evidenced, for example, by increased absorbance, absorbance per gram, yield, and percent brew solids) exhibited by the inventive coffee tablets, as described herein, is essentially independent of the magnitude of the pre-compression force used in the pre-compression step of the inventive manufacturing process. This is illustrated in FIG. 1, which further shows that the brew solids (i.e., amount of coffee solids recovered in the brewed coffee product) remains essentially unaffected as the magnitude of the pre-compression force is varied. (When using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, brew solids of 0.36-1.3% or 0.5-1% or 0.42-1.5% or 0.5-0.9% or 0.50-0.75% are of interest.) Because of this feature, the hardness and friability of the inventive coffee tablets can be suitably selected, as discussed above, without compromising this enhanced brewing efficiency. Another way to determine the amount of coffee solids that are extracted during brewing is to measure the coffee brew's absorbance. The absorbance is, in effect, a measure of the darkness of a coffee brew. A spectrophotometer is used to measure the amount of light absorbance by the liquid brewed coffee at a wavelength of 480 nanometers (nm). A wavelength of 480 nm has been chosen because it corresponds with an absorption feature in the visible spectrum that is associated with the brown color of coffee brews (i.e., the Brown Color absorbance). Stronger coffee brews typically exhibit a bore prominent Brown Color absorbance. Thus, the absorbance value taken at 480 nm correlates with the visually perceived darkness of a cup of coffee. In practice, for example, a sample of brewed coffee is placed in an 8 ml sealed vial and cooled for 15 minutes at room temperature: the sample is then transferred to a cuvette and the absorbance is measured in a Genesys 10 Spectrophotometer at 480 nm wavelength. Absorbance values >1.1, >1.25, and >1.7 and <3.5, <2.5, and <1.75 are of interest. From this base measure of the brewed coffee absorbance, several other values are of interest, including: absorbance ratio (absorbance of brew from tablets/absorbance of brew of the same untabletted ground roast coffee); absorbance per gram (absorbance/grams of coffee put in brew basket) (e.g., at a 10 tablet basis); and absorbance/gram ratio: (Absorbance/gram tablets)/(Absorbance/gram of the same untabletted ground roast coffee). Absorbance ratios >1, >1.06, and >1.12 are of interest. Absorbance per gram values >0.06, >0.07, and >0.09 are of interest. Absorbance per gram ratios >1.05, >1.15, and >1.2 are of interest. Brew Dynamics In accordance with still another aspect of this invention, it has further been found that the inventive coffee tablets, which, because of the way they are made, may have a modified time dependency associated with their brew performance over the course of brewing cycle (also referred to as “brew dynamics”). For example, over the duration of a brew cycle, the instantaneous concentration of coffee solids extracted (herein referred to as “instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration”) for a particular chronological portion of the brew (for example, one or more aliquots forming an initial, a middle, or an end portion of the brew) may be altered, as compared to the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration for the same portion formed from one or more aliquots taken from a brew made using untabletted coffee in roasted and ground form. As described herein, an “instantaneous” measure of brew dynamics (e.g., instantaneous concentration, instantaneous absorbance, or instantaneous brew delivery) describes the characteristics of one of a series of incremental or sequential samples or aliquots taken contemporaneously with the brewing process, such as, for example, one of a series of 20 second timed aliquots of the brew. Thus, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration associated with an initial portion of a brew produced using the inventive coffee tablets may be lower than the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration for an initial portion of a brew produced using the corresponding untabletted coffee. The extent to which the concentration of solids will be lower may depend, for example, on the wettability of the compacted coffee tablet and the rate at which the coffee tablet is broken up during brewing. Expressed in terms of the mass of the total brew, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the mass of the initial portion is approximately 200-300 g taken from a total brew mass of 1330 g. Expressed in terms of the total brewing period, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, this initial portion is removed, approximately, during the initial 100-150 seconds of a 630 second total brew period (as timed from initial extraction). Additionally or alternatively, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration associated with a middle portion (collected in one or more aliquots) of a brew (e.g., during a period immediately following the period associated with the initial portion) produced using the inventive coffee tablets may be greater than the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration for a middle portion of a brew produced using the corresponding untabletted coffee. The extent to which the concentration of solids will be higher with the inventive coffee tablets may depend, for example, on an increased extractability be associated with or resulting from the disruption of cellular particles within the coffee tablets. Expressed in terms of the mass of the total brew, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the mass of the middle portion is approximately 200-300 g taken immediately following the initial 200-300 g associated with the initial portion, from a total brew mass of 1330 g. Expressed in terms of the total brewing period, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, this middle portion is removed, approximately, during the 80-130 seconds, immediately following the 100-150 seconds in which the initial portion is taken, of a 630 second total brew period (as timed from initial extraction). A reduced instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration exhibited in the initial aliquot, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as the amount of coffee solids extracted during the initial brew period, as a percentage of the total extracted coffee solids during the entire brew. In one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the coffee solids extracted during the first 2100 g of a 1330 g brew is approximately 5-15% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew, and may, for example, be approximately 5-11% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew (as compared to approximately 30-60% solids extraction for a corresponding roast and ground coffee). An increased instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration exhibited in the middle portion, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as the amount of coffee solids extracted during the mid-range brew period (during which the one or more aliquots taken to form the middle portion of the brew are collected), as a percentage of the total extracted coffee solids during the entire brew. In one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g-sec, the coffee solids extracted during the 250 g after the first 250 g of a 1330 g brew is approximately 35-50% of the total extracted coffee solids during the entire brew, and may, for example, be approximately 40-50% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew (as compared to approximately 20-40% solids extraction for a corresponding roast and ground coffee). In another example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the coffee solids extracted during the 200 g after the first 300 g of a 1330 g brew is approximately 33-40% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew (as compared to approximately 15-27% solids extraction for a corresponding roast and ground coffee). A reduced instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration measured during an initial brew period, followed by an increased instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration measured during a subsequent mid-range brew period, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the initial brew period divided by the total coffee solids extracted during the mid-range brew period (or vice versa). As one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the first 250 g of a 1330 g brew to the total coffee solids extracted during the next 250 g of the brew is approximately 0.3-0.65 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 2-5). As another example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the first 200 g of a 1330 g brew to the total coffee solids extracted during the 200 g after the first 300 g of the brew is approximately 0.18-0.31 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 1.4-3.5). As still another example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the first 200 g of a 1330 g brew to the total coffee solids extracted during the 250 g after the first 250 g of the brew is approximately 0.14-0.25 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 1.0-2.2). Further, the brew dynamics of the inventive tabletted coffee product may be such that after some intermediate point in the brewing process (e.g., after an initial approximately 600-850 g of a 1330 g brew) using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the cumulative mass of coffee solids extracted exceeds the cumulative mass of coffee solids extracted from brewing the same untabletted coffee in roasted and ground form at a corresponding point in its brewing process. In one such example, this intermediate point is approximately 300-360 seconds into a 630-second total brewing period. Additionally or alternatively, the inventive coffee tablets, when brewed, may result in absorbance during an initial portion of the brew that is lower than that produced during the same initial portion of a brew when brewing the corresponding untabletted coffee. A reduced absorbance during an initial brew period, followed by an increased absorbance during a subsequent mid-range brew period, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as a ratio of the absorbance of the brew during the initial brew period divided by the absorbance of the brew during the mid-range brew period (or vice versa). As one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the absorbance during the first 250 g of a 1330 g brew to the absorbance during the next 250 g of the brew is approximately 0.3-0.6 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 1.5-2.5). Instant Coffee In accordance with another aspect of this invention, it has been found that instant coffee when included in the inventive coffee tablets in small but suitable amounts acts as a binder, a disintegration aid and a brewing aid. Coffee tablets formed entirely from instant coffee have been made but such products typically do not have the desired flavor and aroma characteristics of conventional ground roast coffee. Instant coffee, however, can be mixed with ground roast coffee at low levels and tabletted in accordance with the teachings herein. The amount of instant coffee that may be included in the inventive ground roast coffee tablets in accordance with this aspect of the invention should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least one of the properties indicated above, i.e., binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, without unduly altering the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In general, this means that the amount of instant coffee included will normally be ≧˜0.5 wt. %, ≧˜1 wt. % or ≧˜3 wt. %, based on the total amount of coffee solids in the tablet (i.e., the total amount of ground roast coffee, decaffeinated ground roast coffee and instant coffee). In addition, this also means that the amount of instant coffee included will normally be ≦˜15 wt. %, more typically ≦˜10 wt. %, or ≦˜6 wt. %, ≦˜5 wt. % or even ≦˜4 wt. %, based on the total amount of coffee solids in the tablet (i.e., the total amount of ground roast coffee, decaffeinated ground roast coffee and instant coffee). Embodiments in which the inventive coffee tablets contain up to 20 wt. % or even 30 wt. % instant coffee are contemplated. The presence of instant coffee in coffee tablets can be detected by a number of different methods. The process of making instant coffee changes the composition of the coffee. One compositional change that occurs is a change in the concentration of low molecular weight carbohydrates that are present. Compounds that tend to be increased in instant coffees are monosaccharides, especially the monosaccharides mannose, arabinose, and galactose. These may be measured by a variety of methods. However, one method is described in R. M. Noyes and C. M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. These three compounds increase in instant coffee compared to roast ground coffee. Galactose is especially interesting because previous reports have indicated that galactose is not present in roast ground coffee. The other monosaccharides may be present in ground roast coffee, but it is believed that they are present at much lower levels than they are in instant coffee. These differences in the amount of low molecular weight carbohydrates present in tablets made from mixtures of roast ground coffee and instant coffee do not affect the flavor of the coffee brew produced, as long as the weight percent of instant coffee present in the tablets is kept within the ranges described herein. Interesting levels of these specific carbohydrates in certain embodiments of the coffee tablets include: galactose in an amount >0.0005 wt. %, or >0.001 wt. %, or >0.003 wt. %; galactose in an amount <0.012 wt. %, or <0.02 wt. %, or <0.03 wt. %: arabinose in an amount >0.0045 wt. %, or >0.005 wt. %, or >0.0075; arabinose in an amount <0.04 wt. %, or <0.07 wt. %, or <0.1 wt. %; mannose in an amount >0.007 wt. %, or >0.0075 wt. %, or >0.008 wt. %; and mannose in an amount <0.03 wt. %, or <0.04 wt. %, or <0.06 wt. %. These may be determined using a gas chromatograph as follows: samples are freeze dried to remove water prior to the analysis; samples are processed with dimethyl sulfoxide to solubilize the sugars and the solution is silated with tri-sil concentrate, which causes the free sugars to form a volatile complex which is analyzed by direct injection into a gas chromatograph. The percent relative standard deviation for this method has been determined to be 2.52% for mannitol and 1.49% for total free sugars. Additionally, although not tested, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee tablet to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. For example, the addition of small amounts of steam to roast ground coffee will not greatly affect the roast ground coffee appearance (perhaps it will darken). In contrast, instant coffee is known to absorb steam and may appear to liquefy and perhaps “melt.” This visual effect will likely be more pronounced if the tablets being tested are broken up before being steamed and viewed under a microscope. In addition, the visual inspection of a tablet under a microscope without steaming might permit a determination that instant coffee is present in the coffee tablet. This is because instant coffee is known to have a very different appearance than ground roast coffee. This different appearance may or may not be easy to detect with tablets formed from both ground roast coffee and instant coffee, as the tabletting process may change the size of the particles making the difference between instant coffee particles and ground roast coffee particles harder to see. Drying the Coffee Beans Before Roasting Another interesting aspect of this invention relates to controlling the size and properties of the inventive ground roast coffee tablets by low-moisture drying of the coffee beans that are used to make the ground roast coffee from which these inventive ground roast coffee tablets are subsequently made, i.e., by drying these coffee beans to a moisture content below the 12% level of conventional coffee beans prior to roasting. In particular, it is possible to reduce the friability of these tablets by a factor of as much as 2, 4, 6, 10 and even 100 by drying the coffee beans in this manner. Also, corresponding reductions in tablet volume can be achieved, which are on the order of 10%, 20% and even 30% as compared to the volume of an otherwise identical tablet made from conventionally dried coffee beans. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, coffee beans are further dried before roasting from a conventional moisture content of ˜12% to a moisture content of ≦10%, ≦8%, ≦7%, ≦6%, or even ≦5%. Thus low-moisture drying the beans to a moisture content of ˜0.5 to ˜10%, ˜2% to ˜7%, ˜2% to ˜6%, ˜3% to ˜6%, or even ˜3% to ˜5%, is contemplated. This additional drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at from 70° to 325° F. (21° to 163° C.), or ˜70° F. to ˜300° F., ˜120° F. to ˜275° F., or even ˜160° F. to ˜250° F. over drying times lasting ˜1 minute to ˜24 hours, ˜30 minutes to ˜24 hours, ˜1 hour to ˜24 hours, ˜1 hour to ˜12 hours, ˜1 hour to ˜6 hours, or even ˜2 hours to ˜6 hours. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,703 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757, which describe methods for low-moisture drying coffee beans prior to roasting. The disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. After moisture reduction in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the low-moisture beans obtained can then be roasted by any conventional technique, as discussed above. For example, the low-moisture dried beans can be charged into a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from ˜350° to ˜1200° F. (˜177° C. to ˜649° C.) preferably from ˜400° F. to ˜800° F. (˜204° C. to ˜427° C.), at roast times from ˜10 seconds to not longer than ˜5.5 minutes, preferably from ˜10 to ˜47 seconds. The low-moisture dried coffees may be used alone or in mixtures with other coffee beans, both low-moisture dried and conventionally dried. Flavorants Flavorants, both liquid and solid, can be included in the inventive coffee tablets in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Crème Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. A number of difficulties may arise when flavorants are added to coffee products. First, flavorants are normally added at a standardized level rather than at levels specifically targeted to a type of consumer. Consequently, all consumers get the same relative amount of flavor, whether or not they prefer a higher or lower flavor intensity. Second, flavorants may segregate during shipping and handling, so that the concentration of flavoring may vary through the mass of the coffee product (for example, low at the top of the canister and high at the bottom of the canister). Third, the timing associated with when the aroma of the flavorant is released during the brewing cycle is difficult to control, even though generating different aromas at different times in the brew cycle may be desirable. In accordance with another aspect of this invention, these problems are largely eliminated by including flavorants in the inventive coffee tablets. For example, since all the ingredients of the inventive coffee tablets have been compacted together, segregation of flavorants is largely eliminated. Additionally, the dry flavorant in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,185 also helps prevent segregation in the in-feed to the equipment, as described in that patent. Moreover, because the inventive coffee tablets can be formulated with different flavorants, and with different amounts of flavorants, the desired flavor and intensity of a brewed coffee can be easily customized to taste, by appropriately selecting and combining different amounts of different flavored coffee tablets to use in the brewing cycle. Moreover, since the coffee tablets can be produced with the flavorants located in different portions throughout the inventive coffee tablets (e.g., in the middle, on the surface, in between the two), the timing associated with when the aroma is released in the brew cycle can also be selected and controlled. As appreciated by coffee professionals, coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of flavor carriers that are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. Moreover, these carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. In accordance with this invention, some flavor carriers have surprisingly been found to act like binders in coffee tablets. Encapsulated flavorants such as those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,185, can also be used. The entire disclosure of this patent is incorporated herein by reference. In this regard, it has been further found, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, that by adding flavorants to the inventive coffee tablets using the solid carriers described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,185, stronger tablets which generate a greater yield of coffee solids in the brewed coffee product are obtained, as compared with tablets which do not contain flavorant. Use of a dry flavorant in formulating the inventive coffee tablets has a number of benefits. Mixing a dry flavorant with a dry coffee composition ensures that the flavor is uniformly distributed within the coffee prior to tabletting. In addition, using a dry flavor compositions allows tablets to be made in which some of the flavor can be incorporated into a separate dry layer residing on one or more surfaces, or in the middle of the tablet. It is also possible to have some of the flavor mixed in with the ground roast coffee and a second portion of the flavorant residing on the surface of the tablet or arranged in a multi-layer arrangement with other flavor layers. This not only provides an interesting visual signal to the consumer that a flavorant or flavorants are present, but it also allows for a time release characteristic associated with the release of the aroma of the flavorant to be incorporated into the tablet. For example, a first flavor layer may be placed on the outside of the tablet to release a first aroma of the first flavorant, and a second flavor layer may be placed in the inside of the tablet to release a second aroma of the second flavorant later. The first and second flavorants may have the same or different flavors and aromas. This same effect can also be achieved with flavor “bits” which can be mixed in with the coffee and/or adhered to the surface. Normally, the dry flavorants used in making the inventive coffee tablets will have a moisture content in the range of ˜1% to ˜7%, a particle density in the range of ˜0.1 g/cc to ˜0.8 g/cc, and a mean particle size distribution in the range of ˜5 microns to ˜150 microns, although dry flavorants with moisture contents, particle densities, and mean particle size distributions outside these ranges can also be used. The ratio of coffee component particle size to flavor component particle size is generally in the range of from ˜100:1 to ˜5:1. When dry flavorants are used in making the inventive coffee tablets (including wet flavorants encapsulated in dry flavor carriers), they are typically present in the amount of ˜0.5% to ˜20% of flavorant, or ˜2% to ˜15%, more preferably from ˜3% to ˜10%, ˜4% to ˜8%, on a on a dry weight basis. When liquid or paste flavorants are used in making the inventive coffee tablets, they are typically present in the amount of ˜0.5% to ˜20% of flavorant, or ˜1.5% to ˜15% or ˜2% to ˜12%, more preferably from ˜3% to ˜10%, or even ˜3% to ˜8%. Working Examples In order to more thoroughly describe this invention, the following working examples are presented. In all of the working examples below, percent brew solids was calculated using a recognized correlation between the percent brew solids of the brewed coffee product and the refractive index of the brewed coffee product, with percent brew solids being calculated as (549.209×RI)−731.575 (at a temperature basis of 20° C.). The total brew solids was then determined by multiplying the percent brew solids by the mass of brewed coffee product, and the percent yield was calculated by dividing the total extracted brew solids by the total mass of coffee placed in the brewer (multiplied by 100). In the working examples presented in co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/168,027, filed on Apr. 9, 2009 and entitled GROUND ROAST COFFEE TABLET (the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference), the calculated correlation between refractive index and percent brew solids differed from the above correlation, as percent brew solids was calculated as (560.224×RI)×746.216 (at a temperature basis of 20° C.). Additionally, the zero point measurement for refractive index was measured at 1.33200, and has since been adjusted to 1.33204. As a result, due to changes to the temperature basis (from 20° C. to 29° C.) and the zero point measurement for refractive index, the calculated percent brew solids, total brew solids, and percent yield in the earlier working examples were approximately 15% greater than the corresponding calculated values determined and presented herein. For the working examples that have been re-presented in the present application, the percent brew solids, total brew solids, and percent yield have been adjusted to correspond to the newly adopted correlations and measurements (i.e., based on percent brew solids=(549.209×RI)−731.575, and RI zero point=1.33204). Example 1 Pre-Compression Brazilian arabica coffee beans were roasted and ground. This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of 17.9, a bulk density of 0.294 g/cm 3 and a mean particle size of 885 microns. The ground roast coffee so made was formed into cylindrical tablets containing ˜2.65 gms ground roast coffee (moisture content 4.75%) and having a diameter of about 24 to 24.5 mm by means of a Fette Model 2200SE multiple station tabletting machine operating at a rate of 90,000 tablets per hour (over 3000 tablets per hour per station and a dwell time of ˜14 millisecond) under different conditions in which the compaction force in the main or primary compactions step was held constant but the compaction force in pre-compression step was varied. The hardness of the tablets so made was determined using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode, while the friability of the tablets obtained using a Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber drum by rotating 25 grams of the tablets in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these tablets that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. Multiple tablets were tested for each batch of tablets made. The tablets so formed were then brewed into brewed coffee with Mr. Coffee® Model DR13 coffee makers, having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.75 g/sec, using 10 tablets (˜26.5 gms) and 1420 ml of water for each batch of brewed coffee brewed. For comparison purposed, a control experiment was run in the same way but using 29.5 gins conventional coffee, i.e., ground roast coffee in untabletted form. The Yield was calculated based on the grams of coffee solids recovered in the in the brewed coffee (as determined by the mass and % brew solids in this brewed coffee product). Meanwhile, the Yield ratio was determined by comparing the Yield of coffee solids obtained when using inventive coffee tablets in comparison with the yield of coffee solids obtained in a control experiment in which untabletted coffee was used. The absorbance was measured by placing a sample of the brewed coffee in an 8 ml sealed vial, cooling the sample for 15 minutes at room temperature; transferring the sample to a cuvette and measuring the absorbance in a Genesys 10 Spectrophotometer at 480 nm wavelength. The absorbance per gram was calculated by dividing the absorbance by the total mass of the coffee tablets used in the brew. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 1: TABLE 1 Example 1-Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorbance Abs/gram 4.9 39.6 2.62 18 33.1 0.90 29.8 1.22 1.808 0.069 20 39.7 2.68 2.5 50.8 0.96 30.1 1.23 1.763 0.066 29.7 39.7 2.66 6.1 45.0 0.96 27.6 1.13 1.750 0.065 37.6 39.7 2.63 4.5 46.5 0.95 29.6 1.21 1.821 0.069 As can be seen from this table, increasing the force used in the pre-compression step increases the hardness and reduces the friability of the tablets obtained without adversely the yield of the coffee solids contained in the finish coffee obtained. Note, also, that the tablets with better hardness/friability profiles had densities of 0.95 g/cm 3 or greater. In addition, the ratio between the compression forces used in the pre-compression and main compression steps ranged from ˜50% to ˜95%. Finally, also note that the yield ratio was greater than 1 for each experiment in this example, thereby indicating that the amount of coffee solids extracted from a given amount of ground roast coffee is significantly greater when that coffee is formulated into coffee tablets in accordance with this invention rather than being used in a conventional (untabletted) form. Example 2 Pre-Compression Example 1 was repeated using a coffee comprising a mixture of arabica and robusta coffee beans. The ground roast coffee so made had a bulk density of 0.28 g/cm 3 prior to compaction with a mean particle size of 720 microns. The tablets had a moisture content of about 4.7%. Tablet mass was about 2.45 grains and 10 tablets were brewed. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 2: TABLE 2 Example 2-Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorb Abs/g 5 50 2.44 20.7 30 0.89 29.4 1.16 1.935 0.080 19.9 49.9 2.40 2.0 47.1 0.97 29.6 1.17 1.904 0.079 20.5 51 2.46 2.4 46.7 0.97 29.3 1.16 1.938 0.079 30.3 50.6 2.46 6.1 46.4 0.98 28.5 1.13 1.951 0.079 40.2 50.2 2.45 6.6 40.8 0.98 28.2 1.11 1.939 0.080 As can be seen from Table 2, increasing the ratio of the forces used in the pre-compression and main compression steps dramatically reduced friability, while increasing hardness. As in Example 1, the Yield Ratio for each experiment in this example also significantly exceeded 1, thereby further demonstrating that more coffee solids are extracted from the inventive tablets than are extracted from an equivalent amount of ground roast coffee in untabletted form. Note also that the best products (i.e., tablets having the highest hardnesses and lowest friabilities) had densities of 0.97 to 0.98 g/cm 3 and that the ratio of pre-compression to main compression forces ranged from ˜40% to ˜80%. Example 3 Pre-Compression Examples 1 and 2 were repeated, except that a different blend of arabica and robusta coffees was used, the ground roast coffee produced having a density of 0.33 g/cm 3 and a mean particle size of 806 microns was used. The tablets were about 3 grams in mass with a moisture content of about 5.2%. For brewing, 29.9 to 30.5 grams of tablets were used while 33.32 grams of ground roast coffee was used in the control experiment. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 3: TABLE 3 Example 3-Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorb Abs/g 0.4 40 2.96 12.7 41.8 0.91 31.1 1.22 2.109 0.071 5.4 40.3 3.05 12.2 43.1 0.93 32.7 1.29 2.108 0.070 20.3 40.3 3.05 4.2 54.9 0.96 32.0 1.26 2.223 0.073 30.2 40.9 2.99 4.9 57 0.95 28.7 1.13 2.135 0.071 38.1 40.7 3.00 5.8 58.8 0.97 28.6 1.12 2.200 0.073 As can be seen from Table 3, a large drop in friability was observed when the ratio of the force used in the pre-compression step to the main compression step increased to ˜0.14:1 (14%) or more. The densities of these low friability products exceeded 0.95 g/cm 3 , even though the yield ratio was maintained well above 1. Example 4 Pre-Compression Example 3 was repeated using a higher force for the main compression step. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 4: TABLE 4 Example 4-Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorb Abs/g 5.4 50.6 2.98 17.4 45.1 0.96 30.1 1.18 2.273 0.076 19.9 50.8 2.99 4.2 56.1 0.98 30.2 1.18 2.214 0.074 29.8 50.5 3.02 3.6 59.6 0.99 28.6 1.12 2.174 0.072 40.8 50.1 2.99 8.3 63.0 1.01 32.1 1.26 2.184 0.073 Again, a dramatic drop in friability and an increase in hardness was observed. In this case, all products had densities greater than 0.96, without adversely affecting yield, while the ratio of pre-compression to main compression forces ranged from ˜37% to ˜82% in the tablets exhibiting good friability. It should be noted that going to higher final compression alone did not yield an improved friability, hardness, or yield. Example 5 Addition of Instant Coffee Coffee A was prepared from a mixture of ground roast arabica and robusta coffees. Coffee B was prepared by forming a blend comprising 95.2 wt. % of Coffee A and 4.8 wt. % of commercially-available Folgers® brand instant coffee. Coffees A and B were each made into tablets weighing about 3 grams each using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using seven different operating conditions. These conditions were some combination of changes in operating speed (rpm), pre-compression force, and/or main compression force. After compression, 10 tablets were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. After brewing, the percent of solids extracted into the brew was measured by refractive index, which was then converted into total solids extracted. The yield of the roast and ground (“R&G”) coffee was calculated based on amount of solids extracted divided by weight of coffee put into the brewer. The yield of coffee solids extracted from the ground roast coffee portions of the respective “Coffee B's” was determined by assuming 100% extraction of the instant coffee and subtracting the mass of the instant coffee from the total solids extracted. The following results were obtained: TABLE 5 Example 5-Test Conditions and Results Tablet % Solids R&G Tablet Tablet Volume at Mass, Brew in Brew, extracted, R&G Vol. same Brew Solids Coffee Run g Solids g g Yield cm 3 cm 3 A 1 3.17 0.65 8.58 8.58 0.27 3.17 3.17 B 1 3.08 0.82 10.72 9.24 0.32 3.11 2.47 A 2 3.05 0.62 8.13 8.13 0.27 3.09 3.09 B 2 2.98 0.80 10.59 9.16 0.32 2.98 2.32 A 3 3.06 0.64 8.46 8.46 0.28 3.18 3.18 B 3 3.07 0.82 10.84 9.37 0.32 3.16 2.48 A 4 2.98 0.60 7.89 7.89 0.26 3.06 3.06 B 4 3.0 0.71 9.40 7.96 0.28 3.05 2.58 A 5 3.0 0.60 7.96 7.96 0.27 3.03 3.03 B 5 3.01 0.71 9.40 7.96 0.28 2.95 2.57 A 6 2.9 0.55 7.33 7.33 0.25 3.01 3.01 B 6 3.0 0.93 12.23 10.79 0.38 3.1 1.85 A 7 2.94 0.76 10.09 10.09 0.34 2.93 2.93 B 7 3.04 0.79 10.40 8.94 0.31 3.01 2.92 Mean 3.01 0.63 8.35 8.35 0.28 3.06 3.06 of A Mean 3.03 0.80 10.51 9.06 0.32 3.05 2.42 of B Ratio 1.26 1.14 0.79 In the table above, the conversion from % Brew Solids to Solids in Brew was based on an assumption that 1320 ml of liquid brew was obtained for all products. This is a reasonable value for what one would expect to come out of a brew basket based on using 1420 mls of water going into the brew. (This is different from what was done in examples 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 where the actual amount of liquid brew was measured and used.) As can be seen, the addition of the instant coffee not only gave higher overall brew solids, but also increased the yield of the coffee solids extracted from the ground roast (R&G) coffee used. That is to say, more coffee solids was extracted from a given amount of ground roast coffee when instant coffee was also included in the inventive coffee tablets as compared to essentially identical coffee tablets not containing instant coffee. The last column on the right of Table 1 shows a calculated tablet size that would be obtained if the tablets made from Coffee B were resized to give the same overall extraction yield as the tablets made from Coffee A. As can be seen, the resized tablets made from Coffee B would be 20% smaller than the tablets made only from Coffee A. Example 6 Addition of Instant Coffee Additional data was collected from the same runs disclosed above in Example 5. This additional data is shown in Table 6 below as well as attached FIG. 2 in which the labels for each data point gives the fill volume for the die. TABLE 6 Example 6-Test Conditions and Results Coffee Run RPM Fill Volume Tablet Mass Fill Density A 1 17.47 9.12 3.17 0.348 B 1 17.24 8.23 3.08 0.374 A 2 17.47 9.12 3.05 0.334 B 2 17.24 8.23 3.0 0.365 A 3 34.48 9.12 3.06 0.336 B 3 34.48 8.45 3.07 0.363 A 4 34.48 9.12 2.98 0.327 B 4 34.48 8.45 2.99 0.354 A 5 34.48 9.12 3.00 0.329 B 5 34.48 8.45 3.01 0.356 A 6 51.72 9.565 2.90 0.303 B 6 50.63 9.12 3.00 0.329 A 7 51.72 9.565 2.94 0.307 B 7 50.63 9.12 3.04 0.333 Mean of A 9.247 3.014 0.326 Mean of B 8.579 3.027 0.353 Ratio 0.928 1.004 1.083 From Table 6 and FIG. 2, it can be seen that the fill volume for Coffee B was less than the fill volume for Coffee A for each run. Note, also, that the mass of Coffee A decreased, while that of Coffee B remained fairly constant. In addition, although the fill volume for Coffee A increased, it was always larger than the fill volume for Coffee B. Comparing especially the highest machine speed, the fill volume for Coffee B was 5% less than for Coffee A, yet the tablet mass was 4% higher. This shows that including instant coffee in the inventive ground roast coffee tablets allows a more efficient fill of the individual dies, and hence higher operating speeds of the machine, before machine capacity is limited by die filling. This effect, coupled with the lower mass made possible by including instant coffee, as described in Example 5, enables even higher machine operating speeds to be obtained. The operating speed of tabletting machines should not be increased so high that tablet mass decreases appreciably or varies unacceptably for a given ground roast coffee. If tablets are underweight relative to other tablets made from the same ground roast coffee, a consumer may be dissatisfied because brewing the tablets will result in too weak of a brew. Additionally, if the tablet mass varies too much for a given ground roast coffee, a consumer may be discouraged from using the tablets because the resulting brew differs too much from use to use. Example 7 Low-Moisture Drying of Coffee Beans Coffee A was made by roasting Mexican arabica coffee beans in a Neuhaus Neotec roaster for 3.3 minutes to an L-color of 12.2. Coffee B was made from the same Mexican arabica coffee beans, which were low-moisture dried to a moisture content of 5 wt. % before roasting, and then roasted in a Neuhaus Neotec roaster for 2.3 minutes to an L-color of 12.6. Both coffees were ground roast to a similar mean particle size (˜760 microns), with Coffee A exhibiting a moisture content of 4.9% and a density of 0.27 g/cm 3 while Coffee B exhibited a moisture content of 5.0% and a density of 0.22 g/cm 3 . Both coffees were then made into tablets having a nominal diameter of 23.8 mm using a Fette Model 2200 rotary tablet press operating at a pre-compression force of 35 kN, a main compression force of 40 kN and an operating speed of 17.2 rpm. The mass of the ground roast coffee fed to the machine was varied such that tablets made from Coffee A averaged 2.8 grams while those from coffee B averaged 2.0 grams. Tablet A had an average volume of 2.9 cm 3 while tablet B had an average volume of 2.0 cm 3 , a 30% reduction in volume. Friability was measured and was found to be 0.95% for Coffee A and 0.06% for Coffee B, which represents a reduction of over 90%, or by a factor of over 15. After production, tablets were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) automatic drip coffeemaker. Brewing was conducted with 10 cups of water. Total coffee used was 30.9 g for coffee A and 30.6 g for coffee B. After brewing the % brew solids in the brewed coffee made from coffee A was found to be 0.66 wt. %, while the % brew solids for the brewed coffee made from coffee B was found to be 0.64 wt. %. In addition, the yield for coffee A was found to be 28.4%, while the yield for coffee B was found to be 27.7%, even though coffee tablets B were ˜30% smaller. As can be seen from this experiment, although much smaller tablets were made in the case of Coffee B, the extraction of coffee solids from Coffee B was essentially the same as that for Coffee A. Moreover, the friability of the tablets made from Coffee B was lower than the friability of the tablets made from Coffee A. Example 8 Low-Moisture Drying of Coffee Beans Example 7 was repeated using different machine operating conditions for making the tablets. Table 7 compares the results obtained using low-moisture dried coffee beans and non-low-moisture dried (conventionally dried) coffee beans.

Example 9 Low-Moisture Drying of Coffee Beans A regular roast, ground roast coffee was made using 55% arabica coffee beans and 45% robusta coffee beans. On average, the coffee beans were roasted to a Hunter L color of about 15.7 L over a roast period of about 3.2 minutes. All coffees were treated by typical processing to provide ground roast coffees have a typical particle size of approximately 825 microns and a typical density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 . A ground roast coffee was made from 10% regular ground roast arabica coffee, 40% regular ground roast robusta coffee, and 50% ground roast arabica coffee derived from coffee beans that had been low-moisture dried to a moisture content of about 5% to produce a ground roast coffee mixture comprising 60% arabica and 40% robusta coffees, the coffee mixture having a mean particle size of ˜635 microns and a density of ˜0.247 g/cm 3 . The roasted, ground roast coffees so made were formed into tablets in a similar manner to that of the above Examples 7 and 8 using various different operating conditions. The tablets so obtained were then used to brew brewed coffees in the same manner as described above in connection with Examples 7 and 8.

In addition, a 9% reduction in tablet volume was also achieved relative to tablets made with the conventionally dried coffee beans. Roast and ground coffee from pre-dried green coffee that has not been quickly roasted to a dark enough color does not appear to provide improved friability (i.e., does not provide decreased friability) relative to non-pre-dried green coffee. For example, pre-dried coffee roasted to 18.8 L and then ground and tabletted did not show an improved friability vis-à-vis normal moisture beans or vis-à-vis a 50/50 mix of pre-dry and normal moisture green coffee. Example 10 Liquid Flavor Carrier Additional coffee tablets were made using the inventive multi-step compaction process in general accordance with Examples 1-4 in which the magnitude of the initial compression step as well as the speed of the press, as measured by dwell time in the main compression step were varied. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 15 (runs b and d are from Example 3): TABLE 15 Example 10-Set 1 - Test Conditions and Results Dwell Initial Final Hard- Fria- Time, Compression, Compression, ness, bility, Run Ktab/hr msec kN kN N % a 60 21.0 20.5 40.7 60.5 2.3 b 90 14.0 20.3 40.3 54.9 4.2 c 120 10.5 20 40.2 43.0 9.1 d 90 14.0 0.4 40 41.8 12.7 By comparing Runs b and d, which were carried out at the same production rate (90,000 tablets/hr with a dwell time of 14.0 milliseconds), it can be seen that (as in the case of Examples 1-4) the both hardness and friability are improved when the force encountered in the initial compression step was more than about 20% of the force encountered in the main or primary compression step in accordance with this invention. It will also be noted, however, that as the production rate of the inventive tablets increased (runs a through c), hardness and friability declined somewhat (although both were still better than the control, Run d). Another set of experiments similar to Set 1 above was run using a different coffee. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 16: TABLE 16 Example 10-Set 2-Test Conditions and Results Dwell Initial Final Hard- Fria- Time, Compression, Compression, ness, bility, Run Ktab/hr msec kN kN N % e 90 14.0 30.7 49.6 56.3 4.7 f 120 10.5 29.9 49.2 43.4 9.0 g 130 9.7 30.8 49.8 42.1 11.8 Again, these results show the same trend as in the above Set 1, i.e., that as the production rate of the inventive tablets increased, hardness and friability declined somewhat. Still another set of experiments similar to Sets 1 and 2 above was run using the same coffee and conditions of Set 2, except that the inventive tablets contained 3 wt. % of a liquid flavor carrier comprising propylene glycol and triacetin. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 17: TABLE 17 Example 10-Set 3-Test Conditions and Results Dwell Initial Final Hard- Fria- Time, Compression, Compression, ness, bility, Run Ktab/hr msec kN kN N % h 90 14.0 30.7 49.5 79.2 0.9 i 120 10.5 29.2 49.4 71.8 1.5 j 130 9.7 29.2 50.3 74.5 2.1 These results show the same trend as in the above Sets 1 and 2, i.e., that as the production rate of the inventive tablets increased, hardness and friability declined somewhat. However, Table 17 shows that the magnitude of this effect is greatly reduced due to the presence of the liquid flavor carrier. Example 11 Liquid Flavor Carrier Brazilian coffee beans were roasted and ground. This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of 16.8 a bulk density of 0.31 g/cm 3 and a mean particle size of 890 microns. The roasted and ground coffee was separated into three batches. One batch was mixed with 3 wt. % propylene glycol (PG), based on the total weight of the composition obtained. A second batch was mixed 3 wt. % of a 90/10 w/w mixture of propylene glycol and triacetin (PG/TriA). No flavor carrier was added to the third batch, although it was mixed in a similar manner to the other batches. All mixing was done using a Forberg mixer. Each of the three batches were made into tablets using a Fette 2200 SE tabletting press at a variety of conditions. Hardness was measured immediately after production and again at least 6 days after production. Friability was measured at least 6 days after production. All tablets were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. Approximately 26 grams of tablets were brewed for each product. The % brew solids and the yield of coffee solids obtained in the final product were also determined. Nine different runs were made at different operating conditions, each run comparing the three different batches of tablets as described above. Table 18 below shows the mean values obtained for the hardness, friability, and brew yields obtained for each of these experiments. TABLE 18 Example 11-Set 1-Results Obtained % Initial Final Hardness % Brew % Coffee Hardness, N Hardness, N Change, N Friability Solids Yield Absorbance Control 54.8 47.8 −7.0 7.8 0.72 35.1 1.88 Control + 77.6 79.8 2.2 1.1 0.8 39.2 2.1 propylene glycol Control 56.4 49.7 −6.7 6.3 0.73 35.3 1.88 Control + 69.8 71.5 1.7 1.9 0.78 37.8 2.15 liquid mixture As can be seen from Table 18, the addition of the liquid carrier gave increased hardness and lower friability without impairing brewing performance. Moreover, addition of the liquid carrier also prevented the tablets from experiencing the same small yet still significant decrease in hardness within their first week of manufacture shown by the Control tablets. Additionally, the liquid flavor carriers appear to be so effective that use of such liquid flavor carriers can make very low pre-compression forces viable at a high rate of manufacture (and perhaps will make no pre-compression tablets viable at high rates of manufacture). The following Table 19 shows examples of products made with low initial compression. They are not as good as tablets made with a higher initial compression; however, they may be commercially acceptable.

The flavor compound was intended to be used at a nominal 3% level (as discussed above in connection with the discussion of flavor carriers and flavorants). The coffee was turned into tablets in accordance with this invention using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press. Compression conditions used were pre-compression of 22 kN and a main compression of 35 kN in a rotary press having 29 stations with round dies of nominally 23.8 mm in diameter and operating at a speed of 25.9 rpm, thereby producing 45,000 tablets per hour (about 1550 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; the other values herein for tablets per hour using the Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press can be converted to tablets per set of compressions per die per hour by dividing the hourly rate by 29 (there are 29 stations in the press used). In the case of rpm, the tablets per set of compressions per die per hour may be obtained by multiplying the rpm by 60 minutes per hour). The tablets obtained had an average mass of 2.87 grams, an average hardness of 112 N and an average friability of 0.26%. After production, the tablets were filled into metalized tin cans. Another set of cans was filled with a control sample composed of the roast ground coffee from which the tablets were made in untabletted form. Cans were sealed and stored at 70° F. After two weeks, these products were evaluated for the concentration of certain volatiles in the outgas obtained from these products at the time they were removed from their respective cans. In particular, for the control sample of conventional ground roast coffee, a coffee sample was removed from the can and placed in a closed container. In the case of the inventive coffee tablets, the tablets were gently broken apart to a particle size roughly equivalent to that of the conventional ground roast coffee of the control sample, and placed in a closed container. The outgas from the closed container of the conventional ground roast coffee and the broken apart tablets were analyzed. The concentrations of 25 different compounds were measured by gas chromatography, some representing the coffee volatiles recovered from the ground roast coffee in both examples and others representing the French Vanilla flavorant. The data obtained was normalized to enable a direct comparison of the concentrations of these ingredients in their respective outgases to one another. The results obtained are provided in FIG. 3. As can be seen from this figure, the coffee volatiles outgassed from both samples, i.e., the conventional (untabletted) coffee and the inventive coffee tablets, are essentially the same. Approximately 15 months after the samples mentioned above were analyzed, additional samples were taken from previously unopened cans of both the inventive coffee tablets and the conventional (untabletted) coffee. The above tests were repeated, and the results obtained reported in FIG. 4. As can be seen from this figure, essentially the same results were obtained.

The first set of tabletted product used roasted and ground Brazilian coffee beans, with a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜4.293 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜874 microns, and a moisture content of ˜3.2%. The first set of roasted and ground coffee was separated into five batches. Four of the batches were mixed with propylene glycol (“LFC”) at levels of 0.5 wt. %, 1.0 wt. %, 3.5 wt. %, and 6.0 wt. %, respectively. The fifth batch included no added liquid flavor carrier, but was mixed in a similar manner to the other batches. All mixing was done using a Forberg mixer. Each of the five batches were made into tablets using a Fette 2200 SE tabletting press at a variety of pre-compression and main compression forces. All tablets were produced at a rate of 90,000 tablets per hour. Hardness was measured immediately after production and again at least 6 days after production. Friability was measured at least 6 days after production. The results of these measurements are listed below in Table 21.

The roasted and ground coffee was separated into three batches. One batch was mixed with ˜3 wt. % propylene glycol (PG), based on the total weight of the composition obtained. A second batch was mixed with ˜3 wt. % of a 90/10 w/w mixture of propylene glycol and triacetin (PG/TriA). No flavor carrier was added to the third batch, although it was mixed in a similar manner to the other batches. All mixing was done using a Forberg mixer. Each of the three batches were made into tablets using a Fette 2200 SE tabletting press at a variety of pre-compression and main compression forces. All tablets were produced at a rate of 90,000 tablets per hour. Hardness was measured immediately after production and again at least 6 days after production. Friability was measured at least 6 days after production. The results of these measurements are listed below in Table 22. The minimal improvements in hardness and friability that accompanied the increases in liquid flavor concentration, as compared to the significant improvements observed in the test results of Example 10 and Example 13, set 1, suggest these results may be bad data, although this has not been confirmed.

Tablets were formed using varying pre-compression and final or main compression, and the hardness and friability of each tablet was calculated in a manner consistent with that described in Example 1. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 23: TABLE 23 Example 14--Results Obtained Dwell Initial Final Tablet Hard- Fria- Ktab/ Time, Compression, Compression, Density, ness, bility, hr msec kN kN g/cm 3 N % 82 15.3 0.5 9 0.640 7.4 81.7 82 15.3 0.5 20.7 0.817 26.5 13.7 82 15.3 0.4 25.2 0.859 29.5 10.4 82 15.3 0.6 41 0.894 22.8 16.9 82 15.3 10.3 24.8 0.871 35.8 8.5 82 15.3 5 39 0.878 21.9 23.3 As shown, in tablets formed using very low pre-compression (less than 1 kN), initial increases in final or main compression (from 9 kN to 25.2 kN) improve hardness and friability, while further increases in main compression (from 25.2 kN to 41 kN) actually diminish hardness and friability (i.e., decrease hardness and increase friability), even though the density of the tablet has increased. Further, a tablet with a lower main compression (24.8 kN) but higher pre-compression (10.3 kN) may provide improved hardness and friability as compared to a tabled formed with a higher main compression (39 kN) and a lower pre-compression (5 kN). Example 15 Pre-Compression Brazilian coffee beans were roasted and ground. This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8%. The ground roast coffee so made was formed into cylindrical tablets containing ˜2.6-2.7 g ground roast coffee and having a diameter of about 24 to 24.5 mm by means of a Fette Model 2200SE multiple station tabletting machine operating at rates of 70,000 and 90,000 tablets per hour under different conditions in which the compaction forces in the pre-compression and main or primary compaction steps were varied. The hardness and friability of the tablets were tested in a manner consistent with the tablets of Example 1. The tablets so formed were then brewed in a manner consistent with the tablets of Example 1. The Yield was calculated based on the grams of coffee solids recovered in the brewed coffee (as determined by the mass and % brew solids in this brewed coffee product). Meanwhile, the Yield ratio was determined by comparing the Yield of coffee solids obtained when using inventive coffee tablets in comparison with the yield of coffee solids obtained in a control experiment in which untabletted coffee was used.

This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of about 17-18, a bulk density of ˜0.288 g/cm 3 a mean particle size of about 700-800 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.43%. The ground roast coffee so made was formed into cylindrical tablets containing ˜2.66 gins ground roast coffee and having a diameter of about 24 to 24.5 mm by means of a Fette Model 2200SE multiple station tabletting machine operating at rates of 70,000 and 80,000 tablets per hour under different conditions in which the compaction forces in the pre-compression and main or primary compaction steps were varied. The hardness of the tablets so made was determined using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode, while the friability of the tablets obtained using a Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber drum by rotating 25 grams of the tablets in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these tablets that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. Multiple tablets were tested for each batch of tablets made. The tablets so formed were then brewed into brewed coffee with Mr. Coffee® Model DR13 coffee makers, using 10 tablets (˜26.5 gms) and 1420 ml of water for each batch of brewed coffee brewed. For comparison purposes, a control experiment was run in the same way but using 26.5 gins conventional coffee, i.e. ground roast coffee in untabletted form. The Yield was calculated based on the grams of coffee solids recovered in the brewed coffee (as determined by the mass and percent brew solids in this brewed coffee product). Meanwhile, the Yield ratio was determined by comparing the Yield of coffee solids obtained when using inventive coffee tablets in comparison with the yield of coffee solids obtained in a control experiment in which untabletted coffee was used.

Coffee 17B was prepared from coffee beans including a mixture of arabicas, dried arabicas, and robustas, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18, a bulk density of ˜0.3125 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜760 microns, and a moisture content of ˜5.25%. Coffee 17C was prepared from decaffeinated coffee beans, roasted and ground to a bulk density of ˜0.323 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜782 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.79%. Coffee 17D was prepared from coffee beans including a mixture of washed arabicas, naturals, and robustas having a Hunter L-color of ˜15.4, a bulk density of ˜0.285 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜710 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.89%. Coffee 17E was prepared from 10% regular ground roast arabica coffee, 40% regular ground roast robusta coffee, and 50% ground roast arabica coffee derived from coffee beans that had been low-moisture dried to a moisture content of about 5% to produce a ground roast coffee mixture comprising 60% arabica and 40% robusta coffees, the coffee mixture having a Hunter L color of ˜15.7, a mean particle size of ˜0.635 microns, a density of ˜0.247 g/cm 3 and a moisture content of ˜4.46%. Coffees 17A, 17B, 17C, 17D, and 17E were each made into tablets weighing about 2.66 grams each (ranging from about 2.62 g to about 2.70 g) using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using several different operating conditions. These conditions were some combination of changes in operating speed (rpm) and resulting compression dwell time, pre-compression force, and/or main compression force. Samples of the tablets from each run were tested for hardness and friability, with average values calculated for each of these properties. After compression, 10 tablets from each run were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. After brewing, the percent of solids extracted into the brew was measured by refractive index, which was then converted into total solids extracted. As shown in Table 26 below, tablets having very high hardnesses (i.e., >90 N) were able to be produced without the aid of binders.

Coffee 18B was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8%. Coffees 18A and 18B were then each made into tablets weighing about 3 grams each using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using several different operating conditions. These conditions were some combination of changes in operating speed (rpm) (and resulting compression dwell time), pre-compression force, and/or main compression force. Samples of the tablets from each run were initially tested for hardness and density, with average values calculated for each of these properties. At least 6 days after production, additional samples of each run were tested for hardness, density, and friability, with average values calculated for each of these properties. These results were arranged by final density for each coffee, as shown in Table 27 below. As shown in Table 27, tablets having similar densities exhibited widely varying friabilities and hardnesses.

Tablets were made using the operating conditions identified in Table 28 below. Coffee 19B was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm − , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8%, and was made into tablets in a single run (G), the tablets weighing about 2.65 grams each, using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using the operating conditions identified in Table 28 below. Samples of the tablets from each run were tested for hardness and friability, with average values for each of these properties shown in Table 28. Additionally, tablets of a competitive tabletted coffee product (H) were collected for testing, as identified in Table 28 below. After compression, 10 tablets from each run (totaling approximately 26.5 g), equivalent amounts of the corresponding roasted and ground coffee, and 4 tablets (totaling approximately 28.7 g) of the competitive tabletted coffee product, were brewed with approximately 1420 g water in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.75 g/sec. To measure instantaneous brew characteristics at increments throughout the brew (or “brew dynamics”), the brew was collected at 20 second increments in separate, small containers. For each 20 second accumulation or sample of brew, mass, refractive index, and absorbance were measured, and amount of brew solids and yield were determined from the measured refractive index (as explained in greater detail above). The samples were then incrementally and chronologically combined to measure and calculate cumulative mass, refractive index, brew solids, and yield.

As shown, the roast and ground coffees and the competitive coffee tablets exhibit higher instantaneous concentrations in an initial portion of the brews (i.e., the first 200-300) g of brew), while the inventive tabletted coffees exhibit higher instantaneous concentrations than their roast and ground counterparts and the competitive tabletted coffee subsequent to these initial portions, most substantially so in a mid-range portion of the brews (i.e., the 200-300 g of brew immediately following the initial 200-300 g of brew). FIG. 6 graphically illustrates the average cumulative extracted coffee solids over the course of the brew for the low pre-compression tablets (A and B) of Coffee 19A, the high pre-compression tablets (C, D, E, and F) of Coffee 19A, Coffee 19A in roast and ground form, and the competitor tablet H. As shown, the tabletted coffees exhibited an initial lag in extraction, as compared to their roast and ground coffee counterparts, while exceeding the extraction of the roast and ground coffees after an intermediate point in the brew (i.e., about 550-850 g into the brew). FIGS. 7 and 8 graphically illustrate the instantaneous coffee solids concentration and cumulative extracted coffee solids over the course of the brew for Coffee 19B in tabletted and roast and ground form, again showing higher initial instantaneous concentrations of coffee solids for the roast and ground coffee, and higher mid-range instantaneous concentrations of coffee solids for the tabletted coffee, as well as an initial lag in extraction for the tabletted coffee, as compared to the roast and ground coffee counterpart, with the tabletted coffee exceeding the extraction of the roast and ground coffees after an intermediate point in the brew (i.e., about 550-850 g into the brew). FIGS. 9 and 10 graphically show similar results in separately comparing five different runs of tablets produced from Coffee 19A as compared to their corresponding roast and ground coffee counterpart. As an alternative measure of the initial and mid-range brew characteristics, 10 tablets from each run (totaling approximately 26.5 g), equivalent amounts of the corresponding roasted and ground coffee, and 4 tablets (totaling approximately 28.1 g) of the competitive tabletted coffee product, were again brewed with approximately 1420 g water in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. An initial approximately 250 g portion of each brew was collected and a subsequent 250 g (“mid-range”) portion immediately following the initial portion was collected. For each of the initial and mid-range portions, refractive index and absorbance were measured, and amount of brew solids and yield were determined from the measured refractive index (as explained in greater detail above). The samples were then combined with the remainder of each total brew to measure and calculate mass, refractive index, brew solids, and yield for each total brew. As evident in Table 29 below, coffee brewed from the inventive coffee tablets produced with higher pre-compression force (i.e., greater than 30% of the main compression force) exhibited the lowest initial brew solids and absorbances and the highest mid-range brew solids and absorbances. Coffee brewed from the roasted and ground coffee samples exhibited the highest initial brew solids and absorbances and the lowest mid-range brew solids and absorbances. Coffee brewed from the inventive coffee tablets produced with lower pre-compression forces (8-10% of the main compression force) exhibited higher initial brew solids and absorbances and lower mid-range brew solids and absorbances that the coffee brewed from the higher pre-compression tablets. Coffee brewed from the competitive coffee tablets exhibited higher initial brew solids and absorbances and lower mid-range brew solids and absorbances that the coffee brewed from the lower pre-compression tablets.

Coffee 20D was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜17.9, a bulk density of ˜0.294 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜885 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.7%. Coffee 20E was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜16.8, a bulk density of ˜0.311 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜890 microns, and a moisture content of ˜5.1%. Coffee 20F was prepared from coffee beans including a mixture of arabicas, dried coffees, and robustas, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜15, a bulk density of ˜0.28 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜720 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.6%. Coffee 20G was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8% Coffee 20H was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.305 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜5%. Coffee 20I was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8%. Coffee 20J was prepared from coffee beans including a mixture of dried and regular Brazilian coffees, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.329 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.6%. Coffee 20K was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.316 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜868 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.6%. Each coffee was made into tablets in several runs, using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process. The production runs used varying tablet masses, production rates/dwell times, and pre-compression and main compression forces. For a number of production runs, relatively high production rates (or low compression dwell times) were used. For production rates of 90,000 to 120,000 tabs per hour (9.7 ms-14 ms compression dwell time), tablets having relatively high hardness (greater than 40 N) and relatively low friability (less than 10) were produced, as shown in Table 30 below. After compression, 10 tablets from each run (totaling approximately 26-27 g) were brewed with approximately 1420 g water in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. After brewing, the absorbance of the brew was measured, as described above, and the percent of solids extracted into the brew was measured by refractive index, which was then converted into total solids extracted and yield. coffee dwell Pre Main pre/ Tablet Refr Brew abs/ Br Yield abs name Run mass ktab/hr time Comp Comp main Hard Fri density Index Solid Yield % Abs. gram index Index index 20A 19 2.70 120 10.5 20.6 41 0.50 52.5 2.6 1.029 1.33326 0.603 28.5 2.071 0.077 1.10 1.06 20A 18 2.64 120 10.5 20.5 31 0.66 46.9 6.1 0.976 1.33322 0.583 28.4 2.122 0.081 1.10 1.09 20A 20 2.68 120 10.5 30.8 40.2 0.77 52.6 7.6 1.034 1.33329 0.616 29.5 2.142 0.079 1.14 1.10 20B 4 2.97 90 14.0 40.8 50.1 0.81 63.0 8.3 1.011 1.33355 0.740 32.1 2.184 0.073 1.26 1.12 20B 16 3.03 120 10.5 30.2 40 0.76 50.8 8.6 0.952 1.33343 0.683 29.6 2.242 0.075 1.16 1.15 20B 17 3.00 120 10.5 30.1 45.5 0.66 54.1 7.1 0.968 1.33344 0.689 29.4 2.252 0.074 1.15 1.16 20B 2 2.96 90 14.0 19.9 50.8 0.39 56.1 4.2 0.979 1.33347 0.702 30.1 2.214 0.074 1.18 1.14 20C 5 2.66 90 14.0 40.0 55.8 0.72 56.1 5.7 0.990 1.33325 0.598 28.6 2.059 0.077 1.12 1.10 20C 2 2.64 90 14.0 20.1 50.9 0.39 55.5 2.6 0.977 1.33328 0.612 29.3 1.991 0.074 1.15 1.06 20D 16 2.62 130 9.7 26.5 46 0.58 41.5 8.1 0.953 1.33327 0.607 29.7 1.906 0.072 1.22 1.17 20E 4 2.67 90 14 30.7 49.6 0.62 56.3 4.7 0.993 1.33329 0.616 29.9 1.838 0.069 1.23 1.09 20E 1 2.65 90 14 29.9 40.4 0.74 52.7 4.2 0.983 1.33323 0.588 28.4 1.948 0.073 1.17 1.16 20F 1 2.45 90 14 40.2 50.2 0.8 40.8 6.6 0.984 1.3331 0.526 28.2 1.939 0.080 1.11 1.17 20F 8 2.40 90 14 19.9 49.9 0.4 47.1 2.0 0.973 1.33316 0.555 29.5 1.904 0.079 1.17 1.15 20G 17 2.65 90 13.9 20.2 34.8 0.6 55.0 0.7 0.918 1.33309 0.570 27.6 1.546 0.058 1.19 1.191 1.218 20G 19 2.68 90 13.9 45.1 51.4 0.9 53.5 2.7 0.957 1.33308 0.565 27.6 1.580 0.060 1.18 1.193 1.245 20H 4 2.65 90 13.9 24.9 35.4 0.7 51.6 3.1 0.922 1.33300 0.521 25.7 1.553 0.060 1.08 1.099 1.241 20H 7 2.59 100 12.7 29.6 40.8 0.7 43.7 4.7 0.923 1.33304 0.543 26.5 1.530 0.057 1.13 1.132 1.223 20G 18 2.67 90 13.9 20.4 44.2 0.5 54.3 1.5 0.932 1.33306 0.554 26.5 1.545 0.058 1.15 1.146 1.217 20I 1 2.65 90 14.2 20.3 40.2 0.5 51.4 1.2 1.33307 0.559 27.6 1.571 0.060 1.13 1.143 1.205 20J 6 2.67 90 13.9 25.4 35 0.7 45.1 3.6 1.33306 0.554 26.7 1.469 0.055 1.20 1.178 1.313 20K 7 2.65 90 13.9 24.5 35.2 0.7 53.8 1.9 1.33305 0.548 26.8 1.634 0.062 1.11 1.121 1.347 Although only a few embodiments of this invention have been described above, it should be appreciated that many modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

BACKGROUND Automatic Drip Coffee makers (“ADCs”) are designed for processing “ground roast coffee” or “coffee,” i.e., granulated coffee obtained by grinding previously roasted coffee beans. Because of differences in flavor strength among different coffees, as well as variations in personal taste, consumers may find it difficult to determine the correct dose (amount) of coffee to use for brewing pots of different sizes. To deal with this problem, a number of products have been introduced in which the coffee is provided in standardized doses. For example, filter packs in which a predetermined amount of coffee, e.g., enough coffee to brew 4, 10 or 12 servings of brewed coffee, is provided in a filter paper container. However, this approach cannot be used for brewing one, or only a few, servings of coffee, as the consumer is required to make the amount of servings for which the filter pack is designed. In addition, it is difficult to change the strength of the brewed coffee. In an alternate approach, single serving “pods” have been provided in which enough ground roast coffee for brewing only a single serving is housed in a filter paper container. However, single serving pods must have a specific configuration to fit brewer(s) for which they are designed. Machines used to brew coffee with these pods are fundamentally different from automatic drip coffee makers. They are also limited to making a single cup at a time, which limits their usefulness in making larger amounts of brewed coffee. A further approach combines the idea of a single cup brew is found in products such as Folgers® coffee singles. These can be made with mixtures of instant and ground roast coffee. While they do not have to fit a particular brewer, they still are designed for only a single cup of coffee. In still another approach, separate “tablets” are provided which are made solely out of instant coffee (also referred to as soluble coffee). However, instant coffee is not preferred by some consumers. SUMMARY In accordance with this invention, coffee tablets for use in a conventional automatic drip coffee maker are provided. A first exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which at least a first compression and a separate second compression are carried out in the same compaction die in such a manner that the coffee tablet obtained exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an automatic drip coffee maker (ADC). A second exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which a pre-compression step is carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step so that the coffee tablet obtained exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A third exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee, has a density of at least 0.95 g/cm 3 , and exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A fourth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and at least 1.5 wt. % propylene glycol, and exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A fifth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and at least 1.5 wt. % of a liquid flavor carrier, and exhibits a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. A sixth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and an amount of instant coffee large enough to improve at least one mechanical property of the tablet selected from binding strength, ease of disintegration, and brewing efficiency (as determined by the amount of coffee solids extracted from the tablet when subjected to brewing in an ADC). A seventh exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee, and exhibits a hardness of at least about 50 N (Newtons) and a friability of no greater than about 3.5%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. An eighth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee, has a mass less than about 4 g, and exhibits a friability of no greater than about 6% and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, wherein ten (10) of the tablets, unbroken, are capable of brewing with 1420 ml of water in an automatic drip coffee maker a consumable coffee beverage having an absorbance of 1.1-3.5 or 1.25-2.75 or 1.7-2.5, and wherein the coffee tablets exhibit a yield greater than 26% when brewed in the ADC. A ninth exemplary coffee tablet comprises at least about 91% ground roast coffee and exhibits a friability of no greater than about 6%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, wherein ten (10) of the tablets, unbroken, are capable of brewing with 1420 ml of water in an automatic drip coffee maker a consumable coffee beverage having an absorbance per gram of >0.07 or >0.09, and wherein the coffee tablets exhibit a yield greater than 26% when brewed in the ADC. A tenth exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which at least a first compression and a separate second compression are carried out in the same compaction die in such a manner that the coffee tablet obtained exhibits a hardness of at least about 40 N (Newtons) and a friability of no greater than about 6%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in an ADC. An eleventh exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which a pre-compression step is carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step wherein the pre-compression compaction force is ˜20% to <100%, ˜30% to ˜90%, ˜40% to ˜80%, or ˜50% to ˜75%, or ˜50% to ˜60% of the compaction force used in the main compression step. A twelfth exemplary coffee tablet is made by a multi-step compaction process in which a pre-compression step is carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step wherein the pre-compression pressure is ˜20% to <100%, ˜30% to ˜90%, ˜40% to ˜80%, or ˜50% to ˜75%, or ˜50% to ˜60% of the pressure used in the main compression step. An exemplary process for producing a coffee tablet includes subjecting ground roast coffee to a multi-step compaction process including a pre-compression step and a subsequent main compression step, the pre-compression step being carried out at a lower compaction force but in the same compaction die as the main compression step so as to produce a coffee tablet exhibiting a hardness when dry of at least about 30 N (Newtons), a friability when dry of no greater than about 10%, and readily disintegrates when contacted with hot water during brewing in the ADC.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Terminology Unless otherwise indicated expressly or from context, the following terms will have the following meanings: “Binder” means a material which improves the strength of the ground roast coffee tablets made in accordance with this invention. “Binder” does not include ingredients which, although providing some binding activity, provide some other function in significant amount such as contributing to taste, health effects, etc. “Brewed coffee” means a liquid coffee drink formed by extracting coffee solids from ground, roasted coffee beans or substitutes. “Brewed coffee” includes coffee drinks formed from regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, instant coffee and coffee substitutes such as chicory. “Coffee,” “regular coffee,” and “ground roast coffee” mean a mass of solid, non-decaffeinated particles derived by comminuting roasted coffee beans. “Coffee product” means any product derived from coffee beans. “Coffee substitute” refers to a substance which is customarily used as a replacement for coffee such as ground roast chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn/maize, barley, rye, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet. “Decaffeinated coffee” refers to a solid derived from coffee beans, both roasted and unroasted, which contain a substantially reduced concentration of caffeine. “Density,” as it relates to ground roast coffee and unless otherwise indicated, refers to the number of ounces of that coffee that are needed to fill a container having a predetermined standard volume. Historically in the United States, one pound (16 ounces or 454 g) of ground roast coffee had a standard density of ˜0.4 g/cc and a conventional moisture content of about 1-7%. However, technologies have allowed lower density coffees to be made, so today a more standard density is ˜0.33 g/cc. Even lower densities are possible, such as ˜0.263 g/cc. “Free-standing” in reference to a coffee tablet means that the coffee tablet is not housed in a filter paper container (or other container made from a similar material) which is intended to remain in place, around the tablet, when the tablet is contacted with hot water for brewing. “Flavor Carrier” refers to a material for containing, carrying, or otherwise being mixed with coffee flavorant to facilitate using the coffee flavorant. Coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of such flavor carriers, which are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. For example flavorants may be added to a flavor carrier in a proportion so that a consistent weight percentage (e.g., 3%) of the final carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be added to ground roast coffee regardless of the particular flavorant or flavor carrier. Flavor carriers can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms and carrier-containing flavorant compositions added to ground roast coffee can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. “Instant coffee” refers to a flowable, particulate coffee product that has been made by evaporating water from a previously made brewed coffee, usually by concentration and drying. Typical drying means, such as spray drying and freeze drying are known in the art. An example of instant coffee production may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,466, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. “Standard serving of brewed coffee” refers, for each country of the world, brewed coffee as customarily served in that country. For example, in the United States, brewed coffee is served in two different ways, regular strength and espresso strength. In both cases, about 3-5 grams of ground roast coffee is used to make the brewed coffee. An exemplary Folgers brand medium roast, ADC ground coffee is brewed using about 3 grams of the ground roast coffee having a density of about 0.33 g/cc to make the brew. Regular strength coffee is made with about 5-6 fluid ounces (˜150-175 ml) of water, while espresso strength coffee is made with about 1.9 fluid ounces (˜55 ml) of water. Thus, in the United States, a “standard serving of brewed coffee” will be understood as referring to 5-6 fluid ounces (˜150-175 ml) of regular strength brewed coffee as well as to roughly 1.9 fluid ounces (˜55 ml) of espresso strength brewed coffee. Automatic Drip Coffee Makers This invention is intended for use with any automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) designed for producing brewed coffee by hot water extraction in which hot water is dripped onto a bed of ground roast coffee. While hot water at a wide range of temperatures may be employed, exemplary temperature ranges for hot water for brewing may include about 70-120° C., about 80-110° C., about 80-100° C., or about 90-100° C. Normally, the ground roast coffee is deposited in a “brew basket,” i.e., a container having an open top and a floor defining one or more outlet openings, the brew basket containing a paper or metal mesh or plastic mesh coffee filter in most instances. Brew baskets are often shaped in the form of a truncated cone or other similar wedge shapes, so that their side walls direct flow to the more confined area of the containers' floor. The most common brew baskets are referred to as “basket” style and “cone” style. Once activated, the machine automatically heats water previously placed in its water reservoir and then causes this heated brewing water to drip down onto the coffee bed in the brew basket over a suitable period of time (the “brewing cycle time”). Another style of machine has a reservoir of hot water that is displaced by new water added. In either case, the machine delivers hot water at or slightly above atmospheric pressure, which is somewhat below boiling to about boiling, to the brew basket. As the water passes through the coffee bed, coffee flavor solids are extracted from the ground roast coffee, thereby producing brewed coffee. The brewed coffee so made then passes through the coffee filter and then through the outlet opening or openings in the brew basket, where it is collected in a suitable carafe normally positioned below the outlet opening or openings. Automatic drip coffee makers come in many different sizes. Most automatic drip coffee makers for consumer use are designed to produce 4-12 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. A first variation of automatic drip coffee makers have an option for brewing one to three standard servings. A second variation of automatic drip coffee makers, typically known as “4 cup” brewers, are designed to brew up to four standard servings. A few are even capable of brewing a single cup, although these are typically high pressure brewers and not “drip” brewers. Automatic drip coffee makers for commercial or industrial use are typically designed for producing 10 to 30 standard servings of brewed coffee per brewing cycle. The inventive ground roast coffee tablets can be used with all such automatic drip coffee makers, regardless of the configuration of their brew baskets. Thus, the minimum number of servings for which a coffee brewer is designed can vary from machine to machine and may be one serving, four servings, ten servings, or some other number of servings. While the inventive coffee tablets of the present application may advantageously be used with many different types of coffee makers, including many different types of automatic drip coffee makers, the specific brew performance characteristics (e.g., yield, % brew solids, total brew solids, absorbance, etc.) described herein correspond to brewing the inventive coffee tablets in a 4-12 cup automatic drip coffee maker (“ADC”) having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5 g/sec to 3.1 g/sec, for example, a water delivery rate of about 2.7 to 2.8 g/sec. Two such ADC's are the Mr. Coffee® Model DR13 coffee maker and the Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) coffee maker, both of which have a water delivery rate of approximately 2.75 g/sec. As expected, ADC's having substantially higher water delivery rates may produce lower total extraction (and corresponding lower brew solids concentrations, yields, and absorbances), as the faster flowing water has less time to absorb the coffee solids. However, relative to the brew performance of the corresponding roasted and ground coffee under the same brewing conditions, the relative brew solids indices, yield ratios, or absorbance ratios of coffee brewed using an ADC with a higher water delivery rate (for example, the Bunn® Pour-Omatic GR, having a water delivery rate of approximately 10 to 11 g/sec) may be comparable to those described herein for ADC's having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5 g/sec to 3.1 g/sec. Ingredients The coffee tablets of this invention can be made from virtually any type of ground roast coffee. Ground roast coffee is made from coffee beans, which are the seeds of “cherries” that grow on coffee trees in a narrow subtropical region around the world. There are many coffee varieties, however, it is generally recognized that there are two primary commercial coffee species: Coffea arabica (herein “Arabica(s)”) and Coffea canephora var. robusta (herein “Robusta(s)”). Coffees from the species arabica may be described as “Brazils,” which come from Brazil, or “Other Milds” which are grown in other premium coffee producing countries. Premium Arabica countries are generally recognized as including Colombia, Guatemala, Sumatra, Indonesia, Costa Rica, Mexico, United States (Hawaii), El Salvador, Peru, Kenya, Ethiopia and Jamaica. Coffees from the species canephora var. robusta are typically used as a low cost extender or as a source of additional caffeine for Arabica coffees. These Robusta coffees are typically grown in the lower regions of West and Central Africa, India, South East Asia, Indonesia, and Brazil. See, US 2008/0118604, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Virtually any of the above varieties and types of coffees can be used to make the inventive coffee tablets. One ground roast coffee without any binder or liquid flavor carrier acting as a binder resulted in tablets with very poor hardness and friability. This coffee had a coffee bulk density of about 0.353 g/cm 3 , a moisture content of about 2.2%, and a relatively high percentage of “fines.” While not intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the combination of low moisture, high density, and a high fines percentage combined to cause these relatively poor results. Mixtures of different coffee varieties and types can also be used. When removed from the coffee cherry, coffee beans normally have a distinctly green color and a high moisture content. Therefore, they are normally dried prior to export, typically to a moisture content of about 12%. Historically, solar drying was the method of choice, although machine drying is now normally used due to the reliability and efficiency of the machine dryers available for this purpose. See, Sivetz et al., Coffee Technology , “Drying Green Coffee Beans”, pp. 112-169 (1979). Sivetz also highlights the irreversible damage over-drying can have on coffee quality. After drying to a moisture content of about 12%, the coffee beans are typically exported to consuming nations where they are processed into conventional ground roast coffee by roasting followed by grinding. Any of the variety of roasting techniques known to the art can be used to roast the green coffee in the process of this invention. In the normal operation of preparing conventional roast and ground coffee, coffee beans may be roasted in a hot gas medium at temperature ranges of about 176.8-371.1° C. (350-700° F.), or about 176.8-260° C. (350-500° F.), or about 204.4-232.2° C. (400-450° F.), or about 260-287.8° C. (500-550° F.), or about 315.6-348.9° C. (600-660° F.), with the time of roasting being dependent on the flavor characteristics desired in the coffee beverage when brewed. Where coffee beans are roasted in a batch process, the batch roasting time at the hereinbefore given temperatures is generally from about 2 minutes to about 20 minutes, and may, for example, be about 10-20 minutes or about 12-18 minutes, or may be about 2-10 minutes, or about 2-6 minutes, or about 2-4 minutes, or about 2-3 minutes. Where coffee beans are roasted in a continuous process, the residence time of the coffee beans in the roaster is typically from about 30 seconds to about 9 minutes, and may, for example, be about 30 seconds to 6 about minutes, or about 30 seconds to about 4 minutes, or about 1-3 minutes. The roasting procedure can involve static bed roasting as well as fluidized bed roasting. A preferred type of roasting would be using fast roasters. While any method of heat transfer can be used in this regard, convective heat transfer, especially forced convection, is normally used for convenience. The convective media can be an inert gas or, more typically, air. Typically, the beans are charged to a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from about 350° to about 1200° F. (about 177° C. to about 649° C.) preferably from about 400° F. to about 800° F. (about 204° C. to about 427° C.), at roast times form about 10 seconds to not longer than about 5.5 minutes, preferably from about 10 to about 47 seconds. As well known to coffee professionals, it is conventional to refer to the degree or extent to which coffee beans are roasted in terms of their Hunter color level. The Hunter Color “L” scale system is generally used to define the color of the coffee beans and the degree to which they have been roasted. Hunter Color “L” scale values are units of light reflectance measurement, and the higher the value is, the lighter the color is since a lighter colored material reflects more light. Thus, in measuring degrees of roast, the lower the “L” scale value the greater the degree of roast, since the greater the degree of roast, the darker is the color of the roasted bean. This roast color is usually measured on the roasted, quenched and cooled coffee beans prior to subsequent processing (e.g., grinding and/or flaking) into a brewed coffee product. However, color may be measured on finished product, in which case the color will be designated as such. See, pages 985-95 of R. S. Hunter, “Photoelectric Color Difference Meter,” J. of the Optical Soc. of Amer ., Volume 48 (1958). The ground roast coffee used to make the inventive coffee tablets can be made from coffee beans roasted to any desired roast color from about 10 L (very dark) to about 25 L (very light). In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the coffee beans will be fast roasted to an average color of from about 13 to about 19 Hunter L units, preferably from about 14 to about 18 Hunter L units, and even about 15 to about 17 Hunter L units. Once the coffee beans are roasted, they are ground to a desired average particle size. Average particles sizes on the order of as low as 250 μm (microns) and as high as 3 mm, as measured by Laser Diffraction on a Sympatec Rodos Helos laser particle size analyzer, are conventional. Average particle sizes on the order of 400 μm to 1,000 μm, 500 μm to 800 μm, and even 650 μm to 750 μm, 800 μm to 950 and 850 μm to 900 μm are more interesting. The coffee beans may be ground to other average particle sizes, including for example, average particle sizes of about 400 μm to 1.5 mm, or about 300 μm to about 1,000 or even about 1-2 mm. It is also recognized that larger coffee particles may be broken down during tablet compaction, resulting in smaller average particle sizes within the compacted coffee tablet. The ground roast coffee tablets of this invention can be made from ground roast coffees ground to any of these particle sizes. Coffee flakes can also be used. Of course, there can be a size distribution around these mean particle sizes, so that the grind can be further characterized by breadth of distribution. One convenient measure is Q250, the percent of particles less than 250 microns, which represents the amount of finer particles (or “fines”) that are included in the distribution and that help make up the mean size. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees exhibit different bulk densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. In accordance with this invention, the inventive coffee tablets can be made for ground roast coffee having any conventional density. So, for example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from ground roast coffees having “regular” densities ranging between about 0.26 g/cc to 0.35 g/cc such as, for example, 0.263 g/cc, 0.288 g/cc, 0.325 g/cc, and 0.35 g/cc, if desired. Alternatively, the inventive coffee tablets can also be made for ground roast coffees having greater or lesser densities, if desired. For example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from high density coffees having densities of >0.4 g/cc, e.g., densities of up to ˜0.6 g/cc, although even higher densities are contemplated. Similarly, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from low density coffees having densities of <0.18 g/cc to 0.26 g/cc, e.g., densities of 0.18 g/cc to 0.26 g/cc, 0.20 g/cc to 0.25 g/cc, or even 0.22 g/cc to 0.23 g/cc (such as ˜0.19 g/cc, ˜0.20 g/cc, ˜0.21 g/cc, ˜0.22 g/cc, ˜0.23 g/cc, ˜0.24 g/cc or even ˜0.25 g/cc). In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757 for a description of how to make low density coffees and U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,188 for a description of how to make high density coffees. The entire disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. As appreciated by skilled coffee professionals, different ground coffees also exhibit different moisture contents depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, and other factors. So, for example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from ground roast coffees having moisture contents of ˜1 to ˜7 wt. %, ˜2 to ˜7 wt. %, ˜2 to ˜6 wt. %, ˜3 to ˜6 wt. % and ˜4 to ˜5.5 wt. %. Some ground roast coffees having a moisture content less than ˜2.5 wt. % may not make tablets with acceptable friability without the use of a binder or liquid flavor carrier acting as a binder; thus, any of these ranges might have a lower boundary of ˜2.5 wt. %. Generally speaking, the inventive coffee tablets can also be made from mixtures of two or more of the coffees described above. So, for example, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from mixtures of ground roast coffees having different densities, different Hunter L colors, different particle sizes, different moisture contents, and different combinations thereof (i.e., one ground roast coffee could have a low density and a high moisture content while another ground roast coffee could have a medium density and a low moisture content). Thus, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from mixtures of regular and high density coffees, mixtures of regular and low density coffees, mixtures of high and low density coffees, and mixtures of high, regular and low density coffees, if desired. In addition, the inventive coffee tablets can be made from mixtures ground roast coffees having high and low Hunter L color numbers, large and small average particle sizes, etc. In addition to the above ground roast coffees, additional ingredients can be included in the ground roast coffee tablets of this invention. For example, decaffeinated varieties of the above coffees can be used in addition to, or in place of, the ground roast coffees described above. Similarly, coffee substitutes such as ground chicory, roasted soybeans, and roasted grains such as corn, rye, wheat, barley, oats, rice, wheat germ, spelt, buckwheat, and millet can be included in the inventive ground roast coffee tablets. (Instant coffee is not a “coffee substitute” in this context.) Coffee flavorings, as further discussed below, can be included. Also, various excipients such as binders and disintegration aids can be included. Examples of suitable solid particulate binders include starches, sugars, modified starches, maltrodextrins, polydextroses, carrageenans, gums, soluble fibers, celluloses, waxes, gelatin, sugars, including sucrose, glucose, dextrose, molasses and lactose, natural and synthetic gums, including acacia sodium alginate, extract of Irish moss, panwar gum, ghatti gum, mucilage of isapol husks, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, Veegum, larch arabogalactan, polyethyleneglycol, ethylcellulose, any salts of these compounds, and mixtures thereof can be included as binders. More interesting solid binders are carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, maltodextrin, gelatin, gum arabic, gum agar, modified corn starch, and mixtures thereof. See, for example, EP 813816 B1, U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,431, U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,428, EP 0229920 and U.S. Pat. No. 1,951,357. Surprisingly, it has been found that some liquid flavor carriers act as a binder in coffee tablets. Suitable liquid flavor carriers include those having viscosities of 15 to 65 cP (centipoise), 35 to 65 cP, 40 to 60 cP, or even 45 to 56 cP and surface tensions of 30 to 50 dynes/cm, 35 to 45 dynes/cm, or even 35 to 40 dynes/cm at 25 C. Propylene glycol is a good example of a liquid flavor carrier that acts as a binder in coffee tablets. Other examples include but are not limited to glycerin, other polyols, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Binders, if used, will normally be present in an amount of ≦˜10 wt. %, ˜0.5 to ˜7 wt. %, ˜1 to ˜5 wt. %, or even ˜1.5 to 4 wt. %, or even ˜2 to ˜4 wt. %, based on the weight of the entire composition. However, addition of one or more binders is not required, and indeed in many embodiments the inventive coffee tablets are essentially free of binders. Mixtures of all of the above ingredients, i.e., mixtures of different ground roast coffees, different ground roast decaffeinated coffees, different ground roast coffee substitutes, different flavorings and/or different excipients, can also be used. If so, the amount of ground roast coffee (both regular and decaffeinated) included in the ground roast coffee solid used to make the inventive ground roast coffee tablets will normally be at least about 50 wt. %, more typically at least about 75 wt. %, at least about 80 wt. %, at least about 85 wt. %, at least about 90 wt. %, at least about 91 wt. %, at least about 92.5 wt. %, or even at least about 95 wt. %., based on the weight of the tablets ultimately produced. Moreover, although some or all of this ground roast coffee can be decaffeinated, it is also desirable at least in some embodiments that essentially all of the ground roast coffee is “regular,” i.e., non-decaffeinated coffee. Embodiments in which at least 5 wt. %, at least 10 wt. %, at least 25 wt. %, at least 50 wt. %, at least 75 wt. %, or even at least 90 wt. % of the ground roast coffee in the inventive tablets is decaffeinated are contemplated, as are embodiments in which essentially all of the ground roast coffee in the tablets is decaffeinated. Tablet Size and Configuration Although the inventive coffee tablets can be made in any size, they are normally designed at least in some embodiments to produced a single standard serving of brewed coffee, or a whole multiple or major fraction of a single standard serving. For example, in some embodiments, the inventive coffee tablets may be designed to produce whole multiples of a single standard serving, e.g., to produce two standard servings of brewed coffee or three standard servings. In other embodiments, the inventive coffee tablets may be made larger, to produce more than a single serving of coffee, and may be designed with surface scoring to allow a user to preferentially break the tablets into smaller pre-designated portions (i.e. break the tablet in half or into fourths, etc.), and the individual portions could then be used to produce separate coffee servings. In other embodiments, the inventive coffee tablets may be designed to produce a major fraction of a standard single serving such as ½ of a standard serving, or ⅓ of standard serving, or ¼ of standard serving. If so, the inventive coffee tablets will contain a correspondingly greater or lesser amount of ground roast coffee. This does not necessarily mean that using one single coffee tablet designed to produce a single standard serving in a standard automatic drip coffee maker will necessarily always result in one single serving of acceptable brewed coffee. Many standard automatic drip coffee makers are configured to make, at minimum, more than one serving of coffee at a time, e.g., four (4) servings of coffee at a minimum, and the inventive coffee tablets are not necessarily able to overcome that limitation of such coffee brewers. For such tablets designed to produce a single standard serving of coffee, one would expect, for example, four of such tablets to produce four servings of acceptable brewed coffee, five of such tablets to produce five servings of acceptable brewed coffee, seven of such tablets to produce seven servings of acceptable brewed coffee, etc. For an automatic drip coffee maker designed to brew one serving of coffee at a time, one may be expected to use one tablet per serving. Of course, the consumer may add or reduce these numbers to control strength of the brewed coffee to match their particular taste preference (e.g., any one or more or fewer tablets than this one-tablet-per-serving ratio, such as five tablets to make four servings, six tablets to make four servings, three tablets to make four servings, etc.). As indicated above, different ground coffees exhibit different densities depending on the type of coffee used, the method by which the coffee is roasted, the color of the roasted coffee, the particle size to which the coffee is ground, moisture content, and other factors. A typical ground roast coffee having a density of 0.33 g/cc and a standard moisture content of about 1-7% requires approximately 3 grams to produce a standard serving of brewed coffee, both regular and espresso strength, at least in the United States. Thus, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets, when designed to produce one standard serving of brewed coffee per tablet, will normally contain about 3±1 grams of ground roast coffee, based on a density of 0.33 g/cc and a standard moisture content of about 1-7%, more typically about 3±0.5 grams of ground roast coffee. Exemplary inventive coffee tablets may have a mass of less than about 4 grams, less than about 3.5 grams, less than about 3.3 grams, less than about 2.7 grams, about 2.6 to 2.8 grams, or even a mass of about 1.9 grams to about 2.7 grams. Ground roast coffees of greater or less densities, e.g., 0.288 g/cc, (and greater or lesser moisture contents, as further discussed below) require correspondingly less or greater amounts of coffee to produce a standard serving of brewed coffee. When a ground roast coffee having a density of 0.33 g/cc and a standard moisture content of about 1-7% is used for producing a single standard serving of coffee, approximately 3 grams of this coffee will be required, as indicated above. This volume of ground roast coffee will produce a generally cylindrical tablet measuring approximately 25 mm in diameter and 6-7 mm in thickness when compacted in a typical compaction process carried out in accordance with this invention, as further described below. When coffees of different densities and/or moisture contents are used, correspondingly different tablet volumes will be achieved. Similarly, inventive tablets made with different dose sizes, e.g., a tablet made to produce ⅓ of a standard serving of brewed coffee per tablet, will also have correspondingly different sizes. Different tablet configurations are also possible. For example, oval, heart, “pillow” and other shapes are anticipated. Further, at least one side of a generally cylindrical tablet may be concave. Additionally or alternatively, the outer surface of a tablet may have ridges, bumps, surface scoring, or embossments. Packaging and Use The inventive ground roast coffee tablets are intended to be provided to the customer, both consumers and commercial/industrial users, in suitable packages. Many types of packages and packaging material can be used for this purpose including bags made from plastic, paper, foil, cellophane or other suitable material; boxes made from cardboard, rigid plastic, foamed plastic, etc.; bottles, sleeves, etc. Combinations of these packages can also be used. If desired, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets can be packaged in specific numbers for making predetermined amounts of coffee. For example, tablets designed to produce a single serving of coffee per tablet can be packaged in groups of four to facilitate making four cups of coffee in a single brew cycle. Alternatively, groups of two or more tablets can be packaged together to facilitate making a single serving of coffee in a single brew cycle. For example, three tablets designed to produce ⅓ serving of coffee per tablet can be packaged in groups of three to facilitate making a single serving of coffee in a single brew cycle. The tablet packages can be designed to be resealable for the convenience of the customer. In such a configuration, as the tablets are periodically used by the consumer, the unused tablets that remain could be resealed in the package to retain product freshness. A particular advantage of this invention is that, because the inventive coffee tablets contain a predetermined amount and type of ground roast coffee (and other optional ingredients), adjusting dosages to achieve the precise flavor desired is made much easier. For example, a consumer desiring to make a stronger brewed coffee than normal can use five inventive coffee tablets (of a single serving size) rather than four for brewing four servings of brewed coffee. As another advantage, inventive coffee tablets differing in one or more properties may be combined in the same brew to produce a preferred brew in which the one or more properties resulting from the combination of differing coffee tablets provide a desired flavor, strength, caffeine content, or other such characteristic in the preferred brew. For example, a brewed coffee with a desired reduced caffeine content may be prepared by combining at least one or a portion of one regular caffeinated coffee tablet with at least one or a portion of one decaffeinated coffee tablet in an ADC coffee maker. As another example, a brewed coffee with a desired “darkness” of roast flavor may be prepared by combining at least one or a portion of one dark roasted coffee tablet with at least one or a portion of one regular coffee tablet in an ADC coffee maker. In still another example, a brewed coffee with a combination of special flavorings may be prepared by combining at least one or a portion of one coffee tablet having a first flavoring (for example, chocolate) with at least one or a portion of one coffee tablet having a second flavoring (for example, hazelnut) in an ADC coffee maker. In still other embodiments, multiple properties may be varied or adjusted by using coffee tablets differing in two or more properties. As one specific example, a consumer desiring to make a brewed coffee having a reduced caffeine content and a “hint” of French vanilla flavor can use three inventive coffee tablets made from regular ground roast coffee, two tablets made from decaffeinated coffee, and one tablet of French vanilla flavored coffee. Further, some coffee tablets may be provided with two or more varied properties, such as, for example, dark roasted decaffeinated coffee tablets, medium roasted decaffeinated coffee tablets, and dark roasted regular coffee tablets. An exemplary consumer selected blend could then include three dark roasted coffee tablets with five medium roast decaffeinated coffee tablets and four cinnamon-flavored coffee tablets. In view of the above advantages, methods of brewing coffee are contemplated comprising (a) placing at least one or a portion of one of a first type of coffee tablet and at least one or a portion of one of a second type of coffee tablet into an ADC coffee maker and (b) actuating a brew cycle of the ADC coffee maker to brew coffee with the coffee tablets or coffee tablet portions. Variables that may be adjusted by selecting one or more tablets of different types of ground roast coffee include, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, levels of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee (e.g., Arabica, robusta), and alternative coffee bean treatment (e.g., low moisture drying prior to roasting). A wide variety of types of coffee tablets may be provided together in a pre-packaged kit, or in a consumer selected array, to facilitate preparation of a preferred brew specific to an individual consumer's preferences. As such, an exemplary kit may include a plurality of tablets, with at least two of the tablets having a different predetermined property, such as, for example, amount or type of flavorant, caffeine content, level of acidity, darkness of roast, species of coffee, or type, of coffee bean treatment. Such a kit may be provided with instructions for combining the two or more types of coffee tablets to prepare a desired brewed coffee. These instructions may include one or more “recipes” for preparing one or more special predetermined blends of coffee. A further advantage of the inventive coffee tablets is that they are smaller in size than conventional ground roast coffee on a comparable basis, i.e., based on the same amount of coffee provided. This allows the inventive coffee tablets to be marketed, transported and sold in smaller packages, which in turn is beneficial for the environment. Tablets with a volume less than 3.2 cm 3 , less than 2.9 cm 3 , and less than 2.3 cm 3 are of particular interest. In use, the appropriate number of tablets will be removed from their package(s), manually placed in the brew basket of an automatic drip coffee maker, and then brewed into brewed coffee in the normal way. Tablet Manufacture In accordance with this invention, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets are made in such a way that they disintegrate essentially immediately (or at least very rapidly) when contacted with hot brewing water at the beginning of the brewing cycle, as indicated above. In addition, they are also made to resist significant degradation from the manual handling they receive during manufacture and use. In particular, the inventive coffee tablets are made to have sufficient hardness and friability before brewing to withstand all aspects of manufacture, handling, packaging, transport and use without breakage to any significant degree. This is accomplished in accordance with this invention by making the inventive ground roast coffee tablets by multi-step compaction, i.e., by compressing ground roast coffee into shaped articles by a multi-step compaction process carried out in the same compaction die in which the ground roast coffee is compressed at a first compaction pressure and then subsequently further compressed at least one more time in the same compaction die. Many of the tablets herein discussed were made in multi-step compaction process carried out in the same compaction die in which the ground roast coffee is pre-compressed at a relatively lower compaction pressure and then subsequently further compressed at a relatively higher pressure in a main or primary compaction step. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that this approach allows stronger tablets to be produced than would otherwise by the case if an otherwise identical tablet having an otherwise identical density were made by a single-step compaction process. That is to say, coffee tablets made by the inventive multi-step compaction process are stronger (as measured by hardness, friability or both, as further discussed below) than otherwise identical tablets having the same density but made by a conventional single-step compaction process. In the alternative, tablets can be made using a multi-step compaction process carried out in the same compaction die in which the ground roast coffee is compressed at a relatively higher compaction pressure initially and then subsequently further compressed at a relatively lower pressure in a separate compaction step. This second approach may be problematic for some machines, because they use a measured highest compaction force or pressure to control how much material is deposited into the die (with a higher than desired force indicating that too much material has been deposited) and controlling based on a higher pre-compression may be less accurate than controlling based on a higher main compression. Although many of the examples herein are carried out with a relatively lower compaction pressure initially and then subsequently further compressed at a relatively higher pressure in a separate compaction step, and much of the teachings herein are in this context, it is to be understood that many of the advantages taught herein can be obtained using three or more total compactions in the same die and/or a relatively higher compaction pressure at other than the final compression step, and the virtually any of the methods herein can be thought of as being capable of being carried out using three or more total compactions in the same die and/or a relatively higher compaction pressure at other than the final compression step (e.g., first or second or third non-final compression). Although the inventive multi-step compaction process will normally be carried out with two compaction steps, one, two, three or more additional, intermediate compaction steps can also be used, usually at compaction pressures between the compaction pressures encountered in the pre-compression and main compression steps. However, greater or lesser compaction pressures can also be used in the intermediate compaction steps, if desired. Compressive or compaction forces on the order of ˜25 to ˜80 kN (kiloNewtons), ˜35 to ˜65 kN, or even ˜40 to ˜50 kN have been found suitable for the main compression step (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm). Thus, these main compressive forces will normally be >˜25 kN, >˜35 kN, >˜40 kN, and, in addition, generally <˜80 kN, <˜55 kN, or even <˜50 kN. Expressed as applied pressure during compaction (assuming a 24.5 mm tablet diameter), the corresponding compressions would be >˜53.0 MPa (or N/mm 2 ), >˜74.2 MPa, >˜84.8 MPa, and, in addition, generally <˜169.6 MPa, <˜116.7 MPa, or even <˜106.1 MPa. Greater or lesser compressive forces can be used depending on the type, particle size and other properties of the ground roast coffee being processed, the desired density, strength and hardness of the coffee tablet being produced, and certain production variables as further discussed below, and can easily be determined by routine experimentation based on the teachings herein. A number of processes are known for forming tablets and other shaped articles from granular materials by compression. Most such processes require (1) filling a die, typically closed off at the bottom by a bottom tool, with the material to be tabletted (2) compressing the filled material between upper and lower tools, and (3) ejecting the tablet so formed from the die. Presses may be single station or multiple station. In this context, a “station” refers to a single die and its associated top and bottom tools. In a single station press, a single stationary die is used, and all functions (e.g., filling, compression and ejection) occur in the same location. In a multiple station press such as a rotary tablet press, multiple sets of dies and their associated top and bottom tools are moved from location to location where the separate functions of filling, pre-compression, main compression and ejection occur. For example, a typical rotary table press has a turret containing a die table formed from multiple die stations. The turret containing the die table rotates through the press so that each die is serially brought to the different filling, pressing and ejection locations in the press. Dies are filled at the filling location, the material to be tabletted compacted in the pre-compression and main compression locations, and the tablet formed thereby ejected from the die at the ejection location. Actuation of the top and/or bottom tools for compressing the material to be compacted in the pre-compression and main compression locations can be done in a variety of different ways, including using cams, ramps, compression rollers or combinations thereof, all of which are designed to force the bottom and top tools associated with each die together. The size of the compression rollers or other tool compressing mechanisms may limit the proximity of the pre-compression and main compression locations, which may, for example, be separated by approximately ¼ of the die circle circumference. While the coffee material may be under compression during this delay period, in one embodiment, the die tools may be held in proximity to the compression positions without exerting additional compaction forces, for example, by holding the tools using tracks, ramps, or other mechanisms provided with the rotary tablet press. This delay between pre-compression and main compression steps may have a duration of approximately 80-900 milliseconds, or 150-400 milliseconds, or 200-290 milliseconds, under normal rotary tablet press operating speeds (e.g., 15-60 rpm), or about 15-23 times either of the pre-compression and/or the main compression dwell times. Therefore, while each of the pre-compression and main compression steps may be very brief (for example, pre-compression and main compression dwell times ranging from 7-45 milliseconds), the total time from the start of the pre-compression step to the completion of the main compression step may be 8-15 times the total time under compression at the pre-compression and main compression rollers. This total compression time may be, for example, approximately 0.1 to 1 second, approximately 0.18 to 0.5 seconds, or 0.22 to 0.36 seconds. As such, even minor adjustments to the dwell times of the pre-compression and main compression steps may result in significant changes to the tablet production rates, as adjustments to the rotary press operating speed are generally proportional to these dwell time adjustments. In a typical rotary press, each die is subjected to one set of compressions, for production of one table, per die, in a single, 360° revolution of the turret. In other rotary presses, additional filling, compression and ejection locations may be provided for production of two or more tablets, per die, in a single 360° revolution of the turret. While pre-compression locations have been included in typical rotary tablet presses, the amount of pre-compression forces applied during prior art tabletting has generally been minimal, the purpose of which being to force or squeeze pockets of air out of the powder to be tabletted, to prevent voids or fractures in the resulting tablet. Generally speaking, longer compression dwell times require less compression force in the main or primary compression step. Some increases in dwell time may be accomplished by increasing the size of the portions of the tools impacted by the compression rollers or other compression mechanism, often referred to as the tool heads. However, more substantial increases in compression dwell time typically require slower machine operating speeds, such that the top and bottom tools are aligned with the compression rollers (or other compression mechanism) for the desired dwell time period. As such, a substantially longer dwell time for compaction of the tablet generally limits the tablet production rate by requiring a substantially slower machine operating speed, thereby slowing down other steps of the tabletting process (e.g., filling, pre-compression, or ejection of completed tablet). As further indicated above, the compressive forces used for a particular application of this invention also depend on the desired properties of the inventive ground roast coffee tablets to be produced. In this regard, it has been found that, within certain limits, greater compressive forces lead to stronger tablets, and conversely, lesser or reduced compressive forces lead to weaker tablets. On the other hand, compressive forces which are too high can weaken the tablet. Indeed, reliance on increases in compressive forces alone, without regard to dwell time, amount of pre-compression, or other such factors, may be insufficient to produce tablets of desired strength, as shown, for example, in the working examples (see, e.g., Example 14). The strength/robustness of the ground roast coffee tablets of this invention can conveniently be measured in several ways, two examples of which include measuring a tablet's hardness and friability. Hardness measures the force required to break the tablet in an axial direction. Tablet hardness can be determined by a diametral compression test in which the tablet is placed between two anvils and a pressure is applied to the anvils until the tablet breaks. The crushing strength that just causes the tablet to break is taken as the hardness of the tablet, which is sometimes referred to as the “tablet crushing strength.” The hardness of an article can be determined using any number of devices and techniques known to skilled coffee professionals, including, for example, the Stokes (Monsanto) tester, the Strong-Cobb tester, the Pfizer tester, the Erweka tester, the Heberlein (or Schleuniger) tester, the Key tester, the Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester, and the Van der Kamp tester, and the techniques associated with each of these devices. In accordance with this invention, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets are normally made to have a hardness of ≧˜30 N (Newtons), when measured using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode. Hardnesses on the order of ≧˜40 N, or ≧˜50 N, are even more interesting, while hardnesses of ≧˜60 N, ≧˜70 N, ≧˜80 N, ≧˜90 N, ≧˜100 N, and even ≧˜110 N and more are possible. Friability measures the amount of material that flakes, falls, or chips off the tablets after being tumbled under a predetermined set of conditions. For convenience, the friability of the inventive coffee tablets can be measured using a commercially-available Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber friability drum by rotating 25 grams of the tablets in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these tablets that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. The tablets should not be broken to obtain 25 grams, but adjust the number of whole tablets to come as close as possible to 25 grams. The weight of material passing through this screen in proportion to the total weight of the original charge of tablets represents the friability of these tablets. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that the inventive coffee tablets, when made in the manner indicated above, may have a friability of <˜10%, <˜8%, <˜6%, <˜3.5%, <˜3%, or even <˜1%. Generally speaking, coffee tablets having the above combination of properties, i.e., a hardness of at least about 30 N (Newtons) and a friability of less than about 10%, will have a density on the order of ≧0.85 g/cm 3 , ≧0.87 g/cm 3 , ≧0.90 g/cm 3 , ≧0.92 g/cm 3 , ≧0.95 g/cm 3 , ≧0.97 g/cm 3 , and even ≧0.99 g/cm 3 . Coffee tablets having densities of ≧0.90 g/cm 3 , ≧0.92 g/cm 3 , ≧0.95 g/cm 3 , ≧0.97 g/cm 3 , and even ≧0.99 g/cm 3 are especially interesting. An external coating can enhance the tablet strength, allowing tabletting at a reduced compaction force. Any material described above as useful for making a binder to be included in the inventive coffee tablets can be used for making such coatings. In accordance with this invention, the inventive ground roast coffee tablets are made to have the above properties by using a multi-step compaction process comprising two or more compression steps, a pre-compression step, a main or primary compression step, and optionally, one or more intermediate compression steps, all of which are carried out in the same die. In other words, once the ground roast coffee is filled into a particular compaction die, it is subjected to all of the compactions steps need to produce a completed coffee tablet in that same die before being ejected therefrom. In general, this approach allows lower compression forces to be used in the main compression step, which in turn places less stress on the press. In addition, this approach also allows for reduced compression dwell times, as compared to the extended dwell times generally associated with lower compression forces, which enables faster press operation. Finally, as indicated above, this approach also allows stronger tablets to be produced (for a given tablet density) than otherwise identical tablets made by a single-step compaction process. When using this approach, the pre-compression force is desirably at least about 5 kN (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm), or about a 10.6 MPa pre-compression pressure (for a 24.5 mm diameter tablet). A pre-compression force this low may require the use of a binder or a liquid flavor carrier with binder properties to provide tablets with acceptable friability and hardness at relatively high manufacture rates per die (as suggested by the data below, use of some binders or liquid flavor carriers with binder properties might also permit tablets made with a single compression to obtain acceptable friability and hardness at relatively high manufacture rates per die). Additionally, compressive forces on the order of ˜25 kN, ˜35 kN, ˜12 to ˜40 kN, ˜18 to ˜35 kN, or even ˜25 to ˜35 kN have been found suitable for this pre-compression step (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm). Thus, these pre-compressive forces will normally be ˜25 kN, ˜30 kN, or >˜12 kN, >˜17 kN, >˜18 kN, >˜20 kN, >˜25 kN, >˜35 kN and, in addition, generally <˜40 kN, <˜35 kN, or even <˜30 kN. Expressed as applied pressure during compaction (assuming a 24.5 mm tablet diameter), the corresponding pre-compressions would be ˜53.0 MPa (or N/mm 2 ), ˜63.6 MPa, or >˜25.5 MPa, >˜36.1 MPa, >˜38.2 MPa, >˜42.4 MPa, >˜53.0 MPa, >˜74.2 MPa and, in addition, generally <˜84.8 MPa, <˜74.2 MPa, or even <˜63.6 MPa. Expressed as a percentage of main compression force, pre-compressive forces of about 20-100%, 30-90%, 40-80%, or even 50-75% of main compression force have been found suitable for the pre-compression step (based on tablets having diameters of ˜24 mm to ˜25 mm). Thus, these pre-compressive forces will normally be >˜20%, >˜30%, or >˜40% and, in addition, generally <˜100%, <˜90%, or even <˜80% of the main compression force. Greater or lesser compressive forces can be used depending on the type, particle size and other properties of the ground roast coffee being processed, the desired density, strength and hardness of the coffee tablet being produced, and certain production variables as further discussed below, and can easily be determined by routine experimentation based on the teachings herein. In this regard, FIG. 1 shows the effect of altering the pre-compression force on the hardness, friability and extraction efficiency of the inventive ground roast coffee tablets obtained. This figure was developed from experiments in which a group of coffee tablets was produced by a two-step compaction process in which the tablet was first subjected to a pre-compression force ranging from ˜0.3 kN to ˜50 kN and thereafter subjected to a main compression force in the same compression die ranging from ˜10 to ˜70 kN. The data in FIG. 1 has been normalized to values observed with very low/no initial compression being taken as equal to 1. As shown in FIG. 1, when the pre-compression force used to make the inventive coffee tablets is varied between ˜20% to ˜100% of the main compression force, the hardness of the tablets produced increases by as much as 40% (at a pre-compression/main compression ratio of about 0.70), while the friability of the tablets produced is reduced by as much as 80% (at a pre-compression/main compression ratio of about 0.55). This makes it possible in accordance with this aspect of the invention to design the inventive coffee tablets having a predetermined combination of hardness and friability, as desired. As indicated above, one advantage of using the inventive multi-step compaction process for manufacturing the inventive coffee tablets, at least when this is done using a multiple station press, is that press operation is faster than would otherwise be the case if a single step compaction process were used. This is made possible because less compaction force can be used in the main or primary compaction step than would be required if compaction occurred in a single compaction step. In addition, using a multiple compaction steps allows the dwell time needed in the primary or main compactions step, i.e., the amount of time the ground roast coffee remains under compaction, to be less than that required if only a single compaction step were used. In this regard, see WO 2008/107342, which makes clear that in order to make a ground roast coffee tablet of sufficient strength using single step compaction (in which pre-compression is minimal or non-existent), the ground roast coffee must be compressed at a fairly slow rate (i.e., over the course of 0.1 to 2 seconds, preferably 0.2 to 0.8 seconds) and then held at its final volume for an additional significant period of time (i.e., for 0.2 to 5 second, preferably 0.3 to 2 seconds, and even more preferably 0.5 to 1.5 seconds). In contrast, the inventive process described herein uses a multi-step compaction approach that does not employ slow compression and an extended dwell time at final volume. In accordance with this invention, it has been found that pre-compression “prepares” the ground coffee for final compaction in such a way that less compaction pressure for a shorter period of time is necessary to produce a fully compacted tablet. This pre-compression preparation of the ground coffee, combined with a desired main compaction of the coffee tablet, as provided for in the production of the inventive coffee tablets, is believed to strike a balance between a number of factors believed to have an impact on the physical properties and the brew performance of the tablets, including, for example, tablet strength/robustness, tablet density, table porosity (including the degree of hydrophobicity, the diameter, the length, and/or the orientation of channels and passages on the surface of and within the body of tablet), particle sizes of the coffee from which the tablets are composed, water permeability, and water vapor permeability. When brewed in certain coffee makers where the tablets are exposed to steam during the brewing process (e.g.: automatic drip coffee makers), the water vapor permeability is believed to play a significant role in brew performance. Thus, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the inventive multi-step compaction process is carried out in such a way that the dwell time of the ground roasted coffee in the main compaction step, i.e., the period of time in which the coffee is under active compression in the main compaction step, is ≦˜0.3 second, ≦˜0.25 second, ≦˜0.2 second, ≦˜0.15 second, or even ≦˜0.1 second. Indeed, dwell times on the order of ≦75 milliseconds, ≦50 milliseconds, ≦25 milliseconds, ≦20 milliseconds, and even ≦15 milliseconds are contemplated and shown in the following working examples. For an exemplary rotary tablet press, the pre-compression and main compression dwell times may be determined from a known rotational speed of the rotary press and the fraction of the die revolution for which the head flat (i.e. the portion of the tool that contacts the compression roller, ramp, or cam) is held for pre-compression or compression by the compression roller, ramp, or cam. Where the compression location on the rotary press is limited to a discrete, instantaneous location (as is the case with tools impacted by compression rollers), this fraction of the die revolution is approximately equal to the tool head diameter divided by the die circle circumference. Thus, dwell time (in milliseconds) in such applications may be calculated as: [(Head Flat Diameter)/(2π×(Radius of rotary press die circle))]×[(60,000 ms/min)/(RPM)]. As one example, a 29-station rotary press with a die circle diameter of 410 mm and a head flat diameter of 15.52 mm can produce 90,000 tablets per hour using an operating speed of approximately 51.7 rpm, resulting in pre-compression and main compression dwell times of approximately 14 ms each. Because this dwell time is the rate limiting step in the operation of multi-station presses, press operation can be much faster when the inventive multi-step compaction process is used. Thus, commercially-available multi-stage tabletting presses can be operated at machine speeds capable of producing ≧50,000, ≧75,000, ≧100,000, and even ≧125,000, inventive coffee tablets per hour using the inventive processes. Because different machines may have two or more distinct production lines (two or more main compression steps), which may differ from machine to machine, it may be helpful to set forth production rates in terms of a number of tablets per set of compressions per die per hour (e.g., for the pre-compression/main compression examples, the set of compressions would include both compressions). Using the inventive processes to manufacture the inventive tablets herein, production rates of >1000 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >1500 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2000 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2400 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2500 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >2750 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; and >3000 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour are possible, and even production rates of >3100 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; >3450 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; and >3500 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour are possible. Tabletting presses capable of carrying out multi-stage compaction at these compaction pressures, dwell times, and production rates are available from a number of different commercial sources including Fette®, Korsch®, and possibly Courtoy® and Manesty®. In accordance with still another feature of this invention, it has been further found that the inventive coffee tablets, because of the way they are made, achieve a greater total extraction of coffee solids during brewing as compared to an otherwise identical conventional ground roast coffee composition (i.e., the same untabletted ground roast coffee). That is to say, the total amount of coffee solids extracted and recovered in the brewed coffee product obtained is greater when the inventive coffee tablets are used in a typical ADC coffee maker than when the same amount of conventional (untabletted) ground roast coffee is used in the same coffee maker. This feature is illustrated in the following working examples which show that the yield ratios provided by the inventive coffee tablets, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the inventive coffee tablets relative to the coffee solids recovered from brewing a substantially equal amount of untabletted (but otherwise identical) ground roast coffee, are normally >1 and in many instances >1.1, >1.15, and even >1.2 on a weight basis. Moreover, this is so even when the yield of coffee solids, i.e., the ratio of the coffee solids recovered from brewing the inventive coffee tablets relative to the amount of coffee present in the coffee tablets before brewing (i.e., [grams of coffee solids extracted from the brewed coffee]/[grams of coffee placed in the brew basket to brew the coffee]×[100]), is >26%, >28.5%, or even >30%. Still another feature of this invention is that an enhanced extraction efficiency (as evidenced, for example, by increased absorbance, absorbance per gram, yield, and percent brew solids) exhibited by the inventive coffee tablets, as described herein, is essentially independent of the magnitude of the pre-compression force used in the pre-compression step of the inventive manufacturing process. This is illustrated in FIG. 1, which further shows that the brew solids (i.e., amount of coffee solids recovered in the brewed coffee product) remains essentially unaffected as the magnitude of the pre-compression force is varied. (When using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, brew solids of 0.36-1.3% or 0.5-1% or 0.42-1.5% or 0.5-0.9% or 0.50-0.75% are of interest.) Because of this feature, the hardness and friability of the inventive coffee tablets can be suitably selected, as discussed above, without compromising this enhanced brewing efficiency. Another way to determine the amount of coffee solids that are extracted during brewing is to measure the coffee brew's absorbance. The absorbance is, in effect, a measure of the darkness of a coffee brew. A spectrophotometer is used to measure the amount of light absorbance by the liquid brewed coffee at a wavelength of 480 nanometers (nm). A wavelength of 480 nm has been chosen because it corresponds with an absorption feature in the visible spectrum that is associated with the brown color of coffee brews (i.e., the Brown Color absorbance). Stronger coffee brews typically exhibit a bore prominent Brown Color absorbance. Thus, the absorbance value taken at 480 nm correlates with the visually perceived darkness of a cup of coffee. In practice, for example, a sample of brewed coffee is placed in an 8 ml sealed vial and cooled for 15 minutes at room temperature; the sample is then transferred to a cuvette and the absorbance is measured in a Genesys 10 Spectrophotometer at 480 nm wavelength. Absorbance values>1.1, >1.25, and >1.7 and <3.5, <2.5, and <1.75 are of interest. From this base measure of the brewed coffee absorbance, several other values are of interest, including: absorbance ratio (absorbance of brew from tablets/absorbance of brew of the same untabletted ground roast coffee); absorbance per gram (absorbance/grams of coffee put in brew basket) (e.g., at a 10 tablet basis); and absorbance/gram ratio: (Absorbance/gram tablets)/(Absorbance/gram of the same untabletted ground roast coffee). Absorbance ratios>1, >1.06, and >1.12 are of interest. Absorbance per gram values>0.06, >0.07, and >0.09 are of interest. Absorbance per gram ratios>1.05, >1.15, and >1.2 are of interest. Brew Dynamics In accordance with still another aspect of this invention, it has further been found that the inventive coffee tablets, which, because of the way they are made, may have a modified time dependency associated with their brew performance over the course of brewing cycle (also referred to as “brew dynamics”). For example, over the duration of a brew cycle, the instantaneous concentration of coffee solids extracted (herein referred to as “instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration”) for a particular chronological portion of the brew (for example, one or more aliquots forming an initial, a middle, or an end portion of the brew) may be altered, as compared to the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration for the same portion formed from one or more aliquots taken from a brew made using untabletted coffee in roasted and ground form. As described herein, an “instantaneous” measure of brew dynamics (e.g., instantaneous concentration, instantaneous absorbance, or instantaneous brew delivery) describes the characteristics of one of a series of incremental or sequential samples or aliquots taken contemporaneously with the brewing process, such as, for example, one of a series of 20 second timed aliquots of the brew. Thus, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration associated with an initial portion of a brew produced using the inventive coffee tablets may be lower than the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration for an initial portion of a brew produced using the corresponding untabletted coffee. The extent to which the concentration of solids will be lower may depend, for example, on the wettability of the compacted coffee tablet and the rate at which the coffee tablet is broken up during brewing. Expressed in terms of the mass of the total brew, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the mass of the initial portion is approximately 200-300 g taken from a total brew mass of 1330 g. Expressed in terms of the total brewing period, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, this initial portion is removed, approximately, during the initial 100-150 seconds of a 630 second total brew period (as timed from initial extraction). Additionally or alternatively, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration associated with a middle portion (collected in one or more aliquots) of a brew (e.g., during a period immediately following the period associated with the initial portion) produced using the inventive coffee tablets may be greater than the instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration for a middle portion of a brew produced using the corresponding untabletted coffee. The extent to which the concentration of solids will be higher with the inventive coffee tablets may depend, for example, on an increased extractability be associated with or resulting from the disruption of cellular particles within the coffee tablets. Expressed in terms of the mass of the total brew, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the mass of the middle portion is approximately 200-300 g taken immediately following the initial 200-300 g associated with the initial portion, from a total brew mass of 1330 g. Expressed in terms of the total brewing period, in one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, this middle portion is removed, approximately, during the 80-130 seconds, immediately following the 100-150 seconds in which the initial portion is taken, of a 630 second total brew period (as timed from initial extraction). A reduced instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration exhibited in the initial aliquot, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as the amount of coffee solids extracted during the initial brew period, as a percentage of the total extracted coffee solids during the entire brew. In one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the coffee solids extracted during the first 200 g of a 1330 g brew is approximately 5-15% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew, and may, for example, be approximately 5-11% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew (as compared to approximately 30-60% solids extraction for a corresponding roast and ground coffee). An increased instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration exhibited in the middle portion, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as the amount of coffee solids extracted during the mid-range brew period (during which the one or more aliquots taken to form the middle portion of the brew are collected), as a percentage of the total extracted coffee solids during the entire brew. In one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the coffee solids extracted during the 250 g after the first 250 g of a 1330 g brew is approximately 35-50% of the total extracted coffee solids during the entire brew, and may, for example, be approximately 40-50% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew (as compared to approximately 20-40% solids extraction for a corresponding roast and ground coffee). In another example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the coffee solids extracted during the 200 g after the first 300 g of a 1330 g brew is approximately 33-40% of the total coffee solids extracted during the entire brew (as compared to approximately 15-27% solids extraction for a corresponding roast and ground coffee). A reduced instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration measured during an initial brew period, followed by an increased instantaneous extracted coffee solids concentration measured during a subsequent mid-range brew period, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the initial brew period divided by the total coffee solids extracted during the mid-range brew period (or vice versa). As one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the first 250 g of a 1330 g brew to the total coffee solids extracted during the next 250 g of the brew is approximately 0.3-0.65 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 2-5). As another example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the first 200 g of a 1330 g brew to the total coffee solids extracted during the 200 g after the first 300 g of the brew is approximately 0.18-0.31 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 1.4-3.5). As still another example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the total coffee solids extracted during the first 200 g of a 1330 g brew to the total coffee solids extracted during the 250 g after the first 250 g of the brew is approximately 0.14-0.25 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 1.0-2.2). Further, the brew dynamics of the inventive tabletted coffee product may be such that after some intermediate point in the brewing process (e.g., after an initial approximately 600-850 g of a 1330 g brew) using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, the cumulative mass of coffee solids extracted exceeds the cumulative mass of coffee solids extracted from brewing the same untabletted coffee in roasted and ground form at a corresponding point in its brewing process. In one such example, this intermediate point is approximately 300-360 seconds into a 630-second total brewing period. Additionally or alternatively, the inventive coffee tablets, when brewed, may result in absorbance during an initial portion of the brew that is lower than that produced during the same initial portion of a brew when brewing the corresponding untabletted coffee. A reduced absorbance during an initial brew period, followed by an increased absorbance during a subsequent mid-range brew period, as provided by certain ones of the inventive coffee tablets, may be expressed as a ratio of the absorbance of the brew during the initial brew period divided by the absorbance of the brew during the mid-range brew period (or vice versa). As one example using an automatic drip coffee maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.5-3.1 g/sec, a ratio of the absorbance during the first 250 g of a 1330 g brew to the absorbance during the next 250 g of the brew is approximately 0.3-0.6 (as compared to a corresponding roast and ground coffee ratio of approximately 1.5-2.5). Instant Coffee In accordance with another aspect of this invention, it has been found that instant coffee when included in the inventive coffee tablets in small but suitable amounts acts as a binder, a disintegration aid and a brewing aid. Coffee tablets formed entirely from instant coffee have been made but such products typically do not have the desired flavor and aroma characteristics of conventional ground roast coffee. Instant coffee, however, can be mixed with ground roast coffee at low levels and tabletted in accordance with the teachings herein. The amount of instant coffee that may be included in the inventive ground roast coffee tablets in accordance with this aspect of the invention should be enough to achieve a noticeable improvement in at least one of the properties indicated above, i.e., binding strength, ease of disintegration and/or brewing efficiency, without unduly altering the flavor of the coffee brew produced. In general, this means that the amount of instant coffee included will normally be ≧˜0.5 wt. %, ≧˜1 wt. % or ≧˜3 wt. %, based on the total amount of coffee solids in the tablet (i.e., the total amount of ground roast coffee, decaffeinated ground roast coffee and instant coffee). In addition, this also means that the amount of instant coffee included will normally be ≦˜15 wt. %, more typically ≦˜10 wt. %, or ≦˜6 wt. %, ≦˜5 wt. % or even ≦˜4 wt. %, based on the total amount of coffee solids in the tablet (i.e., the total amount of ground roast coffee, decaffeinated ground roast coffee and instant coffee). Embodiments in which the inventive coffee tablets contain up to 20 wt. % or even 30 wt. % instant coffee are contemplated. The presence of instant coffee in coffee tablets can be detected by a number of different methods. The process of making instant coffee changes the composition of the coffee. One compositional change that occurs is a change in the concentration of low molecular weight carbohydrates that are present. Compounds that tend to be increased in instant coffees are monosaccharides, especially the monosaccharides mannose, arabinose, and galactose. These may be measured by a variety of methods. However, one method is described in R. M. Noyes and C. M. Chu, “Material Balance on Free Sugars in the Production of Instant Coffee”, ASIC, 15 th Colloque, Montpellier, 1993, which is incorporated herein by reference. These three compounds increase in instant coffee compared to roast ground coffee. Galactose is especially interesting because previous reports have indicated that galactose is not present in roast ground coffee. The other monosaccharides may be present in ground roast coffee, but it is believed that they are present at much lower levels than they are in instant coffee. These differences in the amount of low molecular weight carbohydrates present in tablets made from mixtures of roast ground coffee and instant coffee do not affect the flavor of the coffee brew produced, as long as the weight percent of instant coffee present in the tablets is kept within the ranges described herein. Interesting levels of these specific carbohydrates in certain embodiments of the coffee tablets include: galactose in an amount>0.0005 wt. %, or >0.001 wt. %, or >0.003 wt. %; galactose in an amount<0.012 wt. %, or <0.02 wt. %, or <0.03 wt. %; arabinose in an amount>0.0045 wt. %, or >0.005 wt. %, or >0.0075; arabinose in an amount<0.04 wt. %, or <0.07 wt. %, or <0.1 wt. %; mannose in an amount>0.007 wt. %, or >0.0075 wt. %, or >0.008 wt. %; and mannose in an amount<0.03 wt. %, or <0.04 wt. %, or <0.06 wt. %. These may be determined using a gas chromatograph as follows: samples are freeze dried to remove water prior to the analysis; samples are processed with dimethyl sulfoxide to solubilize the sugars and the solution is silated with tri-sil concentrate, which causes the free sugars to form a volatile complex which is analyzed by direct injection into a gas chromatograph. The percent relative standard deviation for this method has been determined to be 2.52% for mannitol and 1.49% for total free sugars. Additionally, although not tested, the differences in visible appearance and the hygroscopic nature of instant coffee might permit the presence of instant coffee in a coffee tablet to be detected by a visual inspection, especially if observed under a microscope. For example, the addition of small amounts of steam to roast ground coffee will not greatly affect the roast ground coffee appearance (perhaps it will darken). In contrast, instant coffee is known to absorb steam and may appear to liquefy and perhaps “melt.” This visual effect will likely be more pronounced if the tablets being tested are broken up before being steamed and viewed under a microscope. In addition, the visual inspection of a tablet under a microscope without steaming might permit a determination that instant coffee is present in the coffee tablet. This is because instant coffee is known to have a very different appearance than ground roast coffee. This different appearance may or may not be easy to detect with tablets formed from both ground roast coffee and instant coffee, as the tabletting process may change the size of the particles making the difference between instant coffee particles and ground roast coffee particles harder to see. Drying the Coffee Beans Before Roasting Another interesting aspect of this invention relates to controlling the size and properties of the inventive ground roast coffee tablets by low-moisture drying of the coffee beans that are used to make the ground roast coffee from which these inventive ground roast coffee tablets are subsequently made, i.e., by drying these coffee beans to a moisture content below the 12% level of conventional coffee beans prior to roasting. In particular, it is possible to reduce the friability of these tablets by a factor of as much as 2, 4, 6, 10 and even 100 by drying the coffee beans in this manner. Also, corresponding reductions in tablet volume can be achieved, which are on the order of 10%, 20% and even 30% as compared to the volume of an otherwise identical tablet made from conventionally dried coffee beans. In accordance with this aspect of the invention, coffee beans are further dried before roasting from a conventional moisture content of ˜12% to a moisture content of ≦10%, ≦8%, ≦7%, ≦6%, or even ≦5%. Thus low-moisture drying the beans to a moisture content of ˜0.5 to ˜10%, ˜2% to ˜7%, ˜2% to ˜6%, ˜3% to ˜6%, or even ˜3% to ˜5%, is contemplated. This additional drying may take place at the end of the standard drying or may be added as an additional drying step prior to roasting. However, in either case, the moisture should be reduced prior to roasting. This additional or low moisture drying can occur at any suitable set of conditions in one or more additional drying steps and is conveniently done by heating the coffee beans at from 70° to 325° F. (21° to 163° C.), or ˜70° F. to ˜300° F., ˜120° F. to ˜275° F., or even ˜160° F. to ˜250° F. over drying times lasting ˜1 minute to ˜24 hours, ˜30 minutes to ˜24 hours, ˜1 hour to ˜24 hours, ˜1 hour to ˜12 hours, ˜1 hour to ˜6 hours, or even ˜2 hours to ˜6 hours. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,703 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,160,757, which describe methods for low-moisture drying coffee beans prior to roasting. The disclosures of both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. After moisture reduction in accordance with this aspect of the invention, the low-moisture beans obtained can then be roasted by any conventional technique, as discussed above. For example, the low-moisture dried beans can be charged into a bubbling bed or fluidized bed roaster where they contact a hot air stream at inlet air temperature of from ˜350° to ˜1200° F. (˜177° C. to ˜649° C.) preferably from ˜400° F. to ˜800° F. (˜204° C. to ˜427° C.), at roast times from ˜10 seconds to not longer than ˜5.5 minutes, preferably from ˜10 to ˜47 seconds. The low-moisture dried coffees may be used alone or in mixtures with other coffee beans, both low-moisture dried and conventionally dried. Flavorants Flavorants, both liquid and solid, can be included in the inventive coffee tablets in conventional amounts. Exemplary flavorants include French vanilla, hazelnut, amaretto, cappuccino, chocolate, mint, peppermint, cinnamon, vanilla, caramel, maple, toffee, pumpkin, spices, Irish Cream, Kahlua®, Crème Brulee, and nut flavors such as almond and macadamia nut, and so forth. A number of difficulties may arise when flavorants are added to coffee products. First, flavorants are normally added at a standardized level rather than at levels specifically targeted to a type of consumer. Consequently, all consumers get the same relative amount of flavor, whether or not they prefer a higher or lower flavor intensity. Second, flavorants may segregate during shipping and handling, so that the concentration of flavoring may vary through the mass of the coffee product (for example, low at the top of the canister and high at the bottom of the canister). Third, the timing associated with when the aroma of the flavorant is released during the brewing cycle is difficult to control, even though generating different aromas at different times in the brew cycle may be desirable. In accordance with another aspect of this invention, these problems are largely eliminated by including flavorants in the inventive coffee tablets. For example, since all the ingredients of the inventive coffee tablets have been compacted together, segregation of flavorants is largely eliminated. Additionally, the dry flavorant in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,185 also helps prevent segregation in the in-feed to the equipment, as described in that patent. Moreover, because the inventive coffee tablets can be formulated with different flavorants, and with different amounts of flavorants, the desired flavor and intensity of a brewed coffee can be easily customized to taste, by appropriately selecting and combining different amounts of different flavored coffee tablets to use in the brewing cycle. Moreover, since the coffee tablets can be produced with the flavorants located in different portions throughout the inventive coffee tablets (e.g., in the middle, on the surface, in between the two), the timing associated with when the aroma is released in the brew cycle can also be selected and controlled. As appreciated by coffee professionals, coffee flavorants are normally added to coffee products by means of flavor carriers that are provided to make dispensing, metering and mixing of the flavorant with the coffee product easier. Moreover, these carrier-containing flavorant compositions can be in dry, liquid, or paste forms. In accordance with this invention, some flavor carriers have surprisingly been found to act like binders in coffee tablets. Encapsulated flavorants such as those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,185, can also be used. The entire disclosure of this patent is incorporated herein by reference. In this regard, it has been further found, in accordance with this aspect of the invention, that by adding flavorants to the inventive coffee tablets using the solid carriers described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,841,185, stronger tablets which generate a greater yield of coffee solids in the brewed coffee product are obtained, as compared with tablets which do not contain flavorant. Use of a dry flavorant in formulating the inventive coffee tablets has a number of benefits. Mixing a dry flavorant with a dry coffee composition ensures that the flavor is uniformly distributed within the coffee prior to tabletting. In addition, using a dry flavor compositions allows tablets to be made in which some of the flavor can be incorporated into a separate dry layer residing on one or more surfaces, or in the middle of the tablet. It is also possible to have some of the flavor mixed in with the ground roast coffee and a second portion of the flavorant residing on the surface of the tablet or arranged in a multi-layer arrangement with other flavor layers. This not only provides an interesting visual signal to the consumer that a flavorant or flavorants are present, but it also allows for a time release characteristic associated with the release of the aroma of the flavorant to be incorporated into the tablet. For example, a first flavor layer may be placed on the outside of the tablet to release a first aroma of the first flavorant, and a second flavor layer may be placed in the inside of the tablet to release a second aroma of the second flavorant later. The first and second flavorants may have the same or different flavors and aromas. This same effect can also be achieved with flavor “bits” which can be mixed in with the coffee and/or adhered to the surface. Normally, the dry flavorants used in making the inventive coffee tablets will have a moisture content in the range of ˜1% to ˜7%, a particle density in the range of ˜0.1 g/cc to ˜0.8 g/cc, and a mean particle size distribution in the range of ˜5 microns to ˜150 microns, although dry flavorants with moisture contents, particle densities, and mean particle size distributions outside these ranges can also be used. The ratio of coffee component particle size to flavor component particle size is generally in the range of from ˜100:1 to ˜5:1. When dry flavorants are used in making the inventive coffee tablets (including wet flavorants encapsulated in dry flavor carriers), they are typically present in the amount of ˜0.5% to ˜20% of flavorant, or ˜2% to ˜15%, more preferably from ˜3% to ˜10%, ˜4% to ˜8%, on a on a dry weight basis. When liquid or paste flavorants are used in making the inventive coffee tablets, they are typically present in the amount of ˜0.5% to ˜20% of flavorant, or ˜1.5% to ˜15% or ˜2% to ˜12%, more preferably from ˜3% to ˜10%, or even ˜3% to ˜8%. WORKING EXAMPLES In order to more thoroughly describe this invention, the following working examples are presented. In all of the working examples below, percent brew solids was calculated using a recognized correlation between the percent brew solids of the brewed coffee product and the refractive index of the brewed coffee product, with percent brew solids being calculated as (549.209×RI)−731.575 (at a temperature basis of 29° C.). The total brew solids was then determined by multiplying the percent brew solids by the mass of brewed coffee product, and the percent yield was calculated by dividing the total extracted brew solids by the total mass of coffee placed in the brewer (multiplied by 100). In the working examples presented in co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/168,027, filed on Apr. 9, 2009 and entitled GROUND ROAST COFFEE TABLET (the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference), the calculated correlation between refractive index and percent brew solids differed from the above correlation, as percent brew solids was calculated as (560.224×RI)−746.216 (at a temperature basis of 20° C.). Additionally, the zero point measurement for refractive index was measured at 1.33200, and has since been adjusted to 1.33204. As a result, due to changes to the temperature basis (from 20° C. to 29° C.) and the zero point measurement for refractive index, the calculated percent brew solids, total brew solids, and percent yield in the earlier working examples were approximately 15% greater than the corresponding calculated values determined and presented herein. For the working examples that have been re-presented in the present application, the percent brew solids, total brew solids, and percent yield have been adjusted to correspond to the newly adopted correlations and measurements (i.e., based on percent brew solids=(549.209×RI)−731.575, and RI zero point=1.33204). Example 1 Pre-Compression Brazilian arabica coffee beans were roasted and ground. This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of 17.9, a bulk density of 0.294 g/cm 3 and a mean particle size of 885 microns. The ground roast coffee so made was formed into cylindrical tablets containing ˜2.65 gms ground roast coffee (moisture content 4.75%) and having a diameter of about 24 to 24.5 mm by means of a Fette Model 2200SE multiple station tabletting machine operating at a rate of 90,000 tablets per hour (over 3000 tablets per hour per station and a dwell time of ˜14 millisecond) under different conditions in which the compaction force in the main or primary compactions step was held constant but the compaction force in pre-compression step was varied. The hardness of the tablets so made was determined using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode, while the friability of the tablets obtained using a Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber drum by rotating 25 grams of the tablets in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these tablets that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. Multiple tablets were tested for each batch of tablets made. The tablets so formed were then brewed into brewed coffee with Mr. Coffee® Model DR13 coffee makers, having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.75 g/sec, using 10 tablets (˜26.5 gms) and 1420 ml of water for each batch of brewed coffee brewed. For comparison purposed, a control experiment was run in the same way but using 29.5 gms conventional coffee, i.e., ground roast coffee in untabletted form. The Yield was calculated based on the grams of coffee solids recovered in the in the brewed coffee (as determined by the mass and % brew solids in this brewed coffee product). Meanwhile, the Yield ratio was determined by comparing the Yield of coffee solids obtained when using inventive coffee tablets in comparison with the yield of coffee solids obtained in a control experiment in which untabletted coffee was used. The absorbance was measured by placing a sample of the brewed coffee in an 8 ml sealed vial, cooling the sample for 15 minutes at room temperature; transferring the sample to a cuvette and measuring the absorbance in a Genesys 10 Spectrophotometer at 480 nm wavelength. The absorbance per gram was calculated by dividing the absorbance by the total mass of the coffee tablets used in the brew. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 1: TABLE 1 Example 1—Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorbance Abs/gram 4.9 39.6 2.62 18 33.1 0.90 29.8 1.22 1.808 0.069 20 39.7 2.68 2.5 50.8 0.96 30.1 1.23 1.763 0.066 29.7 39.7 2.66 6.1 45.0 0.96 27.6 1.13 1.750 0.065 37.6 39.7 2.63 4.5 46.5 0.95 29.6 1.21 1.821 0.069 As can be seen from this table, increasing the force used in the pre-compression step increases the hardness and reduces the friability of the tablets obtained without adversely the yield of the coffee solids contained in the finish coffee obtained. Note, also, that the tablets with better hardness/friability profiles had densities of 0.95 g/cm 3 or greater. In addition, the ratio between the compression forces used in the pre-compression and main compression steps ranged from ˜50% to ˜95%. Finally, also note that the yield ratio was greater than 1 for each experiment in this example, thereby indicating that the amount of coffee solids extracted from a given amount of ground roast coffee is significantly greater when that coffee is formulated into coffee tablets in accordance with this invention rather than being used in a conventional (untabletted) form. Example 2 Pre-Compression Example 1 was repeated using a coffee comprising a mixture of arabica and robusta coffee beans. The ground roast coffee so made had a bulk density of 0.28 g/cm 3 prior to compaction with a mean particle size of 720 microns. The tablets had a moisture content of about 4.7%. Tablet mass was about 2.45 grams and 10 tablets were brewed. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 2: TABLE 2 Example 2—Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorb Abs/g 5 50 2.44 20.7 30 0.89 29.4 1.16 1.935 0.080 19.9 49.9 2.40 2.0 47.1 0.97 29.6 1.17 1.904 0.079 20.5 51 2.46 2.4 46.7 0.97 29.3 1.16 1.938 0.079 30.3 50.6 2.46 6.1 46.4 0.98 28.5 1.13 1.951 0.079 40.2 50.2 2.45 6.6 40.8 0.98 28.2 1.11 1.939 0.080 As can be seen from Table 2, increasing the ratio of the forces used in the pre-compression and main compression steps dramatically reduced friability, while increasing hardness. As in Example 1, the Yield Ratio for each experiment in this example also significantly exceeded 1, thereby further demonstrating that more coffee solids are extracted from the inventive tablets than are extracted from an equivalent amount of ground roast coffee in untabletted form. Note also that the best products (i.e., tablets having the highest hardnesses and lowest friabilities) had densities of 0.97 to 0.98 g/cm 3 and that the ratio of pre-compression to main compression forces ranged from ˜40% to ˜80%. Example 3 Pre-Compression Examples 1 and 2 were repeated, except that a different blend of arabica and robusta coffees was used, the ground roast coffee produced having a density of 0.33 g/cm 3 and a mean particle size of 806 microns was used. The tablets were about 3 grams in mass with a moisture content of about 5.2%. For brewing, 29.9 to 30.5 grams of tablets were used while 33.32 grams of ground roast coffee was used in the control experiment. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 3: TABLE 3 Example 3—Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorb Abs/g 0.4 40 2.96 12.7 41.8 0.91 31.1 1.22 2.109 0.071 5.4 40.3 3.05 12.2 43.1 0.93 32.7 1.29 2.108 0.070 20.3 40.3 3.05 4.2 54.9 0.96 32.0 1.26 2.223 0.073 30.2 40.9 2.99 4.9 57 0.95 28.7 1.13 2.135 0.071 38.1 40.7 3.00 5.8 58.8 0.97 28.6 1.12 2.200 0.073 As can be seen from Table 3, a large drop in friability was observed when the ratio of the force used in the pre-compression step to the main compression step increased to ˜0.14:1 (14%) or more. The densities of these low friability products exceeded 0.95 g/cm 3 , even though the yield ratio was maintained well above 1. Example 4 Pre-Compression Example 3 was repeated using a higher force for the main compression step. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 4: TABLE 4 Example 4—Test Conditions and Results Initial Final Tablet Comp, Comp, Mass, % Hardness, density, % Yield kN kN g Friability N g/cm 3 Yield Ratio Absorb Abs/g 5.4 50.6 2.98 17.4 45.1 0.96 30.1 1.18 2.273 0.076 19.9 50.8 2.99 4.2 56.1 0.98 30.2 1.18 2.214 0.074 29.8 50.5 3.02 3.6 59.6 0.99 28.6 1.12 2.174 0.072 40.8 50.1 2.99 8.3 63.0 1.01 32.1 1.26 2.184 0.073 Again, a dramatic drop in friability and an increase in hardness was observed. In this case, all products had densities greater than 0.96, without adversely affecting yield, while the ratio of pre-compression to main compression forces ranged from ˜37% to ˜82% in the tablets exhibiting good friability. It should be noted that going to higher final compression alone did not yield an improved friability, hardness, or yield. Example 5 Addition of Instant Coffee Coffee A was prepared from a mixture of ground roast arabica and robusta coffees. Coffee B was prepared by forming a blend comprising 95.2 wt. % of Coffee A and 4.8 wt. % of commercially-available Folgers® brand instant coffee. Coffees A and B were each made into tablets weighing about 3 grams each using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using seven different operating conditions. These conditions were some combination of changes in operating speed (rpm), pre-compression force, and/or main compression force. After compression, 10 tablets were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. After brewing, the percent of solids extracted into the brew was measured by refractive index, which was then converted into total solids extracted. The yield of the roast and ground (“R&G”) coffee was calculated based on amount of solids extracted divided by weight of coffee put into the brewer. The yield of coffee solids extracted from the ground roast coffee portions of the respective “Coffee B's” was determined by assuming 100% extraction of the instant coffee and subtracting the mass of the instant coffee from the total solids extracted. The following results were obtained: TABLE 5 Example 5—Test Conditions and Results Tablet % Solids R&G Tablet Tablet Volume at Mass, Brew in Brew, extracted, R&G Vol. same Brew Solids Coffee Run g Solids g g Yield cm 3 cm 3 A 1 3.17 0.65 8.58 8.58 0.27 3.17 3.17 B 1 3.08 0.82 10.72 9.24 0.32 3.11 2.47 A 2 3.05 0.62 8.13 8.13 0.27 3.09 3.09 B 2 2.98 0.80 10.59 9.16 0.32 2.98 2.32 A 3 3.06 0.64 8.46 8.46 0.28 3.18 3.18 B 3 3.07 0.82 10.84 9.37 0.32 3.16 2.48 A 4 2.98 0.60 7.89 7.89 0.26 3.06 3.06 B 4 3.0 0.71 9.40 7.96 0.28 3.05 2.58 A 5 3.0 0.60 7.96 7.96 0.27 3.03 3.03 B 5 3.01 0.71 9.40 7.96 0.28 2.95 2.57 A 6 2.9 0.55 7.33 7.33 0.25 3.01 3.01 B 6 3.0 0.93 12.23 10.79 0.38 3.1 1.85 A 7 2.94 0.76 10.09 10.09 0.34 2.93 2.93 B 7 3.04 0.79 10.40 8.94 0.31 3.01 2.92 Mean 3.01 0.63 8.35 8.35 0.28 3.06 3.06 of A Mean 3.03 0.80 10.51 9.06 0.32 3.05 2.42 of B Ratio 1.26 1.14 0.79 In the table above, the conversion from % Brew Solids to Solids in Brew was based on an assumption that 1320 ml of liquid brew was obtained for all products. This is a reasonable value for what one would expect to come out of a brew basket based on using 1420 mls of water going into the brew. (This is different from what was done in examples 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 where the actual amount of liquid brew was measured and used.) As can be seen, the addition of the instant coffee not only gave higher overall brew solids, but also increased the yield of the coffee solids extracted from the ground roast (R&G) coffee used. That is to say, more coffee solids was extracted from a given amount of ground roast coffee when instant coffee was also included in the inventive coffee tablets as compared to essentially identical coffee tablets not containing instant coffee. The last column on the right of Table 1 shows a calculated tablet size that would be obtained if the tablets made from Coffee B were resized to give the same overall extraction yield as the tablets made from Coffee A. As can be seen, the resized tablets made from Coffee B would be 20% smaller than the tablets made only from Coffee A. Example 6 Addition of Instant Coffee Additional data was collected from the same runs disclosed above in Example 5. This additional data is shown in Table 6 below as well as attached FIG. 2 in which the labels for each data point gives the fill volume for the die. TABLE 6 Example 6—Test Conditions and Results Coffee Run RPM Fill Volume Tablet Mass Fill Density A 1 17.47 9.12 3.17 0.348 B 1 17.24 8.23 3.08 0.374 A 2 17.47 9.12 3.05 0.334 B 2 17.24 8.23 3.0 0.365 A 3 34.48 9.12 3.06 0.336 B 3 34.48 8.45 3.07 0.363 A 4 34.48 9.12 2.98 0.327 B 4 34.48 8.45 2.99 0.354 A 5 34.48 9.12 3.00 0.329 B 5 34.48 8.45 3.01 0.356 A 6 51.72 9.565 2.90 0.303 B 6 50.63 9.12 3.00 0.329 A 7 51.72 9.565 2.94 0.307 B 7 50.63 9.12 3.04 0.333 Mean of A 9.247 3.014 0.326 Mean of B 8.579 3.027 0.353 Ratio 0.928 1.004 1.083 From Table 6 and FIG. 2, it can be seen that the fill volume for Coffee B was less than the fill volume for Coffee A for each run. Note, also, that the mass of Coffee A decreased, while that of Coffee B remained fairly constant. In addition, although the fill volume for Coffee A increased, it was always larger than the fill volume for Coffee B. Comparing especially the highest machine speed, the fill volume for Coffee B was 5% less than for Coffee A, yet the tablet mass was 4% higher. This shows that including instant coffee in the inventive ground roast coffee tablets allows a more efficient fill of the individual dies, and hence higher operating speeds of the machine, before machine capacity is limited by die filling. This effect, coupled with the lower mass made possible by including instant coffee, as described in Example 5, enables even higher machine operating speeds to be obtained. The operating speed of tabletting machines should not be increased so high that tablet mass decreases appreciably or varies unacceptably for a given ground roast coffee. If tablets are underweight relative to other tablets made from the same ground roast coffee, a consumer may be dissatisfied because brewing the tablets will result in too weak of a brew. Additionally, if the tablet mass varies too much for a given ground roast coffee, a consumer may be discouraged from using the tablets because the resulting brew differs too much from use to use. Example 7 Low-Moisture Drying of Coffee Beans Coffee A was made by roasting Mexican arabica coffee beans in a Neuhaus Neotec roaster for 3.3 minutes to an L-color of 12.2. Coffee B was made from the same Mexican arabica coffee beans, which were low-moisture dried to a moisture content of 5 wt. % before roasting, and then roasted in a Neuhaus Neotec roaster for 2.3 minutes to an L-color of 12.6. Both coffees were ground roast to a similar mean particle size (˜760 microns), with Coffee A exhibiting a moisture content of 4.9% and a density of 0.27 g/cm 3 while Coffee B exhibited a moisture content of 5.0% and a density of 0.22 g/cm 3 . Both coffees were then made into tablets having a nominal diameter of 23.8 mm using a Fette Model 2200 rotary tablet press operating at a pre-compression force of 35 kN, a main compression force of 40 kN and an operating speed of 17.2 rpm. The mass of the ground roast coffee fed to the machine was varied such that tablets made from Coffee A averaged 2.8 grams while those from coffee B averaged 2.0 grams. Tablet A had an average volume of 2.9 cm 3 while tablet B had an average volume of 2.0 cm 3 , a 30% reduction in volume. Friability was measured and was found to be 0.95% for Coffee A and 0.06% for Coffee B, which represents a reduction of over 90%, or by a factor of over 15. After production, tablets were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) automatic drip coffeemaker. Brewing was conducted with 10 cups of water. Total coffee used was 30.9 g for coffee A and 30.6 g for coffee B. After brewing the % brew solids in the brewed coffee made from coffee A was found to be 0.66 wt. %, while the % brew solids for the brewed coffee made from coffee B was found to be 0.64 wt. %. In addition, the yield for coffee A was found to be 28.4%, while the yield for coffee B was found to be 27.7%, even though coffee tablets B were ˜30% smaller. As can be seen from this experiment, although much smaller tablets were made in the case of Coffee B, the extraction of coffee solids from Coffee B was essentially the same as that for Coffee A. Moreover, the friability of the tablets made from Coffee B was lower than the friability of the tablets made from Coffee A.

Example 9 Low-Moisture Drying of Coffee Beans A regular roast, ground roast coffee was made using 55% arabica coffee beans and 45% robusta coffee beans. On average, the coffee beans were roasted to a Hunter L color of about 15.7 L over a roast period of about 3.2 minutes. All coffees were treated by typical processing to provide ground roast coffees have a typical particle size of approximately 825 microns and a typical density of about 0.33 g/cm 3 . A ground roast coffee was made from 10% regular ground roast arabica coffee, 40% regular ground roast robusta coffee, and 50% ground roast arabica coffee derived from coffee beans that had been low-moisture dried to a moisture content of about 5% to produce a ground roast coffee mixture comprising 60% arabica and 40% robusta coffees, the coffee mixture having a mean particle size of ˜635 microns and a density of ˜0.247 g/cm 3 . The roasted, ground roast coffees so made were formed into tablets in a similar manner to that of the above Examples 7 and 8 using various different operating conditions. The tablets so obtained were then used to brew brewed coffees in the same manner as described above in connection with Examples 7 and 8. The various conditions used and the results obtained are shown in the following Table 10.

In addition, a 9% reduction in tablet volume was also achieved relative to tablets made with the conventionally dried coffee beans. Roast and ground coffee from pre-dried green coffee that has not been quickly roasted to a dark enough color does not appear to provide improved friability (i.e., does not provide decreased friability) relative to non-pre-dried green coffee. For example, pre-dried coffee roasted to 18.8 L and then ground and tabletted did not show an improved friability vis-à-vis normal moisture beans or vis-à-vis a 50/50 mix of pre-dry and normal moisture green coffee. Example 10 Liquid Flavor Carrier Additional coffee tablets were made using the inventive multi-step compaction process in general accordance with Examples 1-4 in which the magnitude of the initial compression step as well as the speed of the press, as measured by dwell time in the main compression step were varied. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 15 (runs b and d are from Example 3): TABLE 15 Example 10-Set 1-Test Conditions and Results Dwell Initial Final Hard- Fria- Ktab/ Time, Compression, Compression, ness, bility, Run hr msec kN kN N % a 60 21.0 20.5 40.7 60.5 2.3 b 90 14.0 20.3 40.3 54.9 4.2 c 120 10.5 20 40.2 43.0 9.1 d 90 14.0 0.4 40 41.8 12.7 By comparing Runs b and d, which were carried out at the same production rate (90,000 tablets/hr with a dwell time of 14.0 milliseconds), it can be seen that (as in the case of Examples 1-4) the both hardness and friability are improved when the force encountered in the initial compression step was more than about 20% of the force encountered in the main or primary compression step in accordance with this invention. It will also be noted, however, that as the production rate of the inventive tablets increased (runs a through c), hardness and friability declined somewhat (although both were still better than the control, Run d). Another set of experiments similar to Set 1 above was run using a different coffee. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 16: TABLE 16 Example 10-Set 2-Test Conditions and Results Dwell Initial Final Hard- Fria- Ktab/ Time, Compression, Compression, ness, bility, Run hr msec kN kN N % e 90 14.0 30.7 49.6 56.3 4.7 f 120 10.5 29.9 49.2 43.4 9.0 g 130 9.7 30.8 49.8 42.1 11.8 Again, these results show the same trend as in the above Set 1, i.e., that as the production rate of the inventive tablets increased, hardness and friability declined somewhat. Still another set of experiments similar to Sets 1 and 2 above was run using the same coffee and conditions of Set 2, except that the inventive tablets contained 3 wt. % of a liquid flavor carrier comprising propylene glycol and triacetin. The results obtained are set forth in the following Table 17: TABLE 17 Example 10-Set 3-Test Conditions and Results Dwell Initial Final Hard- Fria- Ktab/ Time, Compression, Compression, ness, bility, Run hr msec kN kN N % h 90 14.0 30.7 49.5 79.2 0.9 i 120 10.5 29.2 49.4 71.8 1.5 j 130 9.7 29.2 50.3 74.5 2.1 These results show the same trend as in the above Sets 1 and 2, i.e., that as the production rate of the inventive tablets increased, hardness and friability declined somewhat. However, Table 17 shows that the magnitude of this effect is greatly reduced due to the presence of the liquid flavor carrier. Example 11 Liquid Flavor Carrier Brazilian coffee beans were roasted and ground. This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of 16.8 a bulk density of 0.31 g/cm 3 and a mean particle size of 890 microns. The roasted and ground coffee was separated into three batches. One batch was mixed with 3 wt. % propylene glycol (PG), based on the total weight of the composition obtained. A second batch was mixed 3 wt. % of a 90/10 w/w mixture of propylene glycol and triacetin (PG/TriA). No flavor carrier was added to the third batch, although it was mixed in a similar manner to the other batches. All mixing was done using a Forberg mixer. Each of the three batches were made into tablets using a Fette 2200 SE tabletting press at a variety of conditions. Hardness was measured immediately after production and again at least 6 days after production. Friability was measured at least 6 days after production. All tablets were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. Approximately 26 grams of tablets were brewed for each product. The % brew solids and the yield of coffee solids obtained in the final product were also determined. Nine different runs were made at different operating conditions, each run comparing the three different batches of tablets as described above. Table 18 below shows the mean values obtained for the hardness, friability, and brew yields obtained for each of these experiments. TABLE 18 Example 11- Set 1-Results Obtained Initial Final Hardness % Hardness, Hardness, Change, % Brew % Coffee N N N Fribilaity Solids Yield Absorbance Control 54.8 47.8 −7.0 7.8 0.72 35.1 1.88 Control + 77.6 79.8 2.2 1.1 0.8 39.2 2.1 propylene glycol Control 56.4 49.7 −6.7 6.3 0.73 35.3 1.88 Control + 69.8 71.5 1.7 1.9 0.78 37.8 2.15 liquid mixture As can be seen from Table 18, the addition of the liquid carrier gave increased hardness and lower friability without impairing brewing performance. Moreover, addition of the liquid carrier also prevented the tablets from experiencing the same small yet still significant decrease in hardness within their first week of manufacture shown by the Control tablets. Additionally, the liquid flavor carriers appear to be so effective that use of such liquid flavor carriers can make very low pre-compression forces viable at a high rate of manufacture (and perhaps will make no pre-compression tablets viable at high rates of manufacture). The following Table 19 shows examples of products made with low initial compression. They are not as good as tablets made with a higher initial compression; however, they may be commercially acceptable.

The flavor compound was intended to be used at a nominal 3% level (as discussed above in connection with the discussion of flavor carriers and flavorants). The coffee was turned into tablets in accordance with this invention using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press. Compression conditions used were pre-compression of 22 kN and a main compression of 35 kN in a rotary press having 29 stations with round dies of nominally 23.8 mm in diameter and operating at a speed of 25.9 rpm, thereby producing 45,000 tablets per hour (about 1550 tablets per set of compressions per die per hour; the other values herein for tablets per hour using the Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press can be converted to tablets per set of compressions per die per hour by dividing the hourly rate by 29 (there are 29 stations in the press used). In the case of rpm, the tablets per set of compressions per die per hour may be obtained by multiplying the rpm by 60 minutes per hour). The tablets obtained had an average mass of 2.87 grams, an average hardness of 112 N and an average friability of 0.26%. After production, the tablets were filled into metalized tin cans. Another set of cans was filled with a control sample composed of the roast ground coffee from which the tablets were made in untabletted form. Cans were sealed and stored at 70° F. After two weeks, these products were evaluated for the concentration of certain volatiles in the outgas obtained from these products at the time they were removed from their respective cans. In particular, for the control sample of conventional ground roast coffee, a coffee sample was removed from the can and placed in a closed container. In the case of the inventive coffee tablets, the tablets were gently broken apart to a particle size roughly equivalent to that of the conventional ground roast coffee of the control sample, and placed in a closed container. The outgas from the closed container of the conventional ground roast coffee and the broken apart tablets were analyzed. The concentrations of 25 different compounds were measured by gas chromatography, some representing the coffee volatiles recovered from the ground roast coffee in both examples and others representing the French Vanilla flavorant. The data obtained was normalized to enable a direct comparison of the concentrations of these ingredients in their respective outgases to one another. The results obtained are provided in FIG. 3. As can be seen from this figure, the coffee volatiles outgassed from both samples, i.e., the conventional (untabletted) coffee and the inventive coffee tablets, are essentially the same. Approximately 15 months after the samples mentioned above were analyzed, additional samples were taken from previously unopened cans of both the inventive coffee tablets and the conventional (untabletted) coffee. The above tests were repeated, and the results obtained reported in FIG. 4. As can be seen from this figure, essentially the same results were obtained.

The first set of tabletted product used roasted and ground Brazilian coffee beans, with a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.293 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜874 microns, and a moisture content of ˜3.2%. The first set of roasted and ground coffee was separated into five batches. Four of the batches were mixed with propylene glycol (“LFC”) at levels of 0.5 wt. %, 1.0 wt. %, 3.5 wt. %, and 6.0 wt. %, respectively. The fifth batch included no added liquid flavor carrier, but was mixed in a similar manner to the other batches. All mixing was done using a Forberg mixer. Each of the five batches were made into tablets using a Fette 2200 SE tabletting press at a variety of pre-compression and main compression forces. All tablets were produced at a rate of 90,000 tablets per hour. Hardness was measured immediately after production and again at least 6 days after production. Friability was measured at least 6 days after production. The results of these measurements are listed below in Table 21.

The roasted and ground coffee was separated into three batches. One batch was mixed with ˜3.5 wt. % propylene glycol (PG), based on the total weight of the composition obtained. A second batch was mixed with ˜1 wt. % propylene glycol. No flavor carrier was added to the third batch, although it was mixed in a similar manner to the other batches. All mixing was done using a Forberg mixer. Each of the three batches were made into tablets using a Fette 2200 SE tabletting press at a variety of pre-compression and main compression forces. All tablets were produced at a rate of 90,000 tablets per hour. Hardness was measured immediately after production and again at least 6 days after production. Friability was measured at least 6 days after production. The results of these measurements are listed below in Table 22. The minimal improvements in hardness and friability that accompanied the increases in liquid flavor concentration, as compared to the significant improvements observed in the test results of Example 10 and Example 13, set 1, suggest these results may be bad data, although this has not been confirmed.

Tablets were formed using varying pre-compression and final or main compression, and the hardness and friability of each tablet was calculated in a manner consistent with that described in Example 1.

Further, a tablet with a lower main compression (24.8 kN) but higher pre-compression (10.3 kN) may provide improved hardness and friability as compared to a tabled formed with a higher main compression (39 kN) and a lower pre-compression (5 kN). Example 15 Pre-Compression Brazilian coffee beans were roasted and ground. This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8%. The ground roast coffee so made was formed into cylindrical tablets containing ˜2.6-2.7 g ground roast coffee and having a diameter of about 24 to 24.5 mm by means of a Fette Model 2200SE multiple station tabletting machine operating at rates of 70,000 and 90,000 tablets per hour under different conditions in which the compaction forces in the pre-compression and main or primary compaction steps were varied. The hardness and friability of the tablets were tested in a manner consistent with the tablets of Example 1. The tablets so formed were then brewed in a manner consistent with the tablets of Example 1. The Yield was calculated based on the grams of coffee solids recovered in the brewed coffee (as determined by the mass and % brew solids in this brewed coffee product). Meanwhile, the Yield ratio was determined by comparing the Yield of coffee solids obtained when using inventive coffee tablets in comparison with the yield of coffee solids obtained in a control experiment in which untabletted coffee was used.

This ground roast coffee had a Hunter L-color of about 17-18, a bulk density of ˜0.288 g/cm 3 a mean particle size of about 700-800 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.43%. The ground roast coffee so made was formed into cylindrical tablets containing ˜2.66 gms ground roast coffee and having a diameter of about 24 to 24.5 mm by means of a Fette Model 2200SE multiple station tabletting machine operating at rates of 70,000 and 80,000 tablets per hour under different conditions in which the compaction forces in the pre-compression and main or primary compaction steps were varied. The hardness of the tablets so made was determined using a Varian VK200 Tablet Hardness tester set in the N (Newton) mode, while the friability of the tablets obtained using a Varian Friabilator having a dual chamber drum by rotating 25 grams of the tablets in the drum of the machine for 100 revolutions at a rate of 25 rpm and then determining the amount of these tablets that passes through a #4 American Standard Wire Mesh screen. Multiple tablets were tested for each batch of tablets made. The tablets so formed were then brewed into brewed coffee with Mr. Coffee® Model DR13 coffee makers, using 10 tablets (˜26.5 gms) and 1420 ml of water for each batch of brewed coffee brewed. For comparison purposes, a control experiment was run in the same way but using 26.5 gms conventional coffee, i.e., ground roast coffee in untabletted form. The Yield was calculated based on the grams of coffee solids recovered in the brewed coffee (as determined by the mass and percent brew solids in this brewed coffee product). Meanwhile, the Yield ratio was determined by comparing the Yield of coffee solids obtained when using inventive coffee tablets in comparison with the yield of coffee solids obtained in a control experiment in which untabletted coffee was used.

Coffee 17C was prepared from decaffeinated coffee beans, roasted and ground to a bulk density of ˜0.323 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜782 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.79%. Coffee 17D was prepared from coffee beans including a mixture of washed arabicas, naturals, and robustas having a Hunter L-color of ˜15.4, a bulk density of ˜0.285 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜710 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.89%. Coffee 17E was prepared from 10% regular ground roast arabica coffee, 40% regular ground roast robusta coffee, and 50% ground roast arabica coffee derived from coffee beans that had been low-moisture dried to a moisture content of about 5% to produce a ground roast coffee mixture comprising 60% arabica and 40% robusta coffees, the coffee mixture having a Hunter L color of ˜15.7, a mean particle size of ˜635 microns, a density of ˜0.247 g/cm 3 and a moisture content of ˜4.46%. Coffees 17A, 17B, 17C, 17D, and 17E were each made into tablets weighing about 2.66 grams each (ranging from about 2.62 g to about 2.70 g) using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using several different operating conditions. These conditions were some combination of changes in operating speed (rpm) and resulting compression dwell time, pre-compression force, and/or main compression force. Samples of the tablets from each run were tested for hardness and friability, with average values calculated for each of these properties. After compression, 10 tablets from each run were brewed in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. After brewing, the percent of solids extracted into the brew was measured by refractive index, which was then converted into total solids extracted. As shown in Table 26 below, tablets having very high hardnesses (i.e., >90N) were able to be produced without the aid of binders.

Coffee 18B was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8%. Coffees 18A and 18B were then each made into tablets weighing about 3 grams each using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using several different operating conditions. These conditions were some combination of changes in operating speed (rpm) (and resulting compression dwell time), pre-compression force, and/or main compression force. Samples of the tablets from each run were initially tested for hardness and density, with average values calculated for each of these properties. At least 6 days after production, additional samples of each run were tested for hardness, density, and friability, with average values calculated for each of these properties. These results were arranged by final density for each coffee, as shown in Table 27 below. As shown in Table 27, tablets having similar densities exhibited widely varying friabilities and hardnesses.

Tablets were made using the operating conditions identified in Table 28 below. Coffee 19B was prepared from Brazilian coffee beans, roasted and ground to a Hunter L-color of ˜18.8, a bulk density of ˜0.301 g/cm 3 , a mean particle size of ˜878 microns, and a moisture content of ˜4.8%, and was made into tablets in a single run (G), the tablets weighing about 2.65 grams each, using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process in which the pre-compression step was carried out at a lower compaction force than the main compression step. Tablets were made using the operating conditions identified in Table 28 below. Samples of the tablets from each run were tested for hardness and friability, with average values for each of these properties shown in Table 28. Additionally, tablets of a competitive tabletted coffee product (H) were collected for testing, as identified in Table 28 below. After compression, 10 tablets from each run (totaling approximately 26.5 g), equivalent amounts of the corresponding roasted and ground coffee, and 4 tablets (totaling approximately 28.7 g) of the competitive tabletted coffee product, were brewed with approximately 1420 g water in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker having a water delivery rate of approximately 2.75 g/sec. To measure instantaneous brew characteristics at increments throughout the brew (or “brew dynamics”), the brew was collected at 20 second increments in separate, small containers. For each 20 second accumulation or sample of brew, mass, refractive index, and absorbance were measured, and amount of brew solids and yield were determined from the measured refractive index (as explained in greater detail above). The samples were then incrementally and chronologically combined to measure and calculate cumulative mass, refractive index, brew solids, and yield.

As shown, the roast and ground coffees and the competitive coffee tablets exhibit higher instantaneous concentrations in an initial portion of the brews (i.e., the first 200-300 g of brew), while the inventive tabletted coffees exhibit higher instantaneous concentrations than their roast and ground counterparts and the competitive tabletted coffee subsequent to these initial portions, most substantially so in a mid-range portion of the brews (i.e., the 200-300 g of brew immediately following the initial 200-300 g of brew). FIG. 6 graphically illustrates the average cumulative extracted coffee solids over the course of the brew for the low pre-compression tablets (A and B) of Coffee 19A, the high pre-compression tablets (C, D, E, and F) of Coffee 19A, Coffee 19A in roast and ground form, and the competitor tablet H. As shown, the tabletted coffees exhibited an initial lag in extraction, as compared to their roast and ground coffee counterparts, while exceeding the extraction of the roast and ground coffees after an intermediate point in the brew (i.e., about 550-850 g into the brew). FIGS. 7 and 8 graphically illustrate the instantaneous coffee solids concentration and cumulative extracted coffee solids over the course of the brew for Coffee 19B in tabletted and roast and ground form, again showing higher initial instantaneous concentrations of coffee solids for the roast and ground coffee, and higher mid-range instantaneous concentrations of coffee solids for the tabletted coffee, as well as an initial lag in extraction for the tabletted coffee, as compared to the roast and ground coffee counterpart, with the tabletted coffee exceeding the extraction of the roast and ground coffees after an intermediate point in the brew (i.e., about 550-850 g into the brew). FIGS. 9 and 10 graphically show similar results in separately comparing five different runs of tablets produced from Coffee 19A as compared to their corresponding roast and ground coffee counterpart. As an alternative measure of the initial and mid-range brew characteristics, 10 tablets from each run (totaling approximately 26.5 g), equivalent amounts of the corresponding roasted and ground coffee, and 4 tablets (totaling approximately 28.1 g) of the competitive tabletted coffee product, were again brewed with approximately 1420 g water in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. An initial approximately 250 g portion of each brew was collected and a subsequent 250 g (“mid-range”) portion immediately following the initial portion was collected. For each of the initial and mid-range portions, refractive index and absorbance were measured, and amount of brew solids and yield were determined from the measured refractive index (as explained in greater detail above). The samples were then combined with the remainder of each total brew to measure and calculate mass, refractive index, brew solids, and yield for each total brew. As evident in Table 29 below, coffee brewed from the inventive coffee tablets produced with higher pre-compression force (i.e., greater than 30% of the main compression force) exhibited the lowest initial brew solids and absorbances and the highest mid-range brew solids and absorbances. Coffee brewed from the roasted and ground coffee samples exhibited the highest initial brew solids and absorbances and the lowest mid-range brew solids and absorbances. Coffee brewed from the inventive coffee tablets produced with lower pre-compression forces (8-10% of the main compression force) exhibited higher initial brew solids and absorbances and lower mid-range brew solids and absorbances that the coffee brewed from the higher pre-compression tablets. Coffee brewed from the competitive coffee tablets exhibited higher initial brew solids and absorbances and lower mid-range brew solids and absorbances that the coffee brewed from the lower pre-compression tablets.

Each coffee was made into tablets in several runs, using a Fette Model 2090 rotary tablet press set up to subject the tablets to a two-step compaction process. The production runs used varying tablet masses, production rates/dwell times, and pre-compression and main compression forces. For a number of production runs, relatively high production rates (or low compression dwell times) were used. For production rates of 90,000 to 120,000 tabs per hour (9.7 ms-14 ms compression dwell time), tablets having relatively high hardness (greater than 40 N) and relatively low friability (less than 10) were produced, as shown in Table 30 below. After compression, 10 tablets from each run (totaling approximately 26-27 g) were brewed with approximately 1420 g water in a Mr. Coffee® Accel (Model PRX 23) ADC coffee-maker. After brewing, the absorbance of the brew was measured, as described above, and the percent of solids extracted into the brew was measured by refractive index, which was then converted into total solids extracted and yield. coffee ktab/ dwell Pre Main pre/ Tablet Refr Brew Yield abs/ Br Yield abs name Run mass hr time Comp Comp main Hard Fri density Index Solid % Abs. gram index Index index 20A 19 2.70 120 10.5 20.6 41 0.50 52.5 2.6 1.029 1.33326 0.603 28.5 2.071 0.077 1.10 1.06 20A 18 2.64 120 10.5 20.5 31 0.66 46.9 6.1 0.976 1.33322 0.583 28.4 2.122 0.081 1.10 1.09 20A 20 2.68 120 10.5 30.8 40.2 0.77 52.6 7.6 1.034 1.33329 0.616 29.5 2.142 0.079 1.14 1.10 20B 4 2.97 90 14.0 40.8 50.1 0.81 63.0 8.3 1.011 1.33355 0.740 32.1 2.184 0.073 1.26 1.12 20B 16 3.03 120 10.5 30.2 40 0.76 50.8 8.6 0.952 1.33343 0.683 29.6 2.242 0.075 1.16 1.15 20B 17 3.00 120 10.5 30.1 45.5 0.66 54.1 7.1 0.968 1.33344 0.689 29.4 2.252 0.074 1.15 1.16 20B 2 2.96 90 14.0 19.9 50.8 0.39 56.1 4.2 0.979 1.33347 0.702 30.1 2.214 0.074 1.18 1.14 20C 5 2.66 90 14.0 40.0 55.8 0.72 56.1 5.7 0.990 1.33325 0.598 28.6 2.059 0.077 1.12 1.10 20C 2 2.64 90 14.0 20.1 50.9 0.39 55.5 2.6 0.977 1.33328 0.612 29.3 1.991 0.074 1.15 1.06 20D 16 2.62 130 9.7 26.5 46 0.58 41.5 8.1 0.953 1.33327 0.607 29.7 1.906 0.072 1.22 1.17 20E 4 2.67 90 14 30.7 49.6 0.62 56.3 4.7 0.993 1.33329 0.616 29.9 1.838 0.069 1.23 1.09 20E 1 2.65 90 14 29.9 40.4 0.74 52.7 4.2 0.983 1.33323 0.588 28.4 1.948 0.073 1.17 1.16 20F 1 2.45 90 14 40.2 50.2 0.8 40.8 6.6 0.984 1.3331 0.526 28.2 1.939 0.080 1.11 1.17 20F 8 2.40 90 14 19.9 49.9 0.4 47.1 2.0 0.973 1.33316 0.555 29.5 1.904 0.079 1.17 1.15 20G 17 2.65 90 13.9 20.2 34.8 0.6 55.0 0.7 0.918 1.33309 0.570 27.6 1.546 0.058 1.19 1.191 1.218 20G 19 2.68 90 13.9 45.1 51.4 0.9 53.5 2.7 0.957 1.33308 0.565 27.6 1.580 0.060 1.18 1.193 1.245 20H 4 2.65 90 13.9 24.9 35.4 0.7 51.6 3.1 0.922 1.33300 0.521 25.7 1.553 0.060 1.08 1.099 1.241 20H 7 2.59 100 12.7 29.6 40.8 0.7 43.7 4.7 0.923 1.33304 0.543 26.5 1.530 0.057 1.13 1.132 1.223 20G 18 2.67 90 13.9 20.4 44.2 0.5 54.3 1.5 0.932 1.33306 0.554 26.5 1.545 0.058 1.15 1.146 1.217 20I 1 2.65 90 14.2 20.3 40.2 0.5 51.4 1.2 1.33307 0.559 27.6 1.571 0.060 1.13 1.143 1.205 20J 6 2.67 90 13.9 25.4 35 0.7 45.1 3.6 1.33306 0.554 26.7 1.469 0.055 1.20 1.178 1.313 20K 7 2.65 90 13.9 24.5 35.2 0.7 53.8 1.9 1.33305 0.548 26.8 1.634 0.062 1.11 1.121 1.347 Although only a few embodiments of this invention have been described above, it should be appreciated that many modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Numerous roasting processes are known and employed in the roasting of green coffee beans. In conventional roasting, the coffee beans are contacted with hot roasting gas which transfers heat to the coffee beans and increases the temperature of the coffee beans to cause roasting to a desired color. Modifications of conventional roasting processes have been made to accomplish roasting in a relatively short period of several minutes or less. Such ""fast roasting"" systems have been found to produce an improvement in the amount of water soluble solids extractable from the roasted coffee. Roasted and ground coffee has been widely sold for many years in the United States and other countries in a ""one pound"" size can which holds 1,000 cc of the coffee and which yields about 85 cups of coffee. A 1,000 cc quantity of roasted and ground coffee made by grinding coffee beans which have been roasted by a conventional roasting process weighs about 16 ounces. Fast roasting conditions which cause an increase in brew yield have the additional effect of reducing the density of the roasted and ground coffee. The increase in brew yield makes it possible to obtain the same number of cups of coffee from a lower weight of coffee beans, thus providing a potential cost savings both to the manufacturer and the consumer. The decrease in density makes it possible to obtain the same, or approximately the same, number of cups of coffee from a given volume of coffee. This makes it convenient for the consumer to use the less dense coffee since the volume of coffee employed by the consumer in brewing is essentially the same as the consumer had used in brewing conventional roasted coffee. While the reduced density of fast roast coffee has the advantages mentioned above, conventional roasting is still employed commercially to satisfy consumer demand for coffee having aroma and flavor characteristic of roasted coffee. One of the important characteristics of roasted coffee is the aroma of freshly roasted and ground coffee. As reported at page 211 of the ACS Symposium Services ""Thermally Generated Flavor, Maillard, Microwave and Extrusion Processes"", Parliment et al., Editors, American Chemical Society, Washington D.C. (1994), methanethiol (or methylmercaptan) is a key compound for the pleasant aroma arising from freshly roasted and ground coffee and its quantification has been suggested as an analytical monitoring process for roasted whole bean freshness. There is a need for low density coffee which retains the increased brew yield of fast roasted coffee and which has an enhanced package headspace methylmercaptan content. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The roasting method of the invention comprises: (a) in a first stage, contacting green coffee beans with heated roasting gas for a time period of from 5 to 15 minutes until the coffee beans are roasted to a roast color of from 30-50 Lu; (b) in a second stage, contacting the coffee beans roasted in the first stage with heated roasting gas for a time period of from 0.5 to 3.5 minutes to produce roasted coffee having a roast color of from 4-19 Lu; and (c) rapidly cooling the roasted coffee to terminate roasting to produce roasted coffee having a density of from 0.27 to 0.38 and a roast color of 4-19 Lu. Roasted coffee beans in accordance with the invention have a density of from 0.27 to 0.38, a roast color of 4-19 Lu, and a package headspace methylmercaptan content of at least 10 micrograms per gram of coffee. Roasted and ground coffee in accordance with the invention is prepared by grinding beans roasted in accordance with the invention. DEFINITIONS ""Density"" when used herein in connection with roasted coffee beans means free flow density measured by permitting a sample of beans to freely fall from a hopper having an opening, controlled by a slide gate, with the opening positioned three inches above an open-topped cube measuring 4 inches on a side and with the open top of the cube centered beneath the opening of the hopper. The slide gate is opened, permitting beans to freely fall from the hopper into and to overflow the cube. The excess coffee is then struck off the top of the cube with a straight edge, by a pushing and sawing motion and without tapping, until the sample is level with the top of the cube. The weight of the sample is then determined and the free flowing density determined based on the volume of the cube. ""Package headspace methylmercaptan content"" when used herein in connection with roasted coffee beans means the content of methylmercaptan in the headspace of packaged roasted and ground coffee prepared from roasted coffee beans and determined by the following procedure. Twenty-four hours after roasting, the roasted beans are ground to a medium grind (approximately 800 microns as measured by a Sympatec laser particle size analyzer) with a benchtop coffee grinder (Modern Process Equipment Co., Chicago, Ill.). Thirty to forty minutes after grinding, the product is packed in a traditional one pound coffee tin and vacuum packed (29"" Hg vacuum). After storing for 5 to 9 days at ambient conditions, the can is pierced and allowed to come to atmospheric pressure. The hole is then sealed with a septum. After 30 minutes at room temperature to allow the can to equilibrate, a 1 cc sample of headspace is extracted through the septum with a gas syringe. The extracted sample is then subjected to gas chromatography to determine the amount of methylmercaptan in the 1 cc sample. The total amount of methylmercaptan in the package headspace is then calculated by multiplying the amount in the sample by the void volume within the tin. The void volume within the tin is calculated by subtracting the actual volume (i.e., based on true density of the coffee as opposed to its bulk density) occupied by the coffee in the tin from the total volume of the tin. ""Roast color"", in ""Lu"" units, means roast color which is indirectly measured using visible light reflectance of a ground sample of the roasted coffee beans, using a Dr. Lange Color Reflectance Meter Model LK-100 with an internal 640 nm filter. (Dr. Lange GmbH, Dusseldorf, Germany). The beans are ground in a benchtop coffee grinder (Modern Process Equipment Co.) to achieve an ADC (i.e., automatic drip coffeemaker) grind of 780 microns. The ground coffee sample is then poured loosely into a petri dish in the leveling device supplied with the Dr. Lange reflectance meter. A handle is then manipulated to obtain a flat surface on the sample. The petri dish is then removed from the leveling device and placed in the drawer of the reflectance meter. The instrument is then activated and the reflectance measurement is displayed. The lower the reflectance value, the darker the roast color. Particle sizes are determined by a Sympatec HELOS/LA laser diffraction spectrometer with a 2000 mm optical system (Sympatec, Inc., Princeton, N.J.). The funnel height and feed rate of the sample are adjusted to give an optical concentration passing through the laser of about 5-10%. The sample size is preferably about 100 grams. ""Titratable acidity"" is reported as ml of a 0.1N sodium hydroxide needed to titrate a 100 ml aliquot of brewed coffee to a pH of 6.0. The 100 ml aliquot is taken from a brew prepared in a MR. COFFEE domestic automatic drip coffee maker. The brew is prepared from 29.2 grams of roasted and ground coffee (approximate average particle size of 780 microns) with 1460 ml of water. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The roasting method of the present invention is carried out in two distinct roasting stages. The first stage is of relatively longer duration and lower temperature and the second is of relatively shorter duration and higher temperature. Virtually any type of coffee roasting apparatus can be employed, including conventional batch roasters and continuous roasters. It is preferred that the second roasting stage is initiated immediately after the first stage is concluded. Batch roasters are preferred because of their relative simplicity and because of the relative ease of changing roasting conditions. Preferred batch coffee roasters include the well known horizontal drum roasters such as PROBAT and THERMALO roasters and fluidized bed roasters (e.g., NEOTEC). However, other roasters such as those described at pages 89-97 of Coffee, Vol 2: Technology, Clarke & Macrae (Eds.) Elsevier Applied Science, New York (1987) are suitable, provided only that the roaster can accommodate the two stage roasting sequence and conditions of the present invention. The roasting process of the present invention is applicable to any type of coffee. As shown in the working examples, highly satisfactory results have been obtained with various types of coffee, including washed arabica coffee from Colombia, natural arabica coffee from Brazil, and robusta coffee from Vietnam. Coffee beans roasted in accordance with the invention have a reduced free flow density similar to that of fast roast coffee. The density will vary with the type of coffee, as well as with the degree of roast, but is generally within the range of 0.27-0.38. For the least dense beans such as natural arabicas from Brazil, the density of the roasted beans will be generally in the range of 0.27 (for a dark roast) to 0.34 (for a light roast). For the most dense beans such as the robustas, density will generally be in the range of from 0.32 (for a dark roast) to 0.38 (for a light roast). Medium density coffees such as washed arabicas from Colombia, will have an intermediate density, again dependent on roast color, in the range of about 0.29 to 0.37. The roast color of coffee beans roasted in accordance with the two stage roasting method of the invention is in the range of 4-19 Lu, for all bean types. The package headspace methylmercaptan content of coffee beans roasted in accordance with the invention, measured as described above, is at least 10 and preferably 10-20 micrograms per gram of coffee. Levels of up to about 40 ug/g are reported in the examples. A level of about 50 or 60 ug/g may constitute a practical upper limit which is well below the level at which methylmercaptan would adversely affect the package headspace aroma. During the roasting process, the beans are heated primarily by contact with heated roasting gas, typically hot combustion gas and excess air. Some heat may also be imparted to the beans by contact with a hot surface, such as the hot surface of a roasting drum, by radiant heat, or both. In the first stage of the roasting process, the beans are roasted for a relatively long period of from 5-15 minutes, and preferably about 7.5-11 minutes. Roasting is continued until roast color is in the range of 30-50 Lu, preferably 35-45, for all bean types, and until the beans reach a temperature in the range of about 300-410° F. to assure that roasting starts. The temperature and quantity of heated roasting gas required in each stage of the roasting method to achieve the appropriate bean temperature and roast color will, of course, vary considerably with the type of roasting apparatus. For example, for a PROBAT Model G240 roaster, an air inlet temperature of about 725-925° F. at a flowrate in the range of 2000-2500 ACFM (actual cubic feet per minute) is appropriate during the first roasting stage for a 400 lb. batch of beans, while for a NEOTEC RFB-6 fluidized bed roaster, an air inlet temperature of about 340-410° F. at an air flow rate in the range of 275-350 ACFM is suitable for first stage roasting of a 3.3 pound batch of coffee beans. Air inlet temperatures and flowrates within the foregoing ranges of conditions are also generally suitable for the second roasting stage. The second stage of the roasting process is preferably initiated immediately after the first stage is concluded. During the second stage, the beans are roasted for a generally shorter time period of from about 1/2-31/2 minutes, preferably about 1-3 minutes. It will be apparent that the total roasting time, i.e., the roasting time of the first and second stages, can be well within the 12-15 minute time period of conventional roasting. Second stage roasting is continued until roast color is in the range of 4-19 Lu for all bean types and until the beans reach a temperature in the range of about 365-450° F. After reaching the desired extent of roasting in the second stage of the roasting process, roasting is terminated by rapidly cooling the roasted beans to a temperature below that at which roasting would continue. Cooling is conveniently effected in a manner known in coffee roasting by spraying water on the roasted beans, or by contacting the roasted beans with cool air, or both. Suitable cooling systems are widely available commercially. Quenching with water is preferred because it facilitates quickly stopping the roasting process at a desired degree of roast. Quenching with water to achieve a moisture content of about 3-7%, and preferably about 5% by weight based on the weight of the roasted beans, is preferred. Cooling is preferably effected by first quenching with a water spray to obtain a desired moisture content followed by air-cooling to ambient until the beans are cooled to a temperature of less than about 140° F. and preferably less than 120° F., after which the beans may be permitted to cool to ambient temperature. EXAMPLE 1 400 lb. of washed arabica coffee from Colombia are roasted in a PROBAT model G240 coffee roaster (made by Probat GmbH, Emmerich, Germany) in a two step process, without stopping between steps. In step one the roaster gas temperature is set at 876° F. and the air flow is set at 2375 ACFM. After 7 minutes and 48 seconds the bean temperature at the end of step one reaches 305° F. The roaster gas temperature is then raised to 1027° F. and the air flow is increased to 2404 ACFM to immediately initiate step two. After an additional 2 minutes and 42 seconds the bean temperature reaches 380° F. and the roasting is stopped by adding 6.5 gallons of quench water over a 15-30 second period. The roasted coffee is then discharged from the roasting chamber and cooled to less than 104° F. Samples from this batch have a roast color of 14.1 Lu., a moisture of 5.4%, a roasted bean density of 0.366 g/cc, and aroma analysis indicates a package headspace methylmercaptan level of 11.2 μg/g coffee. Titratable acidity (in ml of 0.1N sodium hydroxide) is 2.2. A sample taken at the end of step one has a roast color of 36.4 Lu. Coffee beverages prepared from the roasted coffee of this example are judged by expert tasters as being medium-bodied, smooth and rich with good acidity and floral notes typical of a good quality Colombian (washed arabica) coffee with this degree of roast. The coffee is also judged to be not bitter. EXAMPLE 2 400 lb. of natural arabica coffee from Brazil are roasted in a PROBAT model G240 coffee roaster in a two step process, without stopping between steps. In step one the roaster gas temperature is set at 860° F. and the air flow is set at 2245 ACFM. After 7 minutes and 48 seconds the bean temperature at the end of step one reaches 324° F. The roaster gas temperature is then raised to 1060° F. and the air flow is increased to 2276 ACFM to immediately initiate step two. After an additional 2 minutes and 30 seconds the bean temperature reaches 404° F. and the roasting is stopped by adding 7.3 gallons of quench water over a 15-30 second period. The roasted coffee is then discharged from the roasting chamber and cooled to less than 104° F. Samples from this batch have a roast color of 9.5 Lu., a moisture of 5.1%, a roasted bean density of 0.327 g/cc, and aroma analysis indicates a package headspace methylmercaptan level of 19.0 μg/g coffee. A sample taken at the end of step one has a roast color of 42.1 Lu. Coffee beverages prepared from the roasted coffee of this example are judged by expert tasters as being full-bodied with earthy notes and some acidity typical of a good quality Brazilian (natural arabica) coffee with this degree of roast. The coffee is also judged to be not bitter. EXAMPLE 3 400 lb. of robusta coffee from Vietnam are roasted in a PROBAT model G240 coffee roaster in a two step process, without stopping between steps. In step one the roaster gas temperature is set at 860° F. and the air flow is set at 2175 ACEM. After 9 minutes and 48 seconds the bean temperature at the end of step one reaches 324° F. The roaster gas temperature is raised to 1060° F. and the air flow is increased to 2350 ACFM to immediately initiate step two. After an additional 2 minutes and 42 seconds the bean temperature reaches 402° F. and the roasting is stopped by adding 7.4 gallons of quench water over a 15-30 second period. The roasted coffee is then discharged from the roasting chamber and cooled to less than 104° F. Samples from this batch have a roast color of 15.2 Lu., a moisture of 5.8% a roasted bean density of 0.353 g/cc and aroma analysis indicates a package headspace methylmercaptan level of 21.0 μg/g coffee. A sample taken at the end of step one has a roast color of 44.0 Lu. Coffee beverages prepared from the roasted coffee of this example are judged by expert tasters as being light-bodied but hearty/robust with a characteristic peanut shell flavor typical of a robusta coffee with this degree of roast. The coffee is also judged to be not bitter. EXAMPLE 4 3.3 lb.

BACKGROUND ART A latte (caffè latte) is a coffee drink of Italian origin which is made by mixing espresso and milk. In recent years, American style cafeterias have been widespread, and lattes have been popular as a highly palatable beverage in Japan. Further, there have been developed different liquid coffee concentrates for making lanes, which make it possible to easily make at home lattes with a rich taste like those made in cafeterias (e.g., NPLs 1, 2). Meanwhile, caffeine present in coffee may stimulate the central nervous system, the heart or the digestive system such as stomach and intestines. People with high sensitivity to such stimulation of caffeine or with high health consciousness are more likely to avoid caffeine. Thus, decaffeinated coffee beverages from which caffeine is reduced or removed have been developed and commercialized in the market. However, since caffeine is one of the main taste ingredients of coffee, the problem is that when caffeine is reduced or removed from coffee, the kokumi and bitter tastes characteristic of coffee become less noticeable causing a loss of flavor of coffee. Therefore, there have been proposed different techniques of improving the flavor of decaffeinated coffee. Exemplary techniques of improving the flavor of decaffeinated coffee include, but are not limited to, the following: addition of theanine to decaffeinated coffee (PTL 1); incorporation of ethyl isovalerate in decaffeinated coffee (PTL 2); incorporation of potassium sulfate and/or potassium lactate in decaffeinated coffee (PTL 3); addition of a neutral amino acid such as valine, leucine or isoleucine to a decaffeinated coffee matter (PTL 4); and incorporation of a quercetin glycoside in low-caffeine coffee (PTL 5).

Thus, it is important that beverages prepared with addition of milk should have noticeable richness (kokumi taste) and bitterness characteristic of coffee while coffee aroma is not masked. In particular, since liquid concentrates of decaffeinated coffee are low in caffeine as a taste ingredient, the problem is that when such liquid concentrates are diluted with milk, prepared beverages are more likely to lose the inherent aroma of coffee, i.e., rich coffee kokumi taste and unique coffee bitterness lingering in the mouth after drinking (hereinafter also referred to as “bitter aftertaste”). An object of the present invention is to provide a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee intended for use to prepare a beverage that has a reduced caffeine content but does not lose the inherent aroma of coffee, especially the rich kokumi taste and bitter aftertaste of coffee, and which can make one enjoy an authentic latte aroma. Solution to Problem The present inventors found that when the contents of caffeine and acetic acid in a liquid concentrate of decaffeinated coffee are adjusted to be within the specified ranges, a beverage prepared by diluting the liquid concentrate with milk can have enhanced coffee tastes and give an authentic latte aroma without losing the inherent aroma of coffee, i.e., the rich kokumi taste and the bitter aftertaste of coffee. Thus, the inventors have completed the present invention. This invention is directed, but not limited, to the following. A liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, wherein the liquid concentrate satisfies the following requirements (i) to (iv): (i) the liquid concentrate should comprise caffeine (A) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g; (ii) the liquid concentrate should comprise acetic acid (B) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g; (iii) the liquid concentrate should have a concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] of from 0.7 to 25; (iv) the liquid concentrate should comprise a coffee flavor. [2] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in [1], wherein the liquid concentrate comprises caffeine (A) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.5 to 6 mg/100 g. [3] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in [1] or [2], further comprising a coffee extract, wherein the liquid concentrate has a coffee solids concentration of from 5 to 12% by weight. [4] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in [3], wherein the liquid concentrate has a coffee solids concentration of from 6 to 11% by weight. [5] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in [3] or [4], further comprising a coffee extract and a coffee flavoring. [6] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in any one of [3] to [5], wherein the liquid concentrate has a ratio of caffeine concentration to coffee solids concentration (caffeine concentration/coffee solids concentration) of not more than 2×10 −3 . [7] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in [6], wherein the liquid concentrate has a ratio of caffeine concentration to coffee solids concentration (caffeine concentration/coffee solids concentration) of not more than 4×10 −4 . [8] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in any one of [1] to [7], wherein the liquid concentrate has a pH of from 5.0 to 7.0. [9] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in [8], wherein the liquid concentrate has a pH of from 5.3 to 6.0. [10] The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee as set forth in any one of [1] to [9], wherein the liquid concentrate is intended to be diluted with milk. [11] A method for preparing a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, the method comprising the steps of: (i) adding caffeine (A) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g; (ii) adding acetic acid (B) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g; (iii) adjusting a concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range from 0.7 to 25; and (iv) adding a coffee flavor. Advantageous Effects of Invention By using the liquid concentrate of decaffeinated coffee of the present invention, there can be prepared a beverage which has a reduced caffeine content but can make one enjoy an authentic latte aroma. The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is also excellent in convenience since a latte having a low caffeine content but an authentic aroma can be easily prepared by simply mixing the liquid concentrate with milk. Further, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is advantageous in that it can be provided easily and inexpensively without the need for special equipment, since it can be prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges.

The coffee flavor will be described later. As referred to herein, the term “liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee” refers to a liquid coffee concentrate whose caffeine is reduced or removed, and more specifically to a coffee-flavored liquid which is to be diluted upon drinking, and which comprises caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g. The dilution factor used to dilute the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be set, as appropriate, according to the preference of a person who drinks a diluted beverage, but is preferably set to be in the range of from 3 to 6 times on a volume ratio basis. To be specific, for example, the dilution by a factor of 3 times on a volume ratio basis means that one volume of a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee is diluted with addition of two volumes of a dilution medium. All dilution factors as indicated herein are expressed on a volume ratio basis. The present invention is based on the discovery that by using a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges, a beverage prepared by diluting the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee can have an enhanced coffee taste. While the activity of acetic acid to enhance coffee tastes will be described later, acetic acid is capable of enhancing the tastes of caffeine present in small amounts. Therefore, it is necessary that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should comprise caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of at least 0.1 mg/100 g, and it is preferred from the viewpoint of reduction of caffeine content that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should comprise caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g. In order to ensure that the effect of this invention can be exhibited more effectively, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should comprise caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.3 to 8 mg/100 g, more preferably at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.5 to 6 mg/100 g, particularly preferably at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.8 to 3 mg/100 g. From another perspective, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention preferably has a ratio of caffeine concentration to coffee solids concentration (caffeine concentration/coffee solids concentration) of not more than 2×10 −3 , more preferably not more than 4×10 −4 . The coffee solids concentration will be described later. The caffeine content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be calculated by multiplying the caffeine content in a diluted beverage by a dilution factor. For example, when the dilution factor used to dilute the liquid coffee concentrate is 4 times, the “liquid coffee concentrate comprising caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g” means a liquid coffee concentrate comprising caffeine at a concentration of from 0.4 to 40 mg/100 g. On this basis, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, should comprise caffeine at a concentration of from 0.3 to 60 mg/100 g, more preferably from 0.9 to 48 mg/100 g, still more preferably from 1.5 to 36 mg/100 g, yet more preferably from 2.4 to 18 mg/100 g. The caffeine content in a liquid coffee concentrate, and the caffeine content in a diluted beverage can be measured by a known method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or the like. The method for adjusting the caffeine content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention to be within a desired range is not particularly limited. In order to achieve reduction of the caffeine content in a liquid coffee concentrate, a liquid coffee extract obtained from a source material composed of coffee beans whose caffeine is removed or reduced may be used, or caffeine may be removed or reduced from an obtained liquid coffee extract. Exemplary methods for removing or reducing caffeine include, but are not limited to: removal of caffeine from refined raw coffee beans; use of decaffeinated coffee beans produced by a plant breeding technique, genetic recombination or the like; selective removal of caffeine from raw coffee beans by immersion in a solvent such as an organic solvent, water, or supercritical fluid carbon dioxide; and adsorptive removal of caffeine from a liquid coffee extract using activated carbon and ion-exchange resins, etc. Such caffeine removal or reduction methods may be used alone or in combination. Conversely, in order to adjust the caffeine content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee to be within a desired range, the caffeine content may also be increased—in such a case, a caffeine preparation acceptable for use in foods and beverages may be added. (Acetic Acid) The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is characterized in that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges is diluted to yield a beverage having enhanced coffee tastes and having a rich kokumi taste and a bitter aftertaste comparable or superior to the aroma of a beverage prepared by diluting a liquid concentrate of non-decaffeinated coffee. Among different acid taste ingredients, acetic acid acts to specifically enhance the tastes of caffeine. The acetic acid content in the liquid coffee concentrate of the present invention is adjusted to a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g, preferably not less than 2 mg/100 g, more preferably not less than 3 mg/100 g, still more preferably not less than 6 mg/100 g. Acetic acid is known to be a volatile acid whose pungent acid odor adversely affects the aroma of coffee. With a view to enhancing the flavor of non-decaffeinated coffee beverages, various treatments have been proposed to reduce acetic acid from coffee beans (e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. JP 2011-97832, and Japanese Domestic Re-publication of PCT International Publication No. JPWO 2005-11396). In this invention, a specified amount of acetic acid is incorporated in a decaffeinated liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee. When the content of acetic acid added is too low, enhancement of the tastes of caffeine may not be achieved to the desired extent. Enhancement of the tastes of caffeine becomes more prominent with the increase of the concentration of acetic acid. However, when the acetic acid concentration in a diluted beverage exceeds 25 mg/100 g, enhancement of the tastes of caffeine reaches the plateau, and moreover the odor and taste of acetic acid may interfere with the desired effects. Therefore, the upper limit of the acetic acid content in the liquid coffee concentrate of the present invention is preferably set to a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not more than 25 mg/100 g, more preferably a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not more than 20 mg/100 g, still more preferably a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not more than 18 mg/100 g. Similarly to the calculation of caffeine content, the acetic acid content in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be calculated by multiplying the acetic acid content in a diluted beverage by a dilution factor. For example, when the dilution factor used to dilute the liquid coffee concentrate is 4 times, the “liquid coffee concentrate comprising acetic acid at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g” means a liquid coffee concentrate comprising acetic acid at a concentration of not less than 4 mg/100 g. On this basis, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, should comprise acetic acid at a concentration of not less than 3 mg/100 g, more preferably not less than 6 mg/100 g, still more preferably not less than 9 mg/100 g, yet more preferably not less than 18 mg/100 g. Also, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, should comprise acetic acid at a concentration of not more than 150 mg/100 g, more preferably not more than 120 mg/100 g, still more preferably not more than 108 mg/100 g. The acetic acid content in a liquid coffee concentrate, and the acetic acid content in a diluted beverage can be measured by a common organic acid analysis method using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or the like. The concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is also important for achieving the desired effects. To be specific, the concentration ratio [(B)/(A)] is in the range of from 0.7 to 25, preferably from 1 to 20, more preferably from 3 to 15, particularly preferably from 5 to 15. In particular, in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee comprising caffeine at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.5 to 6 mg/100 g, the concentration ratio [(B)/(A)] is preferably adjusted to be in the range of from 0.7 to 25, from 1 to 20, from 3 to 15, or from 5 to 15. The acetic acid used in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be of any type as long as it is of a type that can be added to beverages and foods. The acetic acid may be a salt thereof. Also, a crude extract, an extract, or a purified extract obtained from a natural product containing acetic acid ingredients may be added to a liquid coffee concentrate. (Coffee Flavor) The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention comprises a coffee flavor. Exemplary coffee flavors used in this invention include coffee flavorings used as food additives that can be added to beverages, and roasted coffee bean extracts containing coffee aroma components (hereinafter also referred to as “liquid coffee extracts”). A liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee comprising a coffee flavor, wherein the coffee flavor comprises a coffee flavoring and a liquid coffee extract, is one of preferred embodiments of this invention. The present inventors found that addition of a specific amount of acetic acid not only enhances the rich kokumi taste and bitter aftertaste of coffee, but also enhances a nut-like aroma. Therefore, when in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention, the coffee flavor comprises a coffee flavoring, the coffee flavoring preferably comprises a nut-like aroma component. Examples of nut-like aroma components include different types of pyrazines, such as 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine, and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine. Among those pyrazines, 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine is an advantageous aroma component since it has a nut-like aroma so that the effects of this invention can be prominently perceived. The type of a coffee flavoring used in the present invention is not particularly limited, and any commercially available coffee flavoring can be used as appropriate without limitation. Some skilled artisans may use the following coffee-related terms differently: i.e., use the term “fragrance” to refer to the aroma of roasted and ground coffee, the term “aroma” to refer to the aroma of a liquid coffee extract, and the term “flavor” to refer to the aroma perceived when liquid coffee is taken into the mouth. However, as used herein, the term “coffee flavoring” even covers flavorings having coffee fragrance and flavorings having coffee aroma. When a coffee favoring is added to the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention, the amount of the coffee flavoring added can be set, as appropriate, in consideration of the titer of the flavoring used, the dilution factor used to dilute the liquid coffee concentrate, and the like. The amount of the coffee flavoring added is generally in the range of approximately from 0.01 to 5.0% by weight, preferably approximately from 0.03 to 4.0% by weight, more preferably approximately from 0.05 to 3.0% by weight, still more preferably approximately from 0.1 to 1.5% by weight, based on the amount of the liquid coffee concentrate. In the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention, the coffee flavor may comprise a liquid coffee extract. As referred to herein, the term “liquid coffee extract” refers to a solution extracted from roasted and ground coffee beans with water, hot water or the like, and also covers a coffee essence obtained by concentrating a liquid coffee extract, and a solution adjusted to a proper volume by adding water, hot water or the like to a solid dry matter obtained by drying a liquid coffee extract. The type of coffee beans used to make a liquid coffee extract is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include, but are not limited to, Blue Mountain, High Mountain, Jamaica, Crystal Mountain, Guatemala Antigua, Colombia Supremo, Mocha Harar, Mocha Mattari, Kilimanjaro, Toraja, Kalosi, Gayo Mountain, Mandheling, Brazil, and Hawaii Kona. Exemplary coffee bean species include, but are not limited to, Arabica and Robusta . One type of coffee beans may be used alone, or two or more types thereof may be blended and used. Such raw coffee beans are roasted in a coffee roaster, and the thus-roasted coffee beans can be used as a source material to make a liquid coffee extract. The roasting can be carried out by, for example, introducing raw coffee beans into the interior of a rotary drum and heating the beans from the bottom of the drum with a gas burner or the like while stirring by rotating the drum. With regard to the degree of roasting of such coffee beans, the beans are roasted to an L-value of approximately from 14 to 30. Since the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is intended for use to prepare a latte, it is preferred that the liquid concentrate should have a taste reminiscent of espresso. In general, coffee beans become stronger in bitterness and kokumi taste as they are roasted more deeply—thus, deeply roasted coffee beans (with a L-value of approximately from 14 to 22, preferably approximately from 15 to 20) are generally used to make espresso. Similarly, in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention, deeply roasted coffee beans are preferably used as a source material to make a liquid coffee extract. As referred to above, the L-value is an indicator that reflects the degree of coffee roasting, and is a value of the brightness of a ground powder of roasted coffee beans as measured by a chronometer (0 represents black and 100 represent white). The method for extracting a liquid coffee extract from roasted coffee beans is not limited at all. For example, roasted coffee beans are ground to coarse, medium or fine grind, and ground coffee beans are extracted with water or hot water (at 0 to 200° C.) for a period of 10 seconds to 30 minutes. The extraction method can be selected, as appropriate, from known methods such as drip extraction, siphon extraction, boiling extraction, jet extraction, and continuous column extraction. For example, column extraction can be carried out by loading coffee beans into a column type extractor and supplying water or hot water to the extractor. In this method, multistep extraction may also be employed. As referred to above, the “multistep extraction” refers to an extraction process using an apparatus having independent extraction columns connected in series by pipings. The multistep extraction is an advantageous extraction process from the viewpoint of aroma, since in this process, a liquid extract having a high coffee solids content comparable to that of a liquid concentrate can be recovered without taking a concentration step. It is acceptable that a liquid comprising such a coffee flavor as described above may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate serving as a base to make the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention (hereinafter also referred to as “liquid coffee concentrate base”), and that the caffeine concentration, the acetic acid concentration, and the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid coffee concentrate base may be adjusted to be within the specified ranges, thereby to prepare the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention. In another instance, it is also acceptable that such a liquid coffee extract as described above may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate base as it is, and that the caffeine concentration, the acetic acid concentration, and the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid coffee concentrate base may be adjusted to be within the specified ranges, thereby to prepare the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention. In still another instance, it is also acceptable that such a liquid coffee extract as described above may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate base as it is, and that the caffeine concentration, the acetic acid concentration, and the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] in the liquid coffee concentrate base may be adjusted to be within the specified ranges, and a coffee flavoring may be further added as required, thereby to prepare the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention. When the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention comprises a liquid coffee extract, it is preferred that the coffee solids concentration in the liquid coffee extract should be adjusted to be in the range of from 5 to 12% by weight. Further, when the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention comprises a liquid coffee extract, it is preferred that the liquid coffee extract should be present in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee at a concentration sufficient to ensure that the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee is in the range of from 5 to 12% by weight. A liquid coffee extract having a coffee solids concentration of from 5 to 12% by weight may be used as a liquid coffee concentrate base either as it is or as diluted to an appropriate volume, and may be made into a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee having a coffee solids concentration of from 5 to 12% by weight. As referred to herein, the term “coffee solids”, as in e.g. such a liquid coffee extract as described above, refers to the weight (g) of soluble solids in the liquid coffee extract, which is determined from a sugar refractometer index (Brix) reading at 20° C. To be specific, the weight (g) of coffee solids in the liquid coffee extract is determined by measuring a sugar refractometer index (Brix) of the liquid coffee extract using a sugar refractometer (e.g., RX-5000 produced by Atago Co., Ltd.) and multiplying the Brix reading by the amount (g) of the liquid coffee extract used for measurement. As referred to herein, the term “coffee solids concentration” refers to a coffee solids concentration (% by weight) calculated based on the weight (g) of coffee solids determined by the above procedure. To be specific, the coffee solids concentration (% by weight) in a liquid coffee extract can be determined by calculating the percentage of the weight of coffee solids determined by the above procedure relative to the weight of the liquid coffee extract. Also, the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention can be determined by the same procedure as described above. Additionally, such a Brix value as described above may be used to refer to the coffee solids concentration in the liquid coffee extract or liquid coffee concentrate in this invention. When the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is not less than 5% by weight (preferably not less than 6% by weight), a beverage prepared by diluting the liquid concentrate with milk by a factor of from 3 to 6 times is more likely to have noticeable tastes inherent in coffee, and the rich kokumi taste and bitterness inherent in coffee can be enhanced more strongly by adding acetic acid in the amount specified above. It is preferred from the viewpoint of aroma that the upper limit of the coffee solids concentration in the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention should be not more than 12% by weight, more preferably not more than 11% by weight, particularly preferably not more than 10% by weight. (Other Components) From the viewpoint that the effects of the present invention can be prominently exhibited, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention preferably has a pH of from 5.0 to 7.0, more preferably from 5.0 to 6.0, still more preferably from 5.3 to 6.0. The pH adjustment can be made using a common pH adjustor such as sodium hydrogen carbonate or sodium hydroxide. In addition to the components described above, other components may be added, as appropriate, to the extent that such other components do not impair the effects of this invention—examples of such other components include, but are not limited to, sweeteners (e.g., sucrose, isomerized sugar, glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, aspartame, acesulfame K, sucralose, and stevia ), antioxidants (e.g., sodium L-ascorbate), emulsifiers (e.g., sucrose fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyglycerol fatty acid esters), acidulants, and flavorings. (Dilution Medium) Any type of dilution medium can be used to dilute the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention as long as such a dilution medium is a liquid acceptable for use in foods and beverages, with milk being preferably used as a dilution medium. The liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of the present invention is characterized in that the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee prepared by adjusting caffeine and acetic acid contents to be within the specified ranges is diluted with a dilution medium to yield a beverage having enhanced coffee tastes and having a rich kokumi taste and a bitter aftertaste comparable or superior to the aroma of a beverage prepared by diluting a non-decaffeinated liquid coffee concentrate. Therefore, even when the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is mixed with plenty of milk, it is possible to prepare a beverage having a rich kokumi taste and a pronounced bitter taste (esp., bitter aftertaste) of coffee, without being masked by milk. As described above, the liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee of this invention is advantageously used as a liquid concentrate which is to be diluted with milk. As referred to herein, the term “milk” refers to a white liquid containing fine colloidal particles of protein and fat that can mask the aroma of coffee if used as they are, and includes animal milks such as cow's milk, and vegetable milks such as soybean milk, almond milk, rice milk, and coconut milk. (Method for Preparing a Liquid Concentrate of Low-Caffeine Coffee) In another aspect, the present invention is also directed to a method for preparing a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee intended for use to prepare a beverage that has a reduced caffeine content but does not lose the inherent aroma of coffee, especially the rich kokumi taste and bitter aftertaste of coffee, and which makes one feel an authentic latter aroma. To be specific, the present invention is directed to a method for preparing a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee which is to be diluted by a factor of from 3 to 6 times to yield a beverage suitable for drinking, the method comprising the steps of: (i) adding caffeine (A) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g; (ii) adding acetic acid (B) at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage having an acetic acid concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g; (iii) adjusting a concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range from 0.7 to 25; and (iv) adding a coffee flavor. EXAMPLES Hereunder, the present invention will be specifically described in detail by reference to experimental examples, but this invention is not limited to these examples. Unless otherwise stated herein, all numerical ranges are inclusive of their endpoints. In working examples presented herein, the amounts of components in beverage samples were measured by following the procedures described below. <Measurement of Caffeine Concentration> In order to quantify caffeine concentration, different samples were diluted by 10 times (w/w) with mobile phase A, filtered through a membrane filter (produced by Advantec Co., Ltd.; cellulose acetate type; pore size: 0.45 μm), and injected into HPLC.

The HPLC measurement conditions are as follows. Model: LC-20AD (produced by Shimadzu Corporation) Detector: Electrical conductivity detector CDD-10AVP (produced by Shimadzu Corporation) Column: Shim-pack SCR-102H×2, 8 mmφ×300 mm (produced by Hitachi Kasei Kyogyo K. K.) Mobile phase: An aqueous solution of 5 mmol/L p-toluenesulfonic acid Reaction solution: An aqueous solution obtained by diluting p-toluenesulfonic acid with water to yield a p-toluenesulfonic acid concentration of 5 mmol/L, and containing 20 mmol/L of Bis-Tris and 0.1 mmol/L of EDTA Flow rate: Mobile phase: 0.8 mL/min.; reaction solution: 0.8 mL/min. Column temperature: 45° C. Injection volume: 10 μL [Experiment 1] Different beverage samples prepared by diluting liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with milk were investigated for the relationship between acetic acid concentration and the intensities of kokumi, bitterness and aroma. First, liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee were prepared. A caffeine extract (produced by Shiratori Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and a commercial coffee flavoring comprising pyrazines were added to ion-exchange water to give a liquid concentrate of low-caffeine coffee having such final concentrations of caffeine and coffee flavoring as indicated in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 1. Further, varied amounts of acetic acid powder (produced by Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was added to prepare liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee having such different acetic acid concentrations as shown in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 1. When the pH fell below 5.0, the pH was adjusted to from 5.0 to 5.5 with sodium hydrogen carbonate. These liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee having different acetic acid concentrations were diluted with milk by five times (coffee-flavored liquid:milk=1:4) to obtain different latte-flavored beverages having a caffeine concentration of 2 mg/100 g and a coffee solids concentration of 0%. The obtained latte-flavored beverage samples were subjected to sensory evaluation by five trained professional panelists. With a sample prepared with no addition of acetic acid (sample No. 1-1) being used as a control, the samples were rated on whether they tasted close to latte, i.e., a mixed beverage of espresso and milk. To be specific, the individual panelists on their own first evaluated the samples on the kokumi taste (i.e., whether pronounced coffee richness was felt), bitterness (i.e., whether pronounced coffee bitterness was felt), and aroma (i.e., whether pronounced coffee aroma was felt) of coffee. Those samples evaluated by all the five panelists as being closer in flavor to latte than the control were rated as “∘”, those evaluated by 3 or 4 panelists as being closer in flavor to latte than the control were rated as “Δ”, and those evaluated by 2 or less panelists as being closer in flavor to latte than the control (including those evaluated by all the panelists as being similar in flavor to the control) were rated as “x”. The results are shown in Table 1. When latte-flavored beverage samples prepared by 5-fold dilution with plenty of milk contained acetic acid at concentrations of not less than 1 mg/100 g, they were closer in flavor to latte, with the mellow and thick mouthfeel characteristic of milk, and the tastes (kokumi and bitterness) and aroma (esp., nut-like aroma) of coffee being enhanced with an increase of acetic acid concentration.

First, different liquid coffee concentrates were prepared by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1, except that caffeine was added to give such varied concentrations as indicated in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Tables 2-1 to 2-4. The prepared liquid coffee concentrates were diluted with milk by five times, and the diluted beverages were subjected to sensory evaluation by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1, with those acetic acid-free samples with different caffeine concentrations (sample Nos. 2-1, 2-4, 2-7, 2-10, 2-13, 2-16, 2-19, 2-22) being used as controls. The results are shown in Table 2. In those diluted beverage samples with a caffeine concentration of less than 0.1 mg/100 g (sample Nos. 2-2, 2-3, 2-5, 2-6), no enhancement of coffee tastes and aroma by acetic acid was observed. Also, in those diluted beverage samples with a caffeine concentration exceeding 10 mg/100 g (sample Nos. 2-20, 2-21), no enhancement of coffee tastes and aroma by acetic acid was observed, since these samples had adequate coffee flavor even in the absence of acetic acid. These results revealed that in order that the effects of the present invention can be effectively exhibited, caffeine is required to be present at a concentration sufficient to yield a diluted beverage with a caffeine concentration of from 0.1 to 10 mg/100 g.

Phosphoric acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate were added in appropriate amounts to sample No. 1-5 (pH 5.5) as prepared in Experiment 1 to give different liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with different pH values of from 4.0 to 7.5. Different control samples with different pH values were also prepared with no addition of acetic acid. The liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee and control samples prepared above were diluted with milk by five times and subjected to sensory evaluation by following the same procedures as in Experiment 1. Those liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with a pH of less than 5.0 flocculated and aggregated when mixed with milk. In these samples, no pronounced enhancement of caffeine tastes was observed even with addition of acetic acid—this is presumably because as aggregation progressed, coffee tastes and aroma became less perceivable. With regard to those liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with a pH exceeding 7.0, the beverage samples prepared from those liquid concentrates were indistinct in overall tastes and less noticeable in coffee and milk tastes, and many of the panelists evaluated that no significant enhancement of caffeine tastes by addition of acetic acid was observed like in the case of those liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with a pH of from 5.0 to 6.0 or from 5.3 to 6.0, although some of the panelists evaluated that these beverage samples had an enhanced coffee sensation. [Experiment 4] Different beverage samples prepared by dilution with milk of liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee prepared from a mixture of a liquid coffee extract and a coffee flavoring were investigated for the relationship between acetic acid concentration and the intensities of kokumi, bitterness and aroma. First, a liquid extract of low-caffeine coffee was prepared. To be specific, commercial roasted coffee beans (L-value 18) decaffeinated by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction were employed and treated with steam by following the procedure disclosed in Example 3 of Japanese Domestic Re-publication of PCT International Publication No. JPWO 2005-11396, thereby to obtain decaffeinated, steamed and roasted coffee beans. The obtained roasted coffee beans were ground to medium grind, loaded into a multistage column extractor, and extracted in a multistep process with addition of hot water to obtain a liquid coffee extract with a Brix (i.e., coffee solids concentration) of 12%. The obtained liquid coffee extract was diluted with water to give a liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5%. This liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5% was used as a liquid coffee concentrate base to make different liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with a coffee solids concentration of 5%. To be specific, the above prepared liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5%, acetic acid as used in Experiment 1, and a coffee flavoring comprising pyrazines (different from the one used in Experiment 1) were mixed according to the prescriptions shown in Table 3-1, and adjusted to pH 5.3 to 6.0 with sodium hydrogen carbonate to prepare different liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee (sample Nos. 4-1 to 4-7) containing the different components in such amounts as shown in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 3-1. In order to provide a control sample, 9 mg/100 g of caffeine and 0.3 g/100 g of the above coffee flavoring were added to ion-exchange water to prepare a control liquid concentrate sample of low-caffeine coffee which contained no liquid coffee extract but had the same caffeine and coffee flavoring concentrations. The liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee with different acetic acid concentrations, and the control liquid concentrate sample of low-caffeine coffee as prepared above were diluted with milk by four times (liquid coffee concentrate:milk=1:3) to obtain different latte-flavored beverage samples. Separately, the liquid coffee extract with a coffee solids concentration of 5% was mixed with 20 mg/100 g of caffeine used in Experiment 1 and further with the above coffee flavoring to prepare different liquid concentrate samples of high-caffeine coffee (sample Nos. 4-8 to 4-10) containing the different components in such amounts as shown in the “Liquid concentrate” row of Table 3-2. Further, as a control sample, a liquid concentrate of high-caffeine coffee containing no liquid coffee extract but having the same caffeine and coffee flavoring concentrations was prepared. The liquid concentrate samples of high-caffeine coffee with different acetic acid concentrations, and the control liquid concentrate sample of high-caffeine coffee as prepared above were diluted with milk by four times (liquid coffee concentrate:milk=1:3) to obtain different latte-flavored beverage samples. The above-prepared latte-flavored beverages were subjected to sensory evaluation in comparison with the control beverage samples with the same caffeine and coffee flavoring concentrations, by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1. The results are shown in Tables 3-1 and 3-2. When the liquid concentrate samples of low-caffeine coffee containing caffeine at low concentrations sufficient to yield diluted beverages having a caffeine concentration within the range of from 1 to 10 mg/100 g (e.g., 2.3 mg/100 mg) were adapted by adjusting the concentration of acetic acid (B) to a concentration sufficient to yield diluted beverages having an acetic acid (B) concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g, and by adjusting the ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range of from 0.7 to 11, the latte-flavored beverage samples prepared by diluting these liquid concentrate samples had noticeable and pronounced coffee richness and bitterness, and also had an aroma reminiscent of mellow coffee like espresso. From these results combined with the results in Table 2, it was found to be preferable to adjust the concentration ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range of from 0.7 to 25.

These liquid coffee extracts with coffee solids concentrations of 2%, 9% and 12% were respectively used as liquid coffee concentrate bases to make different liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with coffee solids concentrations of 2%, 9% and 12%. To be specific, by following the same procedure as in Experiment 4, these liquid coffee extracts with different coffee solids concentrations were mixed with a coffee flavoring and varied concentrations of acetic acid according to the prescriptions indicated in Tables 4-1 and 4-2, whereby different liquid concentrates of low-caffeine coffee with different coffee solids and acetic acid concentrations were obtained. The obtained liquid concentrates were diluted with milk by four times, and subjected to sensory evaluation by following the same procedure as in Experiment 1. The results are shown in Tables 4-1 and 4-2. When the liquid coffee concentrate samples containing caffeine derived from a liquid coffee extract at low concentrations sufficient to yield diluted beverages having a caffeine concentration of from 1 to 10 mg/100 g were adapted by adjusting the concentration of acetic acid (B) to a concentration sufficient to yield diluted beverages having an acetic acid (B) concentration of not less than 1 mg/100 g, and by adjusting the ratio of acetic acid (B) and caffeine (A) [(B)/(A)] to be within the range of from 0.7 to 25, especially from 3 to 15, the latte-flavored beverage samples prepared from these liquid concentrate samples had noticeable and pronounced coffee richness and bitterness, and also had an aroma reminiscent of mellow coffee like espresso. FIG. 1 depicts a diagram that summarizes the results in Experiments 4 and 5. In this FIGURE, the filled circles “●” represent beverages evaluated by the professional panelists as having particularly noticeable coffee richness and bitterness. The panelists evaluated that these latte-flavored beverages gave a long coffee aftertaste after swallowing, and left pleasant coffee kokumi and bitter tastes that lingered in the mouth for a long time.

A common form of ADC coffee maker includes a housing for a cold water compartment, a warmer plate, an ADC heater and pump assembly, and a brew basket or the like. Cold water in the cold water compartment is heated and pumped through an up tube or riser to a spreader tube and poured into the brew basket where it engages coffee grounds previously placed in the basket, forms brewed coffee, and drains into a separate coffee container or carafe that is removably positioned on the warmer plate. Coffee brewed in this manner is generally preferred to percolator brewed coffee, apparently because the freshly heated hot water passes only once through the coffee grounds whereas, in a percolator, partly brewed coffee recycles through the coffee grounds. An object of this invention is to provide an ADC coffee maker which does not have a separate carafe. Rather, the coffee maker is a single unit in the sense that all of its parts, including the carafe, are in one housing so that it may be carried about and stored in the same manner as an ordinary percolator. Various suggestions and attempts have been made to provide such an ADC coffee maker. However, the known coffee makers of this type have been designed so that they would be excessively large in relation to the amount of coffee that may be brewed at any one time, either in a vertical or in a horizontal direction, or quite expensive, or quite complex and unreliable. A further object of this invention is to provide such a single-unit ADC coffee maker which is relatively inexpensive, attractively styled, convenient and safe to use, and easy to clean. Another object of this invention is to provide such a single-unit ADC coffee maker having a housing molded from a thermoplastic material having compartments for containing both the cold water and the brewed coffee, wherein a single ADC heater and pump assembly is used to heat the cold water for brewing and for maintaining the brewed coffee warm after brewing. A related object is to provide such a coffee maker in which the thermoplastic material in the area of the ADC heater and pump assembly is not heated to the extent that it may soften and lose its shape. Also, it is an object to provide such a coffee maker wherein the brewed coffee compartment is in a container comprising a thermoplastic, cylindrical member open at its upper end and closed at its lower end by a metal warmer plate. Although several thermoplastic materials may be used, polypropylene is presently considered to be the material of choice. An ADC heater and pump assembly is preferably mounted on the bottom of the warmer plate and the warmer plate preferably comprises a stainless steel plate seamed in liquid tight relationship to the bottom of the cylindrical, thermoplastic body member. Another object of this invention is to provide an ADC coffee maker having a brewed coffee container located within a cold water compartment wherein the brewed coffee stays warm over relatively long periods of time if its heater is disconnected from a source of electricity and wherein the outside of the coffee maker housing remains relatively cool so that it may be safely and comfortably handled. To this end, the brewed coffee container is surrounded partly by the cold water compartment and otherwise substantially surrounded by dead air space. During the brewing process, the cold water compartment is emptied so that the freshly brewed coffee is substantially completely surrounded by dead air spaces and thereby insulated from the outer wall of the coffee maker. Briefly, an ADC coffee maker in accordance with this invention has a brewed coffee container located within a housing, the brewed coffee container having a pour spout at its upper end extending upwardly and outwardly to the outside of the coffee maker. The brewed coffee container is formed from a thin-walled, generally cylindrical plastic body member open at its upper end and closed at its lower end by a metal warmer plate, the outer margin of which is seamed to the bottom of the plastic body member. An ADC heater and pump assembly is mounted on the underside of the warmer plate. The coffee maker further includes a brew basket removably mounted in the upper end of the brewed coffee container. A removable lid is provided to permit access to the portion of the housing containing the brewed coffee container to permit access to the brew basket and the brewed coffee container. A cold water compartment having a fill port adjacent the brew basket surrounds part of the brewed coffee container. The fill port is located within a cold water compartment cover panel that spans between the upper end of the brewed coffee container and a wall of a housing that houses the cold water compartment and the brewed coffee container. Removal of the lid also provides access to the cold water fill port. A hot water spreader or spigot is provided for delivering water pumped through hot water delivery means from the ADC pump to the brew basket. The spigot is pivotal about a generally vertical axis so that it may be pivoted to a position wherein it does not interfere with the removal of the brew basket means. The coffee maker housing is so constructed that, after the cold water has been pumped from the cold water compartment, the brewed coffee container is substantially completely surrounded by dead air spaces which insulate the brewed coffee container from the outer walls portions of the coffee maker. Means are provided for restricting heat losses through the spout and also to prevent substantial spillage of brewed coffee or coffee grounds if the coffee maker is accidentally upset. In the presently preferred embodiment of this invention, the housing comprises a thermoplastic upper housing member and a thermoplastic lower housing member that are bonded together to form and enclose the cold water compartment and also to form all of the brewed coffee container except for the warmer plate which closes its lower end. A hollow handle may form part of the cold water compartment. Still a further object of this invention is to provide an improved brew basket especially adapted for use with an ADC coffee maker. In accordance with this invention, the brew basket comprises a cup-like body for receiving a filter and fresh coffee grounds and having means at its upper end for deriving support from a brewed coffee container. The floor of the brew basket slopes downwardly from front to rear and a coffee drain port is at the rearward end of the floor. The floor has side edges converging from a maximum separation at its front end to a lesser separation at its rearward end. By proper selection of the slope of the floor and its width, the proper pressure head of brewed coffee is formed for the desired rate of flow of the brewed coffee through the drain port. The brew basket further comprises a baffle along the upper front margin thereof to protect against coffee grounds falling out of the basket when brewed coffee is being poured. Other objects, advantages, and features of the invention will become apparent from the following description, the claims, and the accompanying drawings.

After brewing coffee in the coffee maker 10 as will be described below, the power cord 12 may be unplugged from the utility outlet and the coffee maker 10 may then be carried about as shown in FIG. 2. In accordance with this invention, the coffee maker 10 will tend to maintain the brewed coffee warm for extended periods of time, even if unplugged, so that one may brew coffee at one location, such as a household kitchen countertop, and then move the coffee maker 10 to another location, such as a dining room table for serving guest. With continued reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, and with reference also to FIG. 3 the coffee maker 10 comprises an upper housing member 14 including a first, vertically extending, generally tubular housing portion 16 having an outer wall 16A and constructed to be closed by a lid 18. Upper housing member 14 further includes a carrying handle 20 spaced from the tubular housing portion 16. Coffee maker 10 further comprises a lower housing member 22 having a cup-like, upwardly facing cover member 24. A coffee maker base 26 supports the lower housing cover member 24 which in turn supports the housing members 14 and 22. The assembled housing members 14 and 22 are compartmented to form a cold water compartment, generally designated 28, and a brewed coffee compartment, generally designated 30. Brewed coffee compartment 30 is located within a brewed coffee container 32 comprising a thin-walled body formed generally as a right circular cylinder from an internal, upper cylindrical wall 34 inside the upper housing member 14 and an internal, lower cylindrical wall 36 forming part of the lower housing 22. Cylindrical walls 34 and 36 are bonded together as will be described below. The bottom of the brewed coffee container 32 is formed by a circular warmer plate 38 having its outer margin seamed, as by rolling, onto the bottom edge of the lower cylindrical container wall 36 in liquid tight relation thereto. Cold water compartment 28 surrounds part of the brewed coffee container 32 and is bounded by the outer wall of the upper housing member 14 and, at its bottom end, by a cold water compartment base wall 40 that forms part of the lower housing member 22 and that extends generally transversely to the cylindrical wall 36. The cold water compartment is formed generally into three sections by the outer wall portions of the upper housing member 14, namely a first, vertically extending, generally tubular section 28A formed by the first housing portion 16 and around the upper portion of the brewed coffee container 32, a second section 28B spaced from the first section 28A and located within the handle 20, and a third section 28C merging with and interconnecting the lower end portions of the first and said second sections 28A and 28B. Third section 28 is located beneath a connecting wall portion, designated 42, of the upper housing member 14 spanning between the first housing section 16 and the handle 20. The connecting wall portion 42 is of a sufficient horizontal extent that the handle 20 is so remote from the first housing portion 16 that one' s fingers may be conveniently wrapped around the handle 20 as shown in FIG. 2. The handle 20 is formed as a hollow, thin-walled, vertically projecting post. Preferably, its upper end is connected to the upper end of the first housing portion 16 by a stiffening rib 44 that rigidifies the handle 20 and cooperates therewith to assist one in carrying the coffee maker 10. To prevent an air lock in the cold water compartment section 28C, and thereby permit it to be filled with cold water, an air vent opening 46 extends through the upper wall of the handle 20. A pour spout 48 extends from the upper end of the brewed coffee compartment 30 upwardly and outwardly of the surrounding wall portions of the outer wall 16A of the first housing portion 16. Pour spout 48 forms an upwardly opening trough for pouring brewed coffee out of the brewed coffee container 32. Its margins merge both into the wall of the brewed coffee container 32 and into the outer wall 16A. To improve the pouring characteristics of the pour spout 48, its wall tapers to a thinner thickness at its upper end. Referring to FIGS. 3, 4 and 5, an arcuately extending cover panel 50 spans between the uppermost end of the brewed coffee container 32 and the inside surface, designated 16B, of the outer wall 16A of the first housing portion 16. Cover panel 50 is substantially planar except that it has a recessed cold water-fill port 52 opening to the cold water compartment 28. Fill port 52 is interrupted by plural bars 54 that form a grill to prevent large objects from entering the cold water compartment 28. An optical level indicator 56 is provided having four transparent, indicator rods 58, which may be made from a clear polycarbonate plastic, depending from the cover panel 50 into the cold water compartment 28. As known to those familiar with indicators of this type, when the water level within the cold water compartment section 28A reaches a given indicator rod 58, the appearance of the top of the rod changes so that the water level is indicated. For convenience, the top plate of the indicator 56 may be marked in cup units. Referring to FIGS. 3, 5, and 9, a removable, cup-like brew basket 60 is provided having a peripherally extending, outwardly projecting flange 62 along its upper margin. In use, flange 62 is adapted to rest upon the cover panel 50 and thereby suspend the brew basket 60 in the upper end of the brewed coffee compartment 30. Brew basket 60 is circular at its upper end and has downwardly and inwardly sloping walls 60A. The basket 60 has several features of interest. For purposes of this application, the spout-located margin of the coffee maker 10 is treated as the ""front"" of the coffee maker 10 and the handle 20 is considered to be at the ""rear"" of the coffee maker 10. The brew basket 60 is provided with a locating tab 64 depending from the extreme front end edge of the flange 62 which projects into the spout 48 between spaced parts of the cover panel 50 in order to properly orient the brew basket within the brewed coffee container 32. Proper orientation of the brew basket 60 is needed because it has a planar, sloping floor or drain pan 66 with side edges 68 converging from a maximum separation toward the front to a lesser separation toward the rear. Floor 66 also slopes downwardly from front to rear as seen best in FIG. 5. A brewed coffee drain port 70 opens at the rear of the floor 66 to the brewed coffee compartment 30. By virtue of this construction, an appropriate pressure head and flow rate of the brewed coffee through the drain port 70 can be obtained. The precise slope angle and the size of the floor 66 will depend on the characteristics of the ADC pump being used and other factors, and may be determined by experiment. The rearward location of the drain port 70 is further advantageous in that, when the coffee maker 10 is tilted to pour coffee out through the spout 48, the coffee inside the brewed coffee container 32 will not enter the drain port 70 and mix with the used coffee grounds, whereas that could happen if the drain port were located nearer the spout. Proper orientation of the brew basket 60 is also important because it has a baffle or guard 72 extending above and arcuately along the upper, front part of the flange 62. With this construction, the baffle 72 prevents coffee grounds from accidentally spilling out of the brew basket 60 when coffee is being poured. To avoid an accidental overflow of hot water, perhaps with loose coffee grounds, into the cold water fill port 52, an overflow slot 74 is located along a wall portion of the brew basket 60. Such an overflow could be caused by an unexpected clogging of the drain port 70, and, if permitted to enter the cold water compartment section 28C, could cause excessive heating of the coffee maker housing adjacent the handle 20 and perhaps also could damage the ADC pump. Because of the overflow slot 74, any overflow will fall harmlessly into the brewed coffee container 32. The brew basket 60 is used with replaceable coffee filters 76 (one being shown in FIG. 3) made from paper or the like material and that restrict the flow of water to the brew basket floor 66. The sidewalls and floor 66 of the brew basket 60 are provided with upstanding ridges or ribs 78 that support the filter 76 above the floor 66. The flow rate of hot water to the filter 76 relative to the flow rate of water through the filter 76 and the coffee grounds deposited therein is preferably such that the hot water pools in the coffee grounds and seeps relatively slowly downwardly therethrough. As a convenience, the bottom outer surface of the brew basket 60 may be provided with depending lugs or feet 80 so that the basket, when removed from the coffee maker housing, may be stood upright on a support surface. With reference to FIGS. 3, 5, 8 and 14, an ADC heater and pump assembly, generally designated 90, is provided for heating water drawn from the cold water compartment 28 and pumping it to the brew basket 60. The heater and pump assembly 90 may be of essentially conventional construction and includes a heating element 92 mounted on top of a pump chamber 94 in a common, U-shaped housing 96. The ADC heater and pump assembly 90 is mounted on the underside of the warmer plate 38 by a clamping assembly comprising a threaded stud 98 connected, as by welding, integrally with the warming plate 38 and depending centrally therefrom. The clamping assembly further comprises a clamp plate 100 having an outer, arcuate channel 102 for receiving and holding the lower part of the heater and pump assembly 90 and a central aperture 104 through which the stud 98 depends. A lock nut 106 threaded on the stud 98 is drawn tightly against the bottom of the clamp plate 100 to hold the heater and pump assembly 90 securely against the bottom of the warmer plate 38 in good heat exchanging relationship therewith. Here it may be noted that the coffee maker base 26 has a central, raised portion forming a recess 108 beneath the base 26 with a centrally located aperture 110 through which the threaded stud extends, and that the base 26 is held to the remwmng parts of the coffee maker 10 by a lock nut 112 located within the recess 108 and threaded onto the stud 98. Electrical power is supplied to the ADC heater and pump assembly 90 by a male receptacle 120 mounted in the rear portion of the base 26 and having rearwardly extending prongs for connection to the power cord 12 and forwardly extending prongs for internal wiring (not shown) connected to the heating element 92 and other electrical circuit components to be described. The electrical circuit, shown in FIG. 14, may be conventional and comprises a thermostat 122 in series with the heating element 92, and a small neon light 124 in series with a resistor motor 126, both of which are connected in parallel relation to the heating element 92 and the thermostat 122. A thermal fuse or cut off device 128 may be located in the hot line for protection of the coffee maker in the event excessive heat is generated. The thermostat 122 and the fuse 128 may be held tightly against the heater and pump assembly housing 96 by a U-shaped spring clamp 130. Room for the spring clamp 130 and the thermostat 122 is provided by a cutout 132 in the clamp plate 100. The neon light 124 may be held in a slotted holder 134 in the coffee maker base 26 and exposed through a lens 136 extending through an aperture in one side of the base 26. The flow of water from the cold water compartment 28 to the ADC heater and pump assembly 90 and the flow of hot water (and associated steam) from the ADC heater and pump assembly 90 to the brew basket 60 is accomplished by a first, cold water conduit in the form of a flexible cold water supply hose or elbow 140 clamped by a first hose clamp 142 at its upper end to a depending, hollow, water exit tube 144 formed integrally with and depending from the cold water compartment base wall 40 and clamped by a second hose clamp 142 at its lower end to the ADC heater and pump assembly housing 96 so as to be in liquid communication with the pump chamber 94. To insure that the cold water compartment is fully emptied with each use of the coffee maker 10, its base wall 40 slopes so that the water exit tube 144 is at its lowest point. A ball check valve assembly 146 located within the cold water supply elbow 140 which closes in response to pressure created by the water being heated in the pump chamber 94 to prevent, in known fashion, the flow of heated water back into the cold water compartment 28. Hot water conduit means is provided for delivering hot water from the pump chamber 94 to the brew basket 60. With reference to FIGS. 3, 5, and 8, such hot water conduit means comprises an up tube or riser 150 extending vertically through the rear of the first section 28A of the cold water compartment 28. The lower end of the up tube 150 is supported by the top surface of the cold water compartment base wall 40 and is aligned with a hollow, hot water delivery tube 154 depending from the base wall 40 to which hot water is supplied from the pump chamber 94 by a flexible hose or elbow 156 connected by hose clamps 158 to the heater and pump housing 96 and to the hot water delivery tube 154. Alignment of the up tube 150 with the hot water delivery tube 154 is maintained by a gasket-retaining sleeve 162 that projects upwardly from the cold water compartment base wall 40 and by a small, tubular rubber gasket 164 confined therein in the bore of which the lower end of the up tube 150 is received. The hot water conduit means further comprises a spreader or spigot, generally designated 166, that includes a hollow, horizontally extending tube portion 168 and a downwardly extending bearing sleeve 170 connected to the proximal end of the tube portion 168 and journalled for rotation within a vertical spigot-mounting sleeve 172 formed integrally with the cover panel 50 and axially aligned with the hot water delivery tube 154. The inside of the bearing sleeve 170 has a neck portion snugly engaging the upper end of the up tube 150 to form a seal there around preventing hot water from flowing downwardly into the cold water compartment 28. The bearing sleeve 170 is axially slotted to provide spring fingers 174 terminating at their lower ends in radially outwardly projecting flanges 176 which underlie the spigot-mounting sleeve 172 and cooperate with a shoulder 168A on the proximal end of the horizontally extending spigot tube portion 168 to axially confine the spigot 166 but permit pivotal movement of the spigot 166 about the axis of the up tube 150. Water heated by the ADC heater and pump assembly 90 flows upwardly through the up tube 150, through the proximal end of the spigot 166, horizontally along the spigot tube portion 168 and then downwardly through a drain opening 178 in its distal end into the brew basket 60 or, more precisely, into the filter 76 in the brew basket 60. Pivotal movement of the spigot 166 is provided so that it may be moved out of the way to enable convenient removal of the brew basket 60 or the filter 76. However, the range of pivotal movement of the spigot 166 is limited, the extreme ends of the range being indicated by the phantom lines 166A and 166B in FIG. 4. To limit the range, the vertical spigot mounting sleeve 172 is cut away to provide a pair of vertically extending, circumferentially spaced stop edges 180. A stop dog 182 is located on the spigot 166 for engaging one or the other of the stop edges 180 to prevent movement of the spigot 166 beyond the permitted range. In FIG. 4, it will be noted that the pivotal movement of the spigot is so limited that its distal end is either over the brew basket 60 or else over a portion of the cover panel 50 remote from the cold water fill port 52. Accordingly, should the coffee maker 10 be accidentally operated with the spigot in its out-of-the-way position 166B, the hot water will not enter the cold water compartment 28. Further to this end, a barrier in the form of a rib 184 upstanding from the cover panel 50 along the edge of the cold water fill port 52 nearest the proximal end of the spigot 166 is provided to prevent any hot water that may flow along the cover panel 50 from entering the cold water compartment 28. Turning attention to FIGS. 3 through 7 and 11 through 13, the lid 18 comprises a recessed center panel portion 200 adapted to cover the brew basket 60 and the cover panel 50 and further comprises an inverted U-shaped, ovate, flanged rim 202 from which a skirt 204 depends. Rim 202 engages the correspondingly ovate, upper edge of the first housing section 16. Four circumferentially spaced locking tabs 208 project outwardly from the skirt 204 and enter cooperating recess 210 in the inside wall portion 16B to securely maintain the lid 18 in place. The recesses 210 have sloping upper walls 212 that cooperate with sloping outer surfaces 208A and 208B on the locking tabs 208 to assist in guiding the locking tabs 208 into the recesses 210 and to maintain them therein. The locking tabs 208 are partly bounded by slots to enable them to flex inwardly as required to permit them to ride over the sloping recess walls 212 when the lid is placed on or removed from the coffee maker 10. With this construction, the lid 18 is securely locked in place and will tend to remain in place even if the coffee maker is accidentally upset. A cut-out 214 interrupts the skirt 204 adjacent its rearward end, the cut-out 214 being provided to prevent obstruction by the spigot 166. (If space permitted, the cut-out 214 would not be needed.) The forward end of the skirt 204 is also interrupted because it is not needed in the area of the spout 48. Rather, a tongue-like baffle 216 extends downwardly from the rim 202 into the spout 48 to partly close the opening of the spout 48 and thereby restrict the heat lost from the brewed coffee compartment 30 through the spout 49. Also, the rate with which coffee would pour out of an upset coffee maker is thereby minimized. Further in this regard, the forward portion of the skirt 204 closely overlies the brew basket flange 62. Therefore, the front portion of the brew basket is partly confined by the lid 18, which further protects against the loss of liquid or coffee grounds if the coffee maker is upset. An advantage of having the cold water compartment 28 partly surround the brewed coffee container 32 is that the dead air space left surrounding the brewed coffee container 32 after the cold water has been pumped out of the cold water compartment 28 provides thermal insulation between the brewed coffee container 32 and the outside wall of the coffee maker 10. The lower housing cover provides another dead air space that surrounds the lower end of the brewed coffee container 32. The dead air spaces serve to maintain the heated temperature of the brewed coffee and also to keep the outside wall of the coffee maker 10 relatively cool. Further to this end, as shown in FIG. 7 and by phantom lines in FIGS. 3 and 4, the lid 18 is provided with a depending, thin-walled baffle 218 bounding the area above the cold water fill port 52 to impede hot air or steam rising from the brew basket 60 from entering the cold water fill port 52. An upwardly projecting handle, generally designated 220, is located centrally of the lid 18. Lid handle 220 preferably comprises a box-like structure which is hollow, again to provide a dead air space so that it will be relatively cool. Thus, the lid handle 220 is formed from an ovate, vertical wall 222 and an ovate top plate 224. Top plate 224 is preferably slightly larger in horizontal extent than the wall 222 to provide an outwardly projecting peripheral lip that enables one to obtain a firm grip on the lid handle 220. The lid 18 is provided with a spigot-positioning gusset 226 shown in FIGS. 7 and 10, and by phantom lines in FIG. 4, extending inwardly from the lid skirt 204. The gusset 226 has a sloping lower edge surface and is so located that, if the spigot 166 is in its out-of-the-way position 166B when one attempts to put the lid 18 on the top of the housing, the gusset 226 cammingly forces the spigot 166 away from its out-of-the-way position 166B. Accordingly, when the lid 18 is in place, the spigot 166 will assuredly be located with its distal end over the brew basket 60. Here it may be noted that the brew basket could be improperly located within the brewed coffee container notwithstanding its locating tab 64. However, the locating tab 64 would then rest on the cover panel 50 and cause the top of the brew basket to be cocked at an angle and, in most instances, the brew basket 60 would interfere with the movement of the spigot 166 away from its out-of-the-way position 166B. Such condition would be immediately evident when one attempts to put on the lid 18. Thus, in view of the provision of the brew basket locating tab 64 and the spigot positioning gusset 226, it is unlikely that the coffee maker 10 would be operated with either the brew basket 60 or the spigot 166 improperly positioned. The upper housing member 14 and the lower housing member 22 are preferably made from a suitable thermoplastic material. Although other thermoplastics may be used, polypropylene is the presently preferred material because it is inexpensive and also because it is sufficiently pliant that the warmer plate 38 may be rolled onto the lower edge of the lower container portion 36 without breaking the plastic. For economy of manufacture by injection molding techniques, it is preferred that the lower cylindrical wall 36 of the brewed coffee container 32 be integrally molded with the cold water compartment base wall 40 as illustrated in FIG. 3. With this construction there is no danger of leakage of the cold water around the brewed coffee container 32 so that the expense and complications of providing a seal around the brewed coffee container 32 are avoided. Further to avoid the need for seals or the like, the upper and lower housing members 14 and 22 are bonded together in air and liquid tight relation. Preferably, they have mating tongue and groove connections along their confronting outside and inside edges. Thus, an upwardly facing continuous groove 230 extends along the outer, upper margin of the lower housing 22 and a mating, continuous depending tongue 232 extends along the outer, lower margin of the upper housing 14. Similarly, an upwardly facing continuous groove 234 extends along the inner, upper margin of the lower housing member 22 and a continuous depending tongue 236 extends along the inner, lower margin of the upper housing 14. These parts may advantageously be permanently joined by known magnetic induction welding, fusion welding, or vibration welding techniques. When the upper and lower housing members are made from polypropylene and induction welding is used, a ribbon (not shown) of polypropylene filled with iron particles is placed in the grooves 232 and 234 prior to bonding. The ribbon and the mating parts of the tongues and grooves fuse with one another into an integral matrix upon the subsequent application of magnetic induction forces. With reference to FIGS. 3 and 8, and with further regard to the assembly of the parts, the lower housing 22 may have a pair of depending connecting pins 238 adapted to interfit apertures 240 in the lower housing cover 24 to secure proper alignment therebetween. After assembly of the lower housing cover 24 onto the lower housing 22, the lower end of the connecting pins 238 may be staked by heat and pressure to secure the lower housing 22 and the cover 24 together. The upper edge of the lower housing cover member 24 also fits within a downwardly facing notch in the outer periphery of the lower housing member 22 as illustrated in FIG. 5. Alignment of the coffee maker base 26 with the lower housing cover 24 is maintained by interfitting slotted members 242 depending from the lower housing cover 24 and gussets 244 in the base 26. An important aspect of the coffee maker of this invention resides in the fact that the heating of the warmer plate 38 does not result in a heating of the lower end of the thermoplastic lower body member 22 to a temperature which would cause it to soften to the extent that it could lose its shape and jeopardize the integrity of the entire coffee maker. This benefit obtains primarily from the construction of the warmer plate and from the fact that the ADC heater and pump assembly 90 is clamped directly and centrally to the underside of the warmer plate 38 with the heater element side of the ADC heater and pump assembly housing 96 directly engaging the warmer plate in good heat-exchanging relation therewith. Heat generated by the ADC heater and pump assembly 90 is readily conducted through the thin stainless steel plate 38 but, because stainless steel is a relatively poor heat conductor and because the plate 38 has a surface area which is quite large in relation to its thickness, a substantially lesser temperature is created at the outer margin of the piate 38 than in the area of the heater and pump assembly 90. Further to minimize the heat generated at the margin of the plate 38, it is made non-planar to increase its surface area, and thus the effective distance along the plate from the points of connection of the ADC heater and pump assembly housing 96 to the outer margin of the plate 38. This may be done as shown in FIGS. 3 and 5 wherein the plate 38 is shown to have an upwardly sloping, annular panel portion 38A that extends further from the plane of the center panel than is needed to form the outer recess, designated 38B, which receives the lower margin of the lower container wall 36. If difficulty in heat build-up is encountered, the plate could be formed with ""waves"" (not shown) of upwardly and downwardly sloping annular panels similar to the panel 38B. The center of the warmer plate may be raised as indicated at 38C or otherwise formed to a non-planar configuration to increase its rigidity and thereby its resistance to becoming deformed when the coffee maker is assembled. The heat level generated by the heater and pump assembly 90 in the base 26 is higher than would be acceptable if the base were made from most common thermoplastic materials. Accordingly, the base 26 is preferably made from a thermosetting phenolic resin. The lid 18, the lower housing cover 24, and the spigot 166 are preferably made from the same thermoplastic material as the upper and lower housing members 14 and 22. The method of using the coffee maker of this invention is believed apparent from the foregoing description. Briefly, one may remove the lid 18, pour water from a tap or pitcher into the fill port 52 to the desired level, as indicated by the level indicator 56, and plug the unit into a source of house current. Upon heating of the ADC heater and pump assembly 90, the water will be heated and pumped up the up tube and out the spigot over the coffee grounds until the cold water compartment 28 is emptied. At this time one may simply pour coffee out of the coffee maker into a coffee cup as if the ADC coffee maker 10 were a standard electric household percolator. The ADC heater and pump assembly 90 will continue to intermittently operate to keep the warmer plate heated so long as the unit is plugged in. However, if desired, one may unplug the unit after the brewing process has been completed and remove the coffee maker to a remote location. Because of the unique construction of the coffee maker, the heat losses from the brewed coffee container are relatively small so that the brewed coffee will remain warm for an extensive period of time after the unit is unplugged. After use, one may remove the used coffee grounds and gain access to clean the brewed coffee container 32 by simply removing the lid 18 and pivoting the spigot 166 to its out-of-the-way position 166B. The cold water compartment may be cleaned in the same manner as any conventional ADC coffee maker. Although the preferred embodiment of this invention has been described, it will be apparent that various changes may be made within the purview of the following claims.","RE34473"

However, preparing coffee is time-consuming and can be an inefficient use of time and energy (including electrical energy) when only a single cup is to be prepared. Meanwhile, coffee makers that are designed to prepare a single cup of coffee using a single-serve ground coffee container (e.g. a Keurig® K-Cup® pod) produce an enormous amount of waste that is harmful to the environment. The result of single use K-Cup type pods is that the planet is literally being destroyed. Tens of billions of pods end up in landfills annually. If the discarded pods are placed end-to-end, they would circle the globe 12 times! This means that the waste problem is growing and will grow as more companies and unless mitigated will continue to cause problems exponentially for our planet. BRIEF SUMMARY The present disclosure contemplates various systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee. An amount of liquid coffee concentrate to prepare an individual serving of coffee is packaged in a sealed container. Unlike single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods, the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate does not need to contain a filter since the process of preparing coffee from a liquid coffee concentrate involves no brewing and produces no used coffee grounds. Due to the absence of a filter and the concentrated nature of liquid coffee concentrate, the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate can be very small, for example, sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate. A single sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate can be used to prepare a serving of coffee using an existing coffee maker (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker) designed for single-serve ground coffee containers (e.g. Keurig® K-Cup® pods). An adapter may be provided for receiving the sealed container of liquid coffee concentrate and positioning the sealed container in the coffee maker. When the coffee maker is operated, an upper portion of the sealed container may be pierced by a needle of the coffee maker to allow heated water to flow into the sealed container. A lower portion of the sealed container may be pierced by a needle of the adapter or may be otherwise compromised to allow the combined liquid coffee concentrate and hot water to flow out of the sealed container and into a user's coffee cup. In accordance with one embodiment, there is a system for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure encompasses various embodiments of systems and methods for preparing an individual serving of coffee using a liquid coffee concentrate. A person wishing to make a single serving of coffee takes a sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and places it in a coffee maker 50 . The sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 may be very small (e.g. sized to contain about 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate) in comparison to single-serve ground coffee containers like Keurig® K-Cup® pods or Nespresso® capsules. The coffee maker 50 may be a Keurig®, Nespresso® or other coffee maker that is designed to be used with single-serve ground coffee containers. The sealed container 10 may be placed inside an adapter 30 that positions the sealed container 10 in the coffee maker 50 . The person then closes the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 down on the sealed container 10 , causing a needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to puncture an upper portion of the sealed container 10 and allowing heated water to flow into the sealed container 10 through the puncture hole. A needle 38 of the adapter 30 may puncture a bottom portion of the sealed container 10 , or the sealed container 10 A may be designed to burst open in the bottom portion when filled with hot water, allowing the combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to flow down into the person's coffee cup. Afterward, the sealed container 10 , which is now punctured or otherwise compromised, may be thrown away or recycled, depending on its material composition. In either case, little waste is produced because the sealed container 10 needs no internal filter and may contain only the liquid coffee concentrate, making it much smaller than a single-serve ground coffee container such as a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or a Nespresso® capsule. FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 2 are a perspective view, a side view, and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of a sealed container 10 of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and an adapter 30 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The sealed container 10 may contain an amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 for the preparation of an individual serving of coffee, e.g. 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The sealed container 10 may have a generally cylindrical body 12 as shown with a protruding cap 14 that extends laterally outward relative to the body 12 (e.g. by 2-10 mm). When the sealed container 10 is inserted into the adapter 30 , the body 12 may fit inside a recess 32 of the adapter 30 while the protruding cap 14 does not fit inside the recess 32 . In this way, the protruding cap 14 may prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 and may provide a convenient handhold for a person removing the sealed container 10 after it has been used. The sealed container 10 may be made of a recyclable or biodegradable material or combination of materials. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the sealed container 10 may include an exterior shell 16 made of a durable paper (e.g. lightweight cardboard) that is coated with an interior coating 18 such as a waterproof wax (e.g. paraffin wax), plastic (e.g. polyethylene), or parchment. For example, the body 12 and protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 may be cut, rolled, and/or folded from a sheet of the exterior shell 16 and interior coating 18 materials. The durable paper may be durable enough to allow the exterior shell 16 to maintain its form while being handled in the ordinary usage of the sealed container 10 . The body 12 and the protruding cap 14 may both include a portion of the exterior shell 16 and a portion of the interior coating 18 . The interior coating 18 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from degrading the exterior shell 16 , thus allowing the exterior shell 16 to be made from a durable paper such as cardboard. In some cases, the interior coating 18 may not be as recyclable or biodegradable as the exterior shell 16 and may instead melt off the exterior shell 16 and into the coffee as the coffee is prepared from hot water mixing with the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . In such cases, the interior coating 18 may be made of a material that is harmless when ingested and does not appreciably affect the taste of the coffee. As noted above, the sealed container 10 may contain, for example, 5-10 mL of liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The overall capacity of the sealed container 10 may be equal to the amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 contained in the sealed container 10 , or may be greater, with the remaining space filled with a quantity of air. The capacity of the sealed container 10 may range from the minimum capacity needed to contain the desired amount of liquid coffee concentrate 20 (e.g. 5 mL, but may be lower depending on the concentration of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and the desired strength of the coffee) up to a maximum capacity depending on the size of the coffee maker that the sealed container 10 will be used with. For example, if the sealed container 10 will be inserted in an adapter 30 inside a Keurig® coffee maker, a relatively large sealed container 10 may have a capacity of around 40 mL. In the interest of minimizing the size of the sealed container 10 , the capacity of the sealed container 10 may be less than 20 mL, preferably less than 15 mL, more preferably less than 10 mL. Accounting for the material(s) of the sealed container 10 itself, the sealed container 10 may have an exterior volume that is slightly greater than its capacity, where the exterior volume is defined as the total volume of liquid displaced when the sealed container 10 is submerged in the liquid. Such exterior volume may similarly range between low values around 5 mL and relatively high values around 40 mL, with the exterior volume greater than the capacity of the sealed container 10 by an amount defined by the volume displaced by the material(s) of the sealed container 10 . For example, assuming the material(s) of the sealed container 10 displace 5 mL, the exterior volume of the sealed container 10 may be less than 25 mL, preferably less than 20 mL, more preferably less than 15 mL. The recess 32 of the adapter 30 may be generally cylindrical to match the shape of the sealed container 10 and may be wider (e.g. having a greater diameter) than the sealed container 10 , except that the recess 32 may be narrower (e.g. having a smaller diameter) than the protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 . In this way, the recess 32 may be shaped to prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the adapter 30 and becoming irretrievable. The exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped to fit inside an existing coffee maker in the same way that a single-serve ground coffee container fits inside the coffee maker. Thus, for example, the exterior of the adapter 30 may be shaped like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod, a Nespresso® capsule, etc., depending on which existing coffee maker the adapter 30 is designed for. It is also contemplated that the adapter 30 may be designed to universally match two or more such existing coffee makers (e.g. by matching a height dimension of one and a width dimension of another). In some cases, an existing coffee maker may have a needle positioned to pierce a lower portion of a single-serve ground coffee container. For example, a Keurig® coffee maker may have a part known as a K-Cup® holder that functions as a recess for receiving a K-Cup® pod, and the K-Cup® holder may have a part known as an exit needle that is positioned to pierce the bottom of the K-Cup® pod at a peripheral region of the K-Cup® pod. The adapter 30 may be shaped so as to avoid touching or pressing hard against such needle as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B. In this regard, the adapter 30 may have a reduced height relative to the recess of the coffee maker, so as not to extend deeply enough into the recess to reach the needle, or the adapter 30 may have an exterior contour with a sloped or stepped region 34 in a lower portion thereof that slopes or steps inward to avoid the needle. Such reduced height and/or sloped or stepped region 34 may symmetrically define the exterior of the adapter 30 or may occur only in a portion of the adapter 30 , e.g. as a dedicated slot to receive the needle. Meanwhile, the upper portion of the adapter 30 may have an outwardly extending lip 36 that extends laterally outward from the recess 32 in the upper portion of the adapter 30 . In this way, just as the protruding cap 14 of the sealed container 10 may prevent the sealed container 10 from being inserted too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the lip 36 of the adapter may prevent the adapter 30 from being inserted too far into the recess of the coffee maker. By holding the adapter 30 at the top of the recess of the coffee maker, the lip 36 may allow the adapter 30 to avoid the needle of the coffee maker. As shown in FIG. 2, the interior of the adapter 30 may include a hollow adapter needle 38 that acts as a fluid conduit between the recess 32 of the adapter 30 and the bottom of the adapter 30 . The adapter needle 38 may have a sharp point at the top and be positioned to puncture the bottom portion of the sealed container 10 when the sealed container 10 is pressed down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . The adapter 30 may be made of a hard plastic such as polypropylene and may be manufactured by injection molding, with the adapter needle 38 made of a metal alloy such as stainless steel or carbon steel. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of the sealed container 10 and the adapter 30 with the sealed container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 . As shown in FIG. 3, the sealed container 10 may fit snugly in the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , with the recess 32 of the adapter 30 slightly larger than the sealed container 10 . In the case of a cylindrical sealed container 10 and a cylindrical recess 32 , the recess 32 may have an inner diameter that is slightly greater (e.g. 2-10 mm) than the exterior diameter of the sealed container 10 . When the sealed container 10 is placed inside the recess 32 of the adapter 30 , the sealed container 10 may initially come to rest on top of the adapter needle 38 without being punctured. In this way, the sealed container 10 may be positioned in the adapter 30 (before or after the adapter is placed inside the coffee maker) without prematurely releasing the liquid coffee concentrate 20 from the sealed container 10 . FIGS. 4A and 4B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of the sealed container 10 placed inside the adapter 30 with the adapter 30 placed inside the coffee maker 50 , with FIG. 4A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 4B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. In FIG. 4A, the sealed container 10 is resting on top of the adapter needle 38 as in FIG. 3. Meanwhile, the entire adapter 30 is positioned inside a recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The illustrated recess 52 is a K-Cup® holder as used in Keurig® coffee makers, including an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) and a funnel part 56 . As can be seen, the adapter 30 is positioned in the recess 52 so as to avoid an exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . In the example of FIGS. 4A and 4B, the full height of the adapter 30 is great enough to extend down past the tip of the exit needle 55 while the lip 36 of the adapter 30 rests on the outside of the recess 52 . In this example, the adapter 30 can still avoid the exit needle 55 due to its exterior contour having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as shown. In addition to the recess 52 (having the exit needle part 54 and the funnel part 56 ), the coffee maker 50 shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B has a lid 58 (see FIG. 4B), a water conduit 60 , a pump 62 , and a heater 64 . The water conduit 60 provides water for making a cup of coffee. For example, water from a water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed container 10 as described in more detail below. The water source 61 may be, for example, a fillable water tank of the coffee maker 60 . The pump 62 may pump the water from the water source 61 to the sealed container 10 via the water conduit 60 , and the heater 64 may heat the water. For example, the heater 64 may heat the water while the water is at the water source 61 (e.g. in a water tank) or while the water is en route to the sealed container 10 (e.g. as the water flows through piping or tubing or one or more heating tanks of the water conduit 60 ). Thus, the heater 64 may heat only the amount of water needed for an individual cup of coffee or may heat a larger batch of water. The heater 64 may be an electric heater that heats the water by Joule heating. It is also contemplated that the water source 61 may be a connection to a cold water line of a building, similar to that used by a refrigerator that has a water dispenser or ice maker. In this case, the pump 62 may be omitted as the pressure in the water line is used to bring the water to the sealed container 10 via the water conduit 60 . The lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 has an entrance needle 66 for piercing a hole in an upper portion of the sealed container 10 while the sealed container 10 is in the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . The entrance needle 66 may be hollow and act as a part of the water conduit 60 (e.g. with an upper end of the entrance needle 66 connected to tubing or piping of the water conduit 60 ). In this way, the water from the water source 61 may flow through the water conduit 60 and into the sealed container 10 through the tip of the entrance needle 66 after the entrance needle 66 punctures the hole in the sealed container 10 . To this end, the entrance needle 66 may have a sharp point at the bottom and be positioned to puncture the top portion of the sealed container 10 when the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed container 10 sitting into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . As the lid 58 is pressed down onto the sealed container 10 , a bottom face 68 of the lid 58 may abut against the sealed container 10 to press the sealed container 10 down into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . In this way, the action of the lid 58 may, in addition to causing the entrance needle 66 to pierce the upper portion of the sealed container 10 , cause the sealed container 10 to press against the tip of the adapter needle 38 so that the adapter needle 38 punctures the lower portion of the sealed container 10 . The adapter needle 38 may have an internal passage 40 with an inlet 42 near the point of the adapter needle 38 where the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed container 10 and an outlet 44 at the bottom of the adapter 30 . When the adapter needle 38 punctures the sealed container 10 , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 42 , through the internal passage 40 , and out of the outlet 44 and into the person's coffee cup where additional mixing of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may occur. Just below the inlet 42 , a gasket 46 may be provided to function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may be angled upward so as to function as a funnel that directs any fluid leaving through the puncture hole into the inlet 42 of the internal passage 40 of the adapter needle 38 . The gasket 46 may also function as a seal against the sealed container 10 . For example, the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the height of the sealed container 10 below the protruding cap 14 matches the depth of the gasket 46 within the recess 32 of the adapter 30 . More specifically, the gasket 46 may be made of a flexible material (e.g. rubber) that is capable of bending downward as the sealed container 10 presses down on it, so as to remain in contact with the sealed container 10 for a range of depths (spanning 1-5 mm, for example). The sealed container 10 and adapter 30 may be designed so that the bottom of the sealed container 10 falls within this range of depths when the protruding cap 14 rests on the adapter 30 outside the recess 32 . In this way, it may be assured that the bottom of the sealed container 10 presses against the gasket 46 , with the gasket 46 functioning as a seal between the adapter needle 38 and the sealed container 10 . The gasket 46 may thus prevent the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water from escaping around the outside of the adapter needle 38 and gasket 46 through the puncture hole created by the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 5A and 5B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 a placed inside an adapter 30 a with the adapter 30 a placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 5A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 5B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 5A and 5B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 a and adapter 30 a . The sealed container 10 a may be the same as the sealed container 10 except that the exterior shell 16 a of the sealed container 10 a includes one or more holes 17 in a lower portion thereof, with the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 . The one or more holes 17 may be used to allow a mixture of liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water to burst out from the sealed container 10 when preparing a serving of coffee. To this end, the adapter 30 a may be the same as the adapter 30 except that the adapter 30 a omits the adapter needle 38 , including, in its place, a borehole 38 a extending from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a to the bottom of the adapter 30 a . The borehole 38 a may be present in the adapter 30 as well, with the only difference being the presence of the adapter needle 38 filling the borehole 38 a in the adapter 30 . As described above, water from the water source 61 may be pressurized by the pump 62 and heated by the heater 64 as it flows through the water conduit 60 . When the heated and pressurized water flows from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 a , the added heat and/or pressure of the water shooting into the sealed container 10 a and against the bottom of the sealed container 10 a may melt or otherwise degrade the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 , allowing the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow out of the sealed container 10 a through the one or more holes 17 . Along the same lines, instead of the one or more holes 17 , the exterior shell 16 a may have a kiss cut or other perforation or weakening in the lower portion thereof (preferably bottom exterior side), in the shape of a starburst for example. In this case, the pressure of the water shooting into the sealed container 10 a may blow out the exterior shell 16 a itself, rather than only the interior coating 18 . In either case, the combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may then flow through the borehole 38 a of the adapter 30 a and down into the person's coffee cup. It should be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to burst through the interior coating 18 and/or exterior shell 16 a of the sealed container 10 a should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . In the case of the sealed container 10 a and adapter 30 a , there is no adapter needle 38 that punctures the bottom of the sealed container 10 a . Therefore, there is no danger of premature puncturing by the adapter needle 38 , and the sealed container 10 a may be completely inserted into the adapter 30 a at an initial stage as shown in FIG. 5A without needing to be pressed farther into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a by the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 . That is, the sealed container 10 a may always come to rest with the protruding cap 14 against the top of the adapter 30 a (preventing the sealed container 10 a from falling too far into the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a ) as shown in FIG. 5A, never in an elevated position resting on the adapter needle 38 as in the case of the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 as shown in FIG. 4A. FIGS. 6A and 6B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 b placed inside an adapter 30 b with the adapter 30 b placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 6A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 6B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 6A and 6B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 b and adapter 30 b . The sealed container 10 b may be the same as the sealed container 10 except that, unlike the body 12 of the sealed container 10 , the body 12 b of the sealed container 10 b has a rounded bottom 13 b . In other respects, the body 12 b may be the same as the body 12 and may be, for example, generally cylindrical like the body 12 . The rounded bottom 13 b may advantageously act as a funnel within the sealed container 10 b , aiding the flow of all of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water contained in the sealed container 10 b to the same part of the sealed container 10 b for efficient flow out of the sealed container 10 b . For example, if the adapter needle 38 is positioned to puncture the center of the sealed container 10 b , the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed container 10 b to a point at the center of the sealed container 10 b where a hole is punctured by the adapter needle 38 . Similarly, in a case where there is no adapter needle 38 and the sealed container 10 b has holes 17 or other burst-through mechanism like the sealed container 10 a of FIGS. 5A and 5B, the rounded bottom 13 b may be structured to funnel the contents of the sealed container 10 b to the vicinity of the one or more holes 17 or other mechanism. The rounded bottom 13 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed container 10 b , e.g., as it may be produced from a single sheet of material. The rounded bottom 13 b may be half-spherical or exhibit any other curvature. The rounded bottom 13 b may include portions that are not curved, such as a central flat portion allowing the sealed container 10 b to be placed upright without falling over. The sealed container 10 b may also differ from the sealed container 10 in that the sealed container 10 b may have a protruding film 14 b in place of the protruding cap 14 . The protruding film 14 b may be made of an easily puncturable material such as aluminum foil or a laminate of aluminum foil and paper or plastic, which may cause the entrance needle 66 of the coffee maker 50 to degrade less quickly as it is repeatedly used to pierce sealed containers 10 b . The protruding film 14 b may obviate the need for the interior coating 18 to extend beyond the body 12 b (e.g. to the protruding cap 14 described above), as the protruding film 14 b itself may be made of a material that is resistant to degradation caused by the liquid coffee concentrate 20 . The protruding film 14 b may also allow for easy manufacture of the sealed container 10 b , e.g. as the protruding film 14 b may be produced as a single sheet and without folded portions. The adapter 30 b may be the same as the adapter 30 or the adapter 30 a . The adapter 30 b shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B differs from the adapter 30 and 30 a to illustrate some modifications in design that may be applied to any of the adapters 30 , 30 a , 30 b . For example, the adapter 30 b has an annular depression 31 around the recess 32 in place of a sloping region of the adapters 30 and 30 a . The depression 31 is especially useful in the case of the sealed container 10 b because the protruding film 14 b may have much less height than the protruding cap 14 . Without the depression 31 , it might be difficult to retrieve the sealed container 10 b from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 b after use, since the protruding film 14 b might be almost flush against the top of the adapter 30 b . The depression 31 provides a place for a person's finger to go when grabbing the sealed container 10 b , making retrieval of the sealed container 10 b from the adapter 30 b easier. The adapter 30 b also illustrates an example in which the overall reduced height of the adapter 30 b relative to the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 , rather than the exterior contour of the adapter 30 b having a sloped or stepped region 34 , may be used to avoid the exit needle 55 of the coffee maker 50 . FIGS. 7A and 7B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 including cross-sectional views of a sealed container 10 c placed inside an adapter 30 c with the adapter 30 c placed inside the coffee maker 50 according to another embodiment of the present disclosure, with FIG. 7A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 7B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 may be the same as the coffee maker 50 described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIGS. 7A and 7B differ from FIGS. 4A and 4B in the features of the sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c . The sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be the same as the sealed container 10 and adapter 30 a except that, as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the sealed container 10 c and adapter 30 c may be shaped to take advantage of the existing exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 . As such, rather than having a sloped region 34 that slopes inward to avoid the exit needle 55 as described in relation to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the exterior contour of the adapter 30 c may remain wide enough in the vicinity of the exit needle 55 so as to allow the exit needle 55 to extend into a borehole 38 c of the adapter 30 c . In this regard, the borehole 38 c may be structurally the same as the borehole 38 a described in relation to FIGS. 5A and 5B, with the difference being its positioning in relation to the exit needle 55 . With the borehole 38 c positioned to correspond to the exit needle 55 , which is off-center, the recess 32 c may similarly be provided off-center in the adapter 30 c . More particularly, the recess 32 c may have a shape that is off-center toward the bottom while being centered in the adapter 30 c toward the top. As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, for example, the recess 32 c may have a generally upside-down L-shaped profile that diminishes in cross-sectional area from the top to the bottom of the adapter 30 c . By providing such an adapter 30 c , a correspondingly shaped sealed container 10 c may be placed in the recess 32 c such that the top of the sealed container 10 c may be punctured by a central entrance needle 66 and the bottom of the sealed container 10 c may be punctured by an off-center exit needle 55 . In this way, both the needles 66 , 55 of the existing coffee maker 50 may be used and the adapter needle 38 is not required. Heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 c through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed container 10 c through the exit needle 55 and down into the person's coffee cup. More specifically, the exit needle 55 may have an internal passage 70 with an inlet 72 near the point of the exit needle 55 where the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed container 10 c and an outlet 74 that feeds into the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 . When the exit needle 55 punctures the sealed container 10 c , a combination of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may flow into the inlet 72 , through the internal passage 70 , and out of the outlet 74 . Just below the inlet 72 , a gasket 76 may be provided to function as a seal around the exit needle 55 in the same way that the gasket 46 may function as a seal around the adapter needle 38 . FIGS. 8A and 8B are schematic representations of a coffee maker 50 d including cross-sectional views of the sealed container 10 of FIGS. 1-4B placed inside the coffee maker 50 d without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 8A showing the coffee maker 50 d in an open position and FIG. 8B showing the coffee maker 50 d in a closed position. The coffee maker 50 d may differ from the coffee maker 50 described above in that the coffee maker 50 d may be specifically designed for use with the sealed container 10 , i.e. with no adapter 30 necessary. In this regard, the coffee maker 50 d may be the same as the coffee maker 50 in all respects except for the recess 52 . Whereas the recess 52 includes an exit needle part 54 with an off-center exit needle 55 , the recess 52 d of FIGS. 8A and 8B includes an exit needle part 54 d with an exit needle 55 d that is located in the center. The recess 52 d may further include a funnel part 56 d that is the same as the funnel part 56 except that it is designed to align with the centered exit needle 55 d of the exit needle part 54 d rather than the off-center exit needle 55 of the exit needle part 54 . The recess 52 d may further differ from the recess 52 in that it may have a generally smaller interior than the recess 52 of an existing coffee maker 50 (e.g. a Keurig® coffee maker). This is because, as described above, the sealed container 10 may be significantly smaller than a single-serve ground coffee container like a Keurig® K-Cup® pod. In use, heated water may flow from the water conduit 60 into the sealed container 10 through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the sealed container 10 through the exit needle 55 d and down into the person's coffee cup. Alternatively, the coffee maker 50 d may omit the exit needle 55 d , having only a borehole similar to the borehole 38 a but extending downward from the recess 52 d of the coffee maker 55 d rather than from the recess 32 of the adapter 30 a . Such a modified coffee maker 55 d could be used with the sealed container 10 a having the one or more holes 17 . The combined liquid coffee concentrate 20 and heated water may burst from the sealed container 10 as the interior coating 18 covering the one or more holes 17 melts (or as the sealed container 10 itself bursts open as described above), thereafter flowing down through the borehole 38 a and into the person's coffee cup. In the example of the dedicated coffee maker 50 d of FIGS. 8A and 8B, a funnel part 56 d is included, corresponding to the funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B. The funnel part 56 of FIGS. 4A-7B is a feature some existing coffee makers (e.g. Keurig® coffee makers) and therefore is depicted in FIGS. 4A-7B, which may represent embodiments in the context of existing coffee makers. On the other hand, the coffee maker 50 d shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B represents a coffee maker 50 d that is designed for use with the sealed containers 10 , 10 a , etc. of the present disclosure. Thus, the funnel part 56 d can be omitted. FIGS. 9A and 9B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B, including cross-sectional views of a container 10 e placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 9A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 9B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The container 10 e may be a reusable container rather than a disposable container and may differ from the container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above in several respects. First, the container 10 e may have an open or openable top 78 in place of a sealing cap 14 or film 14 b . As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, for example, the top 78 of the container 10 e may contain a central opening 80 , but it is also contemplated that the top 78 may be openable, e.g. by a hinge. Second, the container 10 e may have a pressure relief valve 82 at the bottom. The pressure relief valve 82 , illustrated schematically in FIGS. 9A and 9B, may be of any known construction that is capable of opening in response to a buildup of pressure in the container 10 e or in the bottom region thereof. In a simple construction, the pressure relief valve 82 may be a flap or door that is biased in a closed position to seal against the container 10 e and opens downward when pushed from above. Third, the overall size and shape of the container 10 e may be somewhat larger than that of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. described above and may, for example, be shaped and sized similarly to a Keurig® K-Cup® pod or other single-serve ground coffee container and designed to fit directly in an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 similar to how the adapter 30 fits in the exit needle part 54 in FIGS. 4A and 4B. For example, an outwardly extending lip 84 of the container 10 e may function just like the lip 36 to allow the container 10 e to rest on the exit needle part 54 of the coffee maker 50 without falling in or touching the needle 55 . Since the container 10 e may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the container 10 e , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the container 10 e through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then place the container 10 e inside the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9A and lower the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 as shown in FIG. 9B. Heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the container 10 e through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the container 10 e through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. In this regard, the valve 82 may be configured to remain closed under the pressure of the liquid coffee concentrate 20 (i.e. after dispensing liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the reusable container 10 D) and to open under the pressure of the flow of water from the water conduit 60 . It should also be noted that the pressure of water and/or steam required to open the pressure relief valve 82 should be less than the threshold pressure of any pressure shutoff switch of the pump 62 . When the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 10 e , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 10 e as the water flows through the reusable container 10 e . Thus, one may immediately reuse the container 10 e. FIGS. 10A and 10B are schematic representations of the coffee maker 50 of FIGS. 4A-7B, 9A, and 9B, including cross-sectional views of another container 10 f placed inside the coffee maker 50 without an adapter 30 , with FIG. 10A showing the coffee maker 50 in an open position and FIG. 10B showing the coffee maker 50 in a closed position. The container 10 f may be the same as the container 10 e and may similarly be reusable, except that the container 10 f may be shaped and sized similarly to an exit needle part 54 (e.g. a Keurig® portion pack holder) of the recess 52 of the coffee maker 50 . Thus, in a case where the coffee maker 50 is a Keurig® coffee maker, an example of the shape and size of the container 10 f is the My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter by Keurig®. Like the container 10 e , since the container 10 f may be reusable and not disposable, there is less concern about trash than in the case of the container 10 , 10 a , etc. and it is not as important to achieve a small size. When a person wishes to use the container 10 f , he/she may pump (e.g. from a pump bottle) or otherwise dispense liquid coffee concentrate 20 into the container 10 f through the top 78 (e.g. via the opening 80 ). The person may then replace the exit needle part 54 and funnel part 56 of the coffee maker 50 with the container 10 f as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B (e.g. in the case of a Kuerig® coffee maker 50 , the Keurig® portion pack holder may be pushed up from below and removed, and the container 10 f may be placed in the resulting recess just like a My K-Cup® reusable coffee filter). With the lid 58 of the coffee maker 50 lowered as shown in FIG. 10B, heated water may then flow from the water conduit 60 into the container 10 f through the entrance needle 66 , and the combined heated water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 may flow out of the container 10 f through the valve 82 and down into the person's coffee cup. As in the case of the container 10 e , when the coffee making process is completed, it may be unnecessary to clean the container 10 f , as the heated water from the coffee maker 50 may sufficiently clean the inside of the container 10 f as the water flows through the reusable container 10 f. In the above examples, water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 (and combined water and liquid coffee concentrate 20 ) are described as flowing through hollow needles 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . However, it is also contemplated that the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may instead only pierce the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. without additionally functioning as a conduit for the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 . For example, the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 may retract subsequent to puncturing the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. or be structured to allow the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 to flow adjacent to or around the outside of the needle 38 , 55 , 55 d , 66 . In the above examples, the top and bottom of the water and/or liquid coffee concentrate 20 enters or exits the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. through the top or bottom of the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. Other points of entry or exit are also contemplated, such as the side. In the above examples, generally cylindrical shapes are depicted for the sealed container 10 , 10 a , etc. However, other shapes are contemplated as well, such as balls, boxes, etc., and it is contemplated that adapters 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to accommodate such shapes. It is similarly envisioned that the exterior of the adapter 30 , 30 a , etc. may be designed to fit inside any single-serve coffee maker, e.g. coffee makers by Keurig®, Nespresso®, Mr. Coffee®, Cuisinart®, Presto® MyJo™, Bunn®, etc., and may be designed to fit universally inside more than one coffee maker.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coffee and coffee houses have surged in popularity. As a result, consumers have become more particular about the coffee that they are willing to drink. Many consumers prefer to buy whole bean coffee roasts, and grind their own coffee because coffee made from fleshly ground beans has a superior aroma and taste. One main appeal of coffee is its aroma. Unfortunately, the aroma quickly escapes from ground coffee beans. Hence, coffee must be made relatively quickly from freshly ground beans to achieve superior aroma and taste. Numerous devices for making coffee include timers that can be set to brew coffee at selected times. The user places water and coffee in the device, sets the timer, and the device brews the coffee at the appropriate time. However, many of these devices do not include a grinder that is controlled by the timer. Hence, coffee beans must be ground in advance, and left in the device until the desired time. Thus, the ground coffee beans usually lose their aroma well before the coffee is brewed. The devices for making coffee also often include a pot for receiving the coffee, which keeps the coffee warm by means of an electric burner. However, a problem with this arrangement is that brewed coffee also loses its aroma over time. Thus, while these devices are capable of keeping a pot of coffee made from freshly ground beans warm for hours on an electric burner, often the coffee has long since lost its desirable aroma and taste. Additional problems are that the pots are not thermally insulated so that unnecessary energy is expended keeping the coffee warm, persons often inadvertently bum themselves on the hot electric burners, and the electric burners are a potential fire hazard. Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved solution to the above problems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a coffee maker for making coffee. The coffee maker includes a housing supporting a coffee grinder for grinding coffee beans; a brewer which includes a reservoir for holding water, a filter basket for receiving ground coffee beans from the grinder and water from the reservoir; a pump in fluid communication with the reservoir; and a heater for heating water from the reservoir. A thermally insulated carafe is removably connected to the housing for receiving coffee from the filter basket of the brewer. In a preferred embodiment, the pump pumps water through the heater, which heats the water, and then into the filter basket. Preferably, the water is pumped through a shower head positioned over the top portion of the filter basket, for showering water down into the filter basket. A central processing unit having a memory is electrically connected to the pump, heater, and grinder for causing operation of the coffee maker at times based on data stored in the memory of the central processing unit. A control panel is electrically connected to the central processing unit for controlling the central processing unit. The control panel includes a plurality of switches, each switch providing an electrical signal received by the central processing unit when a switch is pressed, wherein pressing one of the switches causes the central processing unit to operate the coffee maker in manual mode based on electrical signals received from the switches, rather than at times based on data stored in the memory of the central processing unit. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIG. 1 illustrates a front view of a preferred embodiment of a coffee maker in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 2 illustrates a top view of the coffee maker of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 illustrates a side view of the coffee maker of FIG. 1; FIG. 3A illustrates a cross-sectional view of a self-sealing cap suitable for use with the coffee maker of FIG. 1; FIG. 4 illustrates an enlarged view of the grinder and the filter basket of FIG. 1; FIG. 4A illustrates a cross-sectional view of a portion of another grinder that is suitable for use with the coffee maker of FIG. 1; FIGS. 5-6D illustrate brackets for removably mounting the coffee maker of FIG. 1; FIG. 7 illustrates a schematic, electrical block diagram for the coffee maker of FIG. 1; and FIG. 8 illustrates a schematic diagram showing overall logic for use with the coffee maker of FIG. 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Shown in FIG. 1 is a preferred embodiment of a coffee maker, indicated generally by reference numeral 20, in accordance with the present invention for making coffee. The coffee maker 20 includes a housing 21 supporting a grinder 23 for grinding coffee beans, and several components forming a brewer. Some of the major components of the brewer are a reservoir 24 for holding water, a filter basket 28 for filtering water through ground coffee beans, and a thermal carafe 30. As indicated schematically in FIG. 7, the coffee maker 20 includes a conventional central processing unit (CPU)32 typically used to control consumer goods, such as microwave ovens, ranges, video cassette recorders (VCRs), televisions, etc., that incorporate electronic functions. The CPU 32 is electrically connected to a control and display panel 33, and receives electrical signals 36 therefrom. Preferably, the CPU 32 is located behind the control and display panel 33. As shown in FIG. 1, the control and display panel 33 includes a plurality of conventional switches or buttons 34 that are configured to remain in the open position until pressed, whereupon the buttons close until the pressing force is removed. Pressing a button 34 causes electrical signals 36 to be received by the CPU 32 that controls the operation of the coffee maker. The buttons 34 on the control and display panel 33 are pressed to control the operation of the CPU 32, which in turn controls the operation of the coffee maker 20. The control and display panel 33 includes a clock 40, which may have a traditional face and hands as shown, or a digital display (not shown) for indicating the time of day. The clock 40 includes an AM/PM indicator 42 to indicate whether it is morning (AM) or afternoon (PM), and an alarm display 44. The alarm display 44 indicates at what time CPU 32 will cause the coffee maker 20 to begin making coffee. The control and display panel 33 may include other displays as well, such as a display for indicating the temperature the water in reservoir 24 is to be heated, or particular days or dates the coffee maker 20 is to make coffee. Referring to FIG. 7, the CPU 32 sends electrical signals 46 to the control and display panel 33 so that the appropriate information is displayed by the clock 40, AM/PM indicator 42, and alarm display 44. In particular, the CPU 32 includes an internal timer (not shown) to keep track of the time elapsed from a time that has been entered through the control and display panel 33. Based on the entered time and the time elapsed, the CPU 32 sends electrical signals 46 to control and display panel 33 for displaying the current time on clock 40, and whether it is afternoon or morning on the AM/PM indicator 42. Further, the electrical signals 46 also cause the alarm display 44 to display the time the coffee maker 20 is to begin making coffee. Other information may be displayed as well, such as error indications if an incorrect value has been entered through the control and display panel 33, the temperature that the water from reservoir 24 is to be heated, or other information. The CPU 32 respectively stores and accesses data in memory 48 through electrical signals 50 and 52. Data, such as the time to begin making coffee, the temperature to heat water to, and other information, is stored in memory 48 via electrical signals 50. When required, the CPU 32 retrieves the data via electrical signals 52. The CPU 32 is electrically connected to the grinder 23. At the appropriate time, the CPU 32 causes the grinder 23 to operate to grind beans that have previously been placed in the grinder. In a preferred embodiment, the grinder 23 is operated for a length of time that has been predetermined as sufficient to grind the amount of beans necessary for making the maximum amount of coffee that the coffee maker 20 can make at one time. Specifically, if the water reservoir is able to only hold water sufficient to make twelve cups of coffee, for example, then the grinder 23 is operated for an amount of time necessary to grind beans to make twelve cups of coffee. In an alternate embodiment, the user may enter the actual amount of coffee to be made through control and display panel 33, which would then vary the amount of time the grinder 23 is to be operated. In another embodiment, the coffee maker 20 may include a water level sensor in the reservoir 24, connected to the CPU 32, which would then vary the amount of time to operate the grinder 23, depending on how much water is in the reservoir. Another option in accordance with the invention, is to include a bean level sensor connected to the CPU 32, to directly sense the amount of beans in the grinder 23 and operate the grinder for the amount of time necessary to adequately grind that amount of beans. Referring to FIG. 1, the grinder 23 is of a conventional type, having a blade 54 (shown in phantom) that is spun rapidly by an electric motor (not shown) to grind coffee beans. In a preferred embodiment, the floor 55 of the grinding chamber, and the blade 54 are oriented generally parallel to one another, at an angle relative to horizontal. An angled grinding chamber floor 55 makes it easier to access the floor for cleaning, and as will be explained in more detail later, tends to concentrate the ground beans on one side of the grinding chamber for transfer to the filter basket 28. In alternate embodiments, the blade 54 and the floor 55 of the grinding chamber may be oriented generally horizontal. The grinder 23 includes a cap 56 which is removed from the grinder to place the coffee beans therein. The cap 56 includes a ruled scale 58 formed vertically on the cap for correlating a depth of coffee beans with approximate units of coffee. More particularly, when the cap 56 is removed from the grinder 23, the cap is inverted and coffee beans are placed therein to a depth corresponding to the desired amount of coffee. The beans are then poured from the cap 56 into the portion of the grinder 23 having the blade 54 for subsequent grinding. FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of the grinder 23 and the filter basket 28 removed from the coffee maker 20. Formed on the side of the grinder 23 adjacent the filter basket 28 is an opening covered by a screen 60. When the beans are ground, centrifugal force causes the beans to be thrown against the interior walls of the grinder 23 as the beans are ground. If the beans have been ground to a small enough size, the ground beans escape through the screen 60 into the filter basket 28. In addition, the floor of the grinding chamber 55 is tilted towards the screen 60, such that the ground beans tend to concentrate at the screen. A generally wedge-shaped shield 62 projects downward at an acute angle from the upper edge of the screen 60, and along the vertical edges of the screen. The shield 62 directs ground beans downward into the filter basket 28. Preferably, shield 62 is made of a heat and moisture resistant material that can safely contact food, such as plastic or stainless steel. The filter basket 28 includes a notched region 64 adjacent the grinder 23, so that the filter basket 28 fits snugly underneath the shield 62 against the grinder for receiving ground beans therefrom. In a preferred embodiment, the filter basket 28 is formed of a metal suitable for contact with coffee, such as metal plated with gold, or stainless steel, and is reusable. The filter basket 28 is easily removable from the coffee maker 20 for cleaning. Alternatively, paper filters may be placed in filter basket 28. Preferably, the mesh size of screen 60 is sized to correspond to the type of filter basket 28 that is used. More particularly, water tends to flow more quickly through filter baskets having a conically-shaped bottom, compared to filter baskets having a flat bottom. Thus, filter baskets having a conically-shaped bottom require coffee beans that are ground finer to increase the amount of flavor that the water acquires from the ground beans. In contrast, water flows relatively slowly through flat-bottomed filter baskets. Hence, flat-bottomed filter baskets require beans ground to a coarser size because the water spends more time in contact with the ground beans. Therefore, the mesh size of screen 60 is sized to pass beans of the correct ground size for the type of filter basket 28 that is used. (Filter baskets having conically-shaped bottoms, flat bottoms, or other geometries may be used in accordance with the present invention.) In an alternate embodiment, the screen 60 (see FIG. 4) of the grinder 23 is replaceable with other screens having different mesh sizes. In this way, the grinder can be caused to make coffee grounds of either coarser or finer size, depending upon the mesh size of the screen that is used. Additionally, in this alternate embodiment, the user is given an option to use different types of filter baskets 28, such as filter baskets having conically-shaped bottoms, flat-bottoms or other types of filter baskets. Thus, the user can adjust the coffee ground size to correspond to the type of filter basket 28 that is used, i.e. finer grounds for filter baskets having conically-shaped bottoms, and coarser grounds for filter baskets having flatter bottoms or geometries that slow the flow of water therethrough. Preferably, in this alternate embodiment, the type of filter basket 28, such as conically-shaped or flat-bottomed, is entered through a button or buttons 34 on the control and display panel 33. Thus, the CPU 32 can adjust the amount of time that the grinder 23 is operated, depending on the type of filter basket 28, and screen 60 that is used. In an alternate embodiment, a burr-type grinder 63 may be used as shown in FIG. 4A, in place of a blade-type grinder 23. As shown, the burr-type grinder 63 includes a grinding wheel 45 rotated by a motor (not shown). The wheel 45 is disposed concentrically within a cylindrical chamber 47, having a diameter slightly greater than the diameter of the wheel. Beans 49 are placed in a hopper 51 above the wheel 45, wherein the bottom of the hopper opens into the chamber 47. As the wheel 45 rotates, beans 49 are drawn from the hopper 51, and ground between the wheel and the chamber 47. A chute 53 connects to the bottom of the chamber 47, and leads downward to the filter basket 28. After the beans are ground, the ground beans fall through the chute 47 under the influence of gravity into the filter basket 28. The coffee maker 20 includes a conventional pump 66 indicated in phantom in the side view of the coffee maker in FIG. 3. The pump 66 is located underneath the reservoir 24 and is thus self-priming. The reservoir 24 includes a valve 68 at the lower end of the reservoir 24, which is connected in fluid communication with the interior of the reservoir. The valve 68 slidably connects in fluid communication with a conduit 71, which connects in fluid communication with the pump 66. Water from the reservoir flows through the valve 68 through conduit 71 to the pump 66. Valve 68 includes a handle 70 for opening and closing the valve. Preferably, the reservoir is removable from the coffee maker 20 for filling with water or cleaning. In a preferred embodiment, the reservoir includes a handle 73 as shown in FIG. 1, to facilitate removal/replacement of the reservoir 24. Preferably, the handle 73 is formed integrally with the outer surface of the reservoir, but may be a separately attached component. Alternatively, the handle 73 may simply be a notch formed in the outer surface of the resevoir to provide a finger grip. When the reservoir 24 has been removed from the coffee maker 20, and is being filled with water, valve 68 is closed to prevent the escape of water. After the reservoir 24 has been returned to the coffee maker 20, valve 68 is opened to permit water to flow from the reservoir to the pump 66. The reservoir 24 includes a ruled scale 69 correlating the depth of water in the reservoir with an approximate number of units of coffee, e.g., cups of coffee, that amount of water will produce so that one can determine when the reservoir is sufficiently filled. The reservoir 24 is filled with water through a port formed in the top of the reservoir, which is closed by a cap 72, as indicated in the top view of the coffee maker 20 in FIG. 2. In a preferred embodiment, the pump 66 pumps water from the reservoir 24 through a conventional electric heater 74, indicated in phantom in FIG. 3, located underneath the reservoir 24. The heater 74 heats the water as it is pumped to a temperature suitable for making coffee. Preferably, the heater 74 heats the water to a temperature just below boiling (212° F., boiling water damages the coffee grounds and corrupts the taste of the coffee). Thereafter, the heated water exits the heater through a vertical conduit 76, indicated in phantom. The conduit 76 directs the heated water upwardly along the opposite side of the reservoir 24, relative to the orientation of the coffee maker 20 shown in FIG. 3. The conduit 76 extends to the top of the coffee maker 20, and over the top of the filter basket 28, where the conduit preferably terminates at a shower disk 78, as shown in FIG. 2. The conduit 76 suspends the shower disk 78 centrally over the top portion of the filter basket 28. The shower disk 78 includes a plurality of openings formed on its lower side adjacent the filter basket 28 for showering water received from conduit 76 over ground coffee beans located in the filter basket 28. The shield 62 (see FIG. 4) substantially prevents water from being showered into the grinder 23, as well as directing ground coffee beans into the filter basket 28. The CPU 32 controls the pump 66 and the heater 74 via electrical signals 80 and 82, respectively, as shown in FIG. 7. In the preferred embodiment, the coffee maker 20 includes a water sensor 84 that provides an electrical signal 86 to the CPU indicating the presence of water. The water sensor 84 is preferably a pair of spaced-apart electrical contacts (not shown) located in the conduit 71 (see FIG. 3) connecting the valve 68 to the pump 66. When water is present in the conduit 71, an electrical connection is made between the electrical contacts indicating the presence of water. In a preferred embodiment, the CPU 32 commands the pump 66 to operate only so long as water is available to the pump. Additionally, CPU 32 preferably causes the pump 66 to operate after the grinder 23 has ceased operation, thus ensuring that all of the beans are ground and in the filter basket 28 before water is showered into the filter basket. The coffee maker 20 includes a temperature sensor 90, which provides an electrical signal 92 to the CPU 32 indicating the temperature to which the heater 74 heats the water. The temperature sensor 90 is located in the shower disk 78 so that the temperature of the water being showered on the ground coffee beans in the filter basket 28 is sensed. Preferably, the temperature of the water being showered on the ground coffee beans is at least approximately 200° , but less then boiling (212° F.). Thus, by the time the hot water has traveled through the ground coffee beans and the filter basket 28 into the thermal carafe 30, the water has reached an ideal temperature of between 195° F. to 205° F., which produces more desirable coffee. Temperatures above this range tend to damage the taste of the coffee. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the control and display panel 33, includes a button or buttons 34 for adjusting the coffee temperature according to individual preference. The temperature sensor 90 is preferably of a conventional type, such as a thermistor, which changes resistance in proportion to the temperature of the thermistor. The thermal carafe 30 is of substantially conventional design having a handle 94, and is removably inserted into the coffee maker 20 underneath the filter basket 28 as shown in FIG. 1. The thermal carafe 30 includes an automatic seal valve 93, preferably threadably capping the top of the carafe as shown cross-sectionally in FIG. 3A. Specifically, the valve 93 includes a lid portion 93a having external threads 93b that thread into internal threads formed into the top of the thermal carafe 30. A passage 93c is formed centrally through the lid portion 93a. The automatic seal valve 93 includes a funnel-shaped member 96 extending centrally above the lid portion 93a from the passage 93c formed therethrough. An opening 96a is formed centrally through the funnel shaped member 96 as in a conventional funnel for the passage of fluids. The funnel shaped member 96 includes a column 96b extending concentrically through the opening 96a in the funnel-shaped member, wherein the ends of the column vertically extend to locations above and below the funnel shaped member. The diameter of the column 96a is less than the opening formed through the funnel shaped member 96a, such that fluid may flow around the column, through the opening 96a in the funnel shaped member. A plurality of vanes 96c connect between the funnel shaped member 96 and the column 96b, and support the column concentrically in the opening 96a in the funnel shaped member. The lower end of the column 96a extends concentrically into the passage 93c formed through lid portion 93a. An inverted, cup-shaped gasket 97 connects centrally to the lower end of column 96b, such that the gasket is located on the lower side of the lid portion 93a. A spring 97a is mounted concentrically around the lower portion of the column 96b, between the funnel-shaped member 96, and the gasket 97. The lower side of the spring 97a is supported by a plurality of prongs 97b that extend inwardly from around the periphery of the passage 93c. Thus, the spring 97a presses against the prongs 97b to push the funnel-shaped member 96 upward. However, the gasket 97 has a diameter larger than the diameter of the passage 93c in the lid portion 93a. Thus, the spring 97a can only push the funnel shaped member 96 upward, until the gasket 97 lodges in the mouth of the passage 93c, thereby sealing the valve 93. When the thermal carafe 30 is inserted into the coffee maker 20, the lower portion of the filter basket 28 presses against the vanes 96c of the valve 93. This compresses the spring 97a, such that the gasket 97 moves downwardly to the phantom position shown in FIG. 3 A, spaced below the passage 93c in lid portion 93a. This opens the valve 93 such that coffee can flow from the filter basket 28, through valve 93, into the thermal carafe 30. When the thermal carafe 30 is removed from the coffee maker 20, the pressing force is removed from the vanes 96c, causing the valve 93 to seal, which prevents the escape of heat from the interior of the carafe. Preferably, valve 93 is composed primarily of plastic or other appropriate material that is not a good conductor of heat. Thermal insulation is therefore provided for the coffee, eliminating the need for an electric burner plate to keep the coffee warm. The coffee retains its aroma and taste for a longer period of time in the thermal carafe 30, relative to an electrically heated pot, and permits coffee to be moved about without losing a substantial amount of heat. Additionally, the absence of a warming plate saves energy, eliminates a potential fire hazard, and eliminates a hot surface that persons often burn themselves on. When it is desired to pour coffee from the thermal carafe 30, the lid portion 93a may be threadably removed from the thermal carafe. Alternatively, the thermal carafe 30 includes an exterior spout (not shown) for pouring coffee. The spout connects to a passage or chamber 97c connected in fluid communication to the neck of the carafe. The automatic seal valve 93 may be threaded downwardly to close the passage 97c as shown in FIG. 3A. When it is desired to pour coffee, the automatic seal valve is threadably partially upward in the neck of the thermal carafe 30 to uncover and open the passage 97c. The carafe is then tipped until coffee flows through the passage 97c and out of the spout (not shown). In this way, coffee can be conveniently poured from the thermal carafe 30, while retaining the autmatic seal valve 30 partially threaded to the carafe. In an alternative embodiment, automatic seal valve 93, or a similar type automatic seal valve could be used in place of valve 68 at the bottom of the reservoir 24. Thus, when the reservoir 24 is removed from the coffee maker 20, the valve would automatically seal to prevent water from passing therethrough. However, when the reservoir 24 is inserted into the coffee maker 20, the valve would automatically open. In a preferred embodiment, the coffee maker 20 can also be used in a manual mode by pressing an appropriate button or buttons 34 on the control and display panel 33. In the manual mode, the CPU 32 is commanded to immediately cause the coffee maker 20 to begin making coffee, rather than waiting for the time specified in the alarm display 44. Preferably, in the manual mode, one of the buttons 34 can be pressed that immediately commences operation of the grinder 23 so long as that button is subjected to a pressing force. Thus, direct control is provided over the length of time that the grinder operates in manual mode. In addition, preferably the control and display panel 33 includes a button or buttons 34 for a brew-only function. Thus, if it is desired to use pre-ground coffee, the pre-ground coffee can be placed directly in the filter basket 28. Then the brew-only function can be performed, which commands the coffee maker 20 to by-pass operation of the grinder 23, and proceed directly to brewing coffee. A micro-switch (not shown) preferably detects when the cap 56 to the grinder 23 is in place. If the cap 56 is not in place, the grinder 23 is prohibited from operating by the CPU 32 for safety, cleaning, and to prevent ground coffee beans from being scattered about. Alternatively, rather than providing for manual operation of the grinder 23 through pressing a button 34 on the control and display panel 33, the grinder can be manually operated by pressing downward on the cap 56 as in many conventional grinders. Pressing downward on the cap 56 activates a switch (not shown) that causes the grinder to operate. In this way, the grinder is prevented from being operated manually without the cap 56 being in place. The coffee maker 20 is mountable to a surface, such as a wall, or under a counter. In one preferred embodiment, this is achieved by providing a bracket 98, which may be in the shape of a rectangular plate, as shown in FIG. 5, that is mountable to a surface, such as a wall. Preferably, fastening devices, such as screws, nails, or bolts 100, are used to penetrate through the bracket 98 to mount the bracket to a surface. The side of the bracket 98 opposite the mounting surface supports four arms 102 that are substantially arranged in a cross formation, wherein the intersection of the arms is preferably located generally along the central axis of the bracket 98. The arms 102 are arranged in pairs, wherein each arm of a pair generally opposes the other arm of that pair. One pair of arms 102 preferably extends more or less vertically, while the other pair extends approximately perpendicular to the vertical pair of arms. In a preferred embodiment, the arms 102 are received in channels formed in the side of bracket 98 that faces away from the mounting surface. The arms may be retained in place on bracket 98 by any conventional means, such as glues, adhesives, screws, bolts, or welding. In FIG. 5, the arms 102 are illustrated as fastened to bracket 98 by fasteners 100 that penetrate through each of the arms 102 and through the bracket 98 into the mounting surface. Preferably, the arms 102 are formed of metal or plastic, or other material with sufficient structural integrity, and are integral with one another. More particularly, each of the arms 102 are not separate pieces, but seamlessly connect to one another in a cross arrangement. The distal end of each arm 102 bends approximately perpendicular away from the bracket 98 to form a finger 104 extending away from the mounting surface. Each of the fingers 104 connect to the housing 21 at generally opposing locations 108. Fasteners 110 penetrate through each of the fingers 104 into the housing 21 and thread therein. The fasteners 110 may be of any type known in the art, such as screws, bolts, rivets, pins, and etc. However, preferably the fasteners 110 are knob-screws so that the coffee maker 20 is removable from the fingers 104 by turning the knob-screws 110 to uncouple the knob-screws from the housing 21. In another preferred embodiment, the coffee maker 20 is removably mounted to a surface by including a mounting plate 112 that projects from the rear of the housing 21 forming the coffee maker 20, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 6. The mounting plate 112 is generally rectangular in shape and includes a lip 114 extending from opposite vertical edges of the mounting plate, spaced apart from the rear of the housing 21 as indicated in FIG. 6. The mounting plate 112 is slidably receivable in a mounting bracket 116 that is attached to a mounting surface. The mounting bracket 116 is generally rectangular in shape, having opposite vertical edges that form a pair of opposing channels 118 on the side of the bracket opposite the mounting surface. The lips 114 of the mounting plate 112 on the rear of the coffee maker 20 are each slidably received in a channel 118 of the mounting bracket 116. The bottom of each channel 118 includes a stop (not shown) that prevents the mounting plate 112 from being slid all the way through the channels 118 on the mounting bracket 116. The mounting bracket 116 may be mounted to a surface by any conventional method known in the art. For example, screws, bolts, or adhesives may be used. Preferably, fasteners are used that penetrate through holes 120 formed in the mounting bracket 116, wherein the fasteners penetrate into the surface behind the bracket. Mounting plate 112 also mounts to the rear of the coffee maker 20 by any conventional method known in the art, such as screws, bolts, adhesives, or welding. Further, the mounting plate 112 may be formed integrally with the housing 21 forming the exterior of the coffee maker 20. In operation, the coffee maker 20 is removably slid into and out of engagement with the mounting bracket 116 if it is desired to temporarily relocate the coffee maker to another location. In yet another preferred embodiment, a two-armed bracket 150 is provided for mounting the coffee maker 20 as shown in FIG. 6A. The bracket 150 includes a pair of spaced apart parallel arms 152. The arms 152 are each cantilevered edge-wise at approximate right angles from a rear, rectangular support plate 154. Preferably, the arms 152 are formed integrally with the rear support plate 154, wherein the bracket 150 is formed of metal or plastic, or other material that has some flexibility, yet sufficient structural integrity to safely support the coffee maker 20. The coffee maker 20 is received between the arms 152. The arms 152 may receive the rear, top, or sides of the coffee maker 20 as respectively shown in FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C. The arms 152 could even receive the bottom of the coffee maker 20, if it were desirable to mount the coffee maker to the upper side of a horizontal surface. This might be desirable if the horizontal surface was located in a moving vehicle, such as a boat, motor home, airplane, or other vehicle. Fasteners 110 penetrate through each of the arms 152 into the housing 21 and thread therein. The fasteners 110 may be of any type known in the art, but preferably are knob-screws. Thus, the coffee maker 20 is removable from the arms 152 by turning the knob-screws 110 to uncouple the knob-screws from the housing 21. In a preferred embodiment, a rectangular projection 156 is formed on the inside of each arm 152 at the location where the arm is fastened to the housing 21 with a fastener 110. Each rectangular projection 156 is slidably received in a rectangular recess 158 formed in the housing 21 of the coffee maker 20. The rectangular projections 156 and recesses 158 help ensure the coffee maker 20 will not pivot in bracket 150, if only a single fastener 110 is used to fasten each arm 152 to the coffee maker. Alternatively, the rectangular projections could be eliminated, and two or more fasteners 110 could be used to fasten each arm 152 to the coffee maker. The rear support plate 154 of the bracket 150 includes two spaced apart holes 160 formed therethrough. The holes 160 are for mounting the bracket to a wall, counter, cabinet, or other surface. Specifically, screws, bolts, nails, or other fastening devices are inserted through holes 160, and into the mounting surface. In an alternate embodiment, a plurality of holes 162 could be formed through the arms 152 as shown in FIG. 6C, and in the housing 21 of the coffee maker 20. The plurality of holes 162 are for selectively fastening the coffee maker 20 at different locations between the arms 152. In still another preferred embodiment, a bracket 164 is provided as shown in FIG. 6D. Bracket 164 is substantially identical to bracket 150 described previously, except that bracket 164 includes a first half 166 slidably connected to a second half 168. More particularly, half 166 includes a dovetail 170 projecting from along the rear of the bracket half. The other bracket half 168 includes a corresponding dovetail slot 172 formed along the front of the bracket. The dovetail 170 from the first bracket half is slidably received in the dovetail slot 172. Thus, the bracket 164 is slidably adjustable to receive different sized coffee makers, or other appliances. Dovetail 170, and dovetail slot 172 may have other geometries that permit the first bracket half 166 to be slidably received by the second bracket half 168, such as a T-shaped projection received in a T-shaped slot, or a rectangular projection received in a rectangular slot by way of illustrative non-limiting example. Overall logic suitable for use with the coffee maker 20 is schematically illustrated in FIG. 8. The logic in FIG. 8 commences with a start block 122 followed by a decision block 124. Decision block 124 inquires as to whether a manual grind button has been depressed on the control and display panel 33. If so, the logic proceeds to block 126, which operates the grinder 23. Thereafter, a decision block 128 inquires once again whether a manual grind button is depressed. If so, the logic returns to block 126 and continues to operate the grinder so long as a manual grind button is depressed. Once a manual grind button is no longer depressed, the grinder 23 is stopped in block 130. In the situation where a manual grind button is not initially depressed, the logic inquires as to whether an alarm has been set in decision block 132. If not the logic inquires in decision block 133 whether a brew only button has been pressed. If not the logic returns to the beginning. Otherwise the logic proceed to decision block 136 to inquire whether water is available. If the answer to whether an alarm has been set in decision block 132 is affirmative, the logic proceeds to decision block 134 to inquire whether it is time to make coffee. If so, the logic proceeds to decision block 136 to inquire whether water is available. Otherwise, the logic returns to the beginning. If it is time to make coffee, the grinder 23 has been stopped, or a brew only button has been depressed, decision block 136 inquires whether water is available. If water is unavailable, the logic returns to its beginning. Otherwise the pump 66 is operated in block 138, followed by operation of the heater 74 in block 140. Following operation of the heater 74, decision block 142 inquires whether the water has been heated to the correct temperature. If the water is not at the correct temperature, the heater 74 is adjusted accordingly in block 144. Otherwise, the heat adjust block 144 is bypassed, and decision block 146 inquires whether water is available. If water is available, the logic loops back to block 138 and continues to operate the pump. Otherwise, the pump is stopped in block 148, and the logic repeats. In this way, the logic continually repeats, either waiting for the manual grind button to be depressed, or inquiring whether an alarm is set, and if so, whether it is time to make coffee. When either of these conditions are met, the pump is operated until no more water is available. When water is no longer available, the logic presumes that the coffee making cycle is over, and repeats the cycle again. While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.","5463932"

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Alcoholic liqueurs are popular beverages for consumption alone or in combination with other ingredients in mixed beverages or cocktails, and generally contain one or more flavors that improve the palatability of beverages containing a relatively high content of alcohol by volume. Liqueurs manufactured using coffee or flavored with coffee are popular in mixed beverages, and are widely consumed. Alcoholic liqueurs and mixed beverages are generally consumed in the afternoon, evening, or night. For example, a cocktail using vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream is a popular after-dinner drink. Due to the ingredients and production processes used, these coffee liqueurs contain varying amounts of caffeine. Caffeine is tolerated differently for each individual. For most individuals, ingestion of caffeine promotes mild alertness and decreases tiredness. For others, it is poorly tolerated and may cause nausea or other unwanted effects. Even small amounts of caffeine consumed late in the day may prevent sleep onset or the ability for an individual to obtain restful sleep. Additionally, the manufacture of alcoholic liqueurs from commercially-available spirits presents a tradeoff between alcohol by volume and desired viscosity, and the methods employed to create alcoholic liqueurs may require specialized equipment and increase the overall cost of the commercial product. Finally, conventional bottling methods may also contribute to the oxygen degradation of the flavorants added to liqueurs, causing their flavor profile to change over time. The present invention is directed toward overcoming one or more of the problems discussed above. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a flow chart of coffee liqueur production and distribution in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing the basic process involved with brewing, storing and bottling coffee liqueur embodiments in accordance with the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments herein provide coffee liqueur compositions (coffee liqueur herein) and methods of preparing the same. A high quality coffee liqueur is provided having limited to trace amounts of caffeine, high-proof grain alcohol, vanilla extract and sugar. The coffee taste is attributed to the use of instant decaffeinated coffee or low caffeine coffee beans, the high-proof grain alcohol is typically at least 95.8% alcohol by volume, the vanilla extract is typically from a Mexican bourbon vanilla cultivar and the sugar is typically sucrose. Viscosity and taste of the coffee liqueur are modified by production methods, aging and use of particular non-conventional ingredients for coffee liqueurs. Coffee liqueur production methods are also provided herein for maximizing taste and minimizing product taste degradation, including timing of product release from production and anti-oxidative steps after the coffee liqueur has been prepared. These and other aspects of the invention are described in more detail below. DESCRIPTION Commercially available coffee liqueurs are manufactured using a variety of base alcohols and coffees, and contain caffeine. For example, a popular and widely-available coffee liqueur contains approximately 4.85 mg of caffeine per 1.5 fl oz. serving. Typical drinks may include multiple servings, and typical cocktail drinkers may have many servings in a continuous time period. Liqueurs may also be used on or in desserts. Liqueurs are typically ingested in the afternoon, evening, or at night, resulting in significant caffeine consumption at these times. There is a broad range in individual sensitivity to caffeine. Studies have shown that there is an identifiable genetic component to self-identified “caffeine-sensitive” individuals, who report that they voluntarily reduce their caffeine consumption to prevent sleep impairment (Rétey et al., A genetic variation in the adenosine A2A Receptor gene (ADORA2A) contributes to individual sensitivity to caffeine effects on sleep. Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics 2007;81:692-8). For example, research comparing individuals with caffeine-induced wakefulness to those not as affected by caffeine indicates that the former have considerably longer plasma caffeine half-lives, resulting in a higher likelihood of insomnia even eight hours after drinking coffee (Levy et al., Caffeine metabolism and coffee-attributed sleep disturbances. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics 1983;33:770-5). Additionally, individuals with anxiety disorders have also been found to be caffeine-sensitive, with the consumption of one cup of coffee often triggering panic and anxiety (Boulenger et al., Increased sensitivity to caffeine in patients with panic disorders: preliminary evidence. Archives of General Psychiatry 1984;41(11):1067-71). Alcohol, in amounts commonly consumed, is a strong inhibitor of caffeine metabolism (George et al., Influence of alcohol and caffeine consumption on caffeine elimination. Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology 1986;13(10):731-6). Alcohol ingested with coffee is therefore likely to decrease caffeine metabolism, resulting in a prolonged, elevated caffeine blood plasma concentration. The synergistic effects of alcohol and caffeine in promoting wakefulness negatively impact sleep amount and quality, especially in sensitive individuals that already have either a longer caffeine elimination time or a stronger physiological reaction to low amounts of caffeine. The synergistic effects of the caffeine and alcohol provided by coffee liqueurs results in an increased likelihood of unwanted wakefulness or the onset of other symptoms associated with caffeine sensitivity, and may prevent caffeine-sensitive individuals from enjoying coffee liqueurs. A number of caffeinated alcoholic drinks have received negative publicity after news agencies reported several incidents of serious injury, drunken driving, assault, and other dangerous behavior that occurred after drinking caffeinated alcoholic beverages (Harris, F. D. A. says it may ban alcoholic drinks with caffeine. New York Times, New York Edition Nov. 13, 2009, page A11). In 2010, the combined consumption of caffeine and alcohol was declared a “public health concern” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which stated that the addition of caffeine to certain alcoholic beverages could not be generally recognized as safe (CNN Wire Staff, FDA calls 7 caffeine-alcohol drinks unsafe, CNN Nov. 17, 2010). Some states and cities have gone as far as to ban caffeinated energy drinks as a class. The negative health consequences of combining caffeine and alcohol are known to the general public, however coffee liqueurs continue to contain varying amounts of caffeine. Additional related considerations in the formulation of a coffee liqueur are the base liquor and beverage viscosity. Liqueurs are generally made from the combination of a commercially-available, neutrally-flavored distilled spirit with sweeteners and flavors or flavor extracts, the relative amounts of which determine viscosity and alcohol by volume. The ethanol, water, and other compounds in the base liquor tend to reduce the viscosity of any liqueur. The use of typical liquors, such as vodka in the 80-100 proof range, results in the beverage manufacturer having to choose between reducing the alcohol by volume to achieve a thicker viscosity, and adding thickeners that may change the flavor profile of the beverage. The flavor profile of a coffee liqueur is critical to its enjoyment and commercial viability, and the choice of base liquor largely determines the flavor profile, with commercially-available spirits limiting other aspects of the formulation of a desirable beverage. Alcoholic liqueurs are manufactured using a variety of methods. Ingredients may be combined before a cooking or brewing step, and fermented together and distilled into a final product. Alternatively, commercially-available or other liquors may be used in combination with additive ingredients, and mixed with or without a heating step. The method employed determines flavor, viscosity, consistency, and the amount of separation observed in the final beverage, and impacts the final price. Generally, the manufacture of flavored liqueurs requires complex equipment and methods, increasing the commercial price. Commercially-available coffee liqueurs frequently include secondary flavors, such as spices, that modify the taste and smell of the beverage. The secondary flavors may be added before or after, and may be in the form of an extract. The specific origin of the flavorings, timing of their inclusion, and method of manufacturing the beverage determine the extent to which the resulting liqueur incorporates their flavors and aroma, and may also modify the viscosity of the product. One spice that may be included is vanilla, which is preferred for its floral overtones and sweet flavor that compliments and improves the flavor of coffee. The three most commonly available vanilla cultivars are Tahitian, Mexican, and Bourbon/Madagascar vanilla, with each having a distinct flavor profile (Types of vanilla: Tahitian, Mexican and Madagascar. Huffington Post, Apr. 9, 2012, accessed online Mar. 26, 2013). Conventional coffee liqueurs may use extracts of multiple cultivars, or may include imitation vanilla, which may result in suboptimal flavor or even include coumarin, which is moderately hepatotoxic to humans if consumed in high doses (Marles et al., Coumarin in vanilla extracts: Its detection and significance. Economic Botany 1987;41:41-7; abstract only). The inclusion of secondary flavors, including spices, may decrease the shelf life of the liqueur. While alcohol has a substantial shelf life over which it will maintain the same flavor profile, coffee has a much shorter shelf life. Spice extracts, such as vanilla, may have substantial edible shelf lives; however their flavor profile changes over time as oxygen and other compounds react with the extract compounds. A typical bottle for a liqueur includes a screw-top or corked closure, which is permeable to oxygen. As the compounds of the liqueur react with oxygen, additional oxygen is allowed to enter the bottle, allowing a continual degradation of the product. The present invention overcomes these problems by using a decaffeinated instant coffee to reduce the amount of caffeine. Additional improvements are the use of a high-proof alcohol, a simplified process for manufacturing a coffee liqueur, the optional inclusion of a Mexican bourbon vanilla extract, and the optional use of a hand-resealable flip-top bottle. The present invention comprises a liqueur made with decaffeinated coffee. Coffee, as used herein, refers to any harvested and prepared bean, or any combination of harvested and prepared beans, of the genus Coffea, including but not limited to Arabica and Robusta varieties. Decaffeinated, as used herein, refers to coffee with a low caffeine content compared to regular coffee, optimally with less than 50 mg per 8 fl. Oz. prepared cup. In some embodiments, the caffeine content is less than 40 mg per 8 fl. Oz. prepared cup, less than 30 mg per 8 fl. Oz. prepared cup, less than 20 mg per 8 fl. Oz. prepared cup, or less than 10 mg per 8 fl. Oz. prepared cup. In additional embodiments, there are only trace amounts or undetectable amounts of caffeine or caffeine may be entirely absent. The coffee may be decaffeinated using any method, e.g. using water, ethyl-acetate, supercritical carbon dioxide, liquid carbon dioxide, or methylene chloride (Decaffeination. International Coffee Organization [http://www.ico.org/decaffeination.asp], accessed Mar. 26, 2013). The invention may also use a low caffeine coffee bean cultivar, such as Coffea charrieriana, or a genetically modified coffee bean that produces lower caffeine concentrations. The coffee is preferably instant coffee, which may be prepared by any commercial method, such as freeze-drying or spray drying. Additional forms of instant coffee suitable for use in the invention include liquid preparations or other concentrates. Instant coffee is advantageous because it is essentially dried prepared coffee, and upon rehydration does not contain substantial bean fragments or coffee grounds, which impair flavor and texture. Instant coffee has the further advantage of absorbing significant amounts of water within the mixture, while non-instant prepared coffee contains additional water, making it more difficult to achieve the desired beverage viscosity without the addition of adjunct materials or additional steps to evaporate or otherwise reduce water content. Also, because the instant coffee is designed to have desirable and consistent flavor and texture profiles after dehydration and rehydration, the final product can be made with greater consistency as compared to the use of non-instant coffee. Flavor and texture consistency between individual units of a product are critical to establishing brand value and retaining customers, who rely on consistent flavor when enjoying the product alone or in combination with other ingredients in a cocktail or mixed drink. The liqueur comprises a base alcohol, which is one or more distillates of one or more fermented products. The fermented products are of any type normally fermented to produce alcohol for human consumption (ethanol), including but not limited to grain, potato, corn, sugar or sugar cane, or any other source of fermentable sugars/carbohydrates. The products are fermented using any technique to obtain a liquor having a relatively low alcohol by volume, and are then distilled using any technique to increase the alcohol by volume. The base alcohol may be varied depending on the desired flavor, alcohol by volume, and viscosity of the final product. In some embodiments, the alcohol by volume is relatively high, and is preferably higher than that of common commercially available liquors, which generally contain 30-50% alcohol by volume. A typical base alcohol of the invention is a high-proof alcohol, containing an alcohol by volume of around 95.8%. More typically, the base alcohol is a high-proof alcohol derived from grain. High-proof alcohol is preferred because it contains fewer non-ethanol compounds, which modify the final flavor of the product. High-proof grain alcohol is a neutral flavored spirit that imparts no undesirable flavors to the liqueur, and is unlikely to vary in flavor between distillations. Also, because the flavors of most alcohols vary between distillation batches, the use of high-proof alcohol allows the substitution or mixing of high-proof alcohols derived from different base materials with little impact on flavor. Further, the use of high-proof alcohol reduces the amount of water added with the alcohol, reducing the need for additional calculation in the manufacture of the liqueur. The liqueur may further comprise one or more sugars or other sweeteners to improve the taste of the product. The sugar may be selected from any sugar for human consumption, and in one embodiment is sucrose. In other embodiments, the sugar is fructose, dextrose, corn syrup, or a combination of sugars suitable for human consumption. The inclusion of sugar also thickens the liqueur, allowing the manufacturer to achieve a desired viscosity. The liqueur may further comprise water, which may be of any suitable type, including but not limited to water containing additional chemicals or substances, such as spring or tap water, or substantially pure water, such as distilled water. In a preferred embodiment, distilled water is used. The use of distilled water improves batch consistency by eliminating the effects of the variable inclusions found in tap or spring water, and also allows a favored water profile to be created using additional minerals and additives if required. In another embodiment, spring water or treated river water is used, and may be adjusted to a preferred mineral profile by adding compounds or adjusting pH. The amount of water may be varied to adjust the viscosity and other characteristics of the final product. The coffee liqueur of the invention optionally comprises further additives that enhance one or more features of the liqueur, such as taste, texture, aroma, or stability. The additives may include natural or artificial chemicals, including but not limited to plant extracts, spices, and artificial flavorings. An exemplary additive is a vanilla extract. Vanilla extract is preferred for its flavor, as well as its improved consistency over the addition of non-extract vanilla, which has a greater variation in flavor and potency between individual pods and commercial batches. Vanilla extract also has as greater shelf life, and may give an increased shelf life to the final product as compared to using non-extract vanilla. Also, the use of vanilla extract eliminates the need to filter and remove vanilla bean particles, making the production of the liqueur more efficient. In a typical embodiment, the vanilla extract is from a Mexican bourbon vanilla cultivar. Mexican bourbon vanilla is prized for its strong vanilla flavor and subtle underlying sweetness, and provides a substantially stronger flavor than regular Mexican vanilla because it is derived from a Madagascar vanilla cultivar. The liqueur of the invention may be manufactured by any number of methods, and the ingredients can be added in different orders and at different times, depending on the desired product characteristics. A preferred method of the invention is to prepare a mixture of instant decaffeinated coffee, base liquor, water, and optional additives such as sugar and vanilla extract, and mix at a temperature suitable to dissolve the sugar. The mixture is optionally adjusted or diluted with water as desired, is optionally filtered, and is bottled into a commercially-appropriate container. The container is preferably of a hand resealable flip-top design, which allows a consumer to easily reseal the bottle between uses. This may increase the shelf life of the product by limiting the amount of oxygen available to oxidize compounds in the liqueur. The liqueur may optionally be aged before being bottled or after bottling but before being sold commercially to improve the flavor profile, viscosity, consistency, or aroma. In a preferred embodiment, the manufacturing procedure includes the following steps: dissolving the coffee into water, dissolving the sugar into the water/coffee mixture, optionally adding vanilla, adding ethanol, mixing thoroughly, adjusting to the desired volume using water, then bottling the resulting product. The mixture is optionally aged for at least 15 to 30 days before or after bottling, typically at least 20 days before or after bottling, more typically at least 30 days before or after bottling. Referring to the Figures, FIG. 1 illustrates one possible production, storage and bottling embodiment in accordance with the present invention. Initially an amount of water is obtained and heated in a brewing vessel 100 . The amount of water is determined by the ultimate batch size of desired end-product but can be 1 gallon, 5 gallons, 10 gallons, 20 gallons or other increment. Typical embodiments allow the water to reach and maintain a temperature of from 125° F. to 150° F. The water can be obtained from a spring or tap source, can be distilled, deionized, or distilled and deionized. Heated water is stirred/mixed constantly during the production phase, i.e., prior to transfer into storage vessels or distribution bottles. Decaffeinated coffee is added to the heated water 110 . The heated water is stirred until substantially all of the coffee is dissolved. Decaffeinated coffee can be brewed and added to the water as a liquid, in which case 1.5-2.5 ounces of brewed decaffeinated coffee is added per one gallon of pre-heated water. In the absence of pre-brewing the decaffeinated coffee, the ground bean can also be added directly to the heated water. Sugar is also added to the heated water 120 . The sugar can be added prior to, with or after addition of the decaffeinated coffee. The sugar/heated water is stirred until substantially all of the sugar is dissolved. In one embodiment, from 2.5 to 3.0 pounds of sugar is added per gallon of water. After both the coffee and sugar are in solution the brewing vessel is removed from the heat source 130 . The solution is allowed to cool back to room temperature and from 50 to 60 milliliters of vanilla extract is added per gallon of water 140 . Prior to, with or after addition of the vanilla to the cooled solution, 1 to 1.5 pounds 191.6 proof (95.8% ABV) ethanol is added per gallon of solution 150 . Once the vanilla and ethanol are fully incorporated, the solution is removed from mixing/stirring conditions and the solution transferred from the brewing vessel to an interim storage vessel 160 . Interim storage vessels include large sealed vessels, for example stainless steel vessels (one particular embodiment is a 55 gallon stainless steel sealed vessel. The liquid volume of the solution can be verified in these vessels 170 . The solution temperature can also be verified. Based on the liquid volume and amount of ethanol added to the solution a “proof” of liquid is determined 190 . In some embodiments, the coffee liqueur is now ready to be aged for from 15 to 30 or more days in the storage vessel and more typically from 20 to 30 or more days in the storage vessel. In some embodiments the coffee liqueur is aged for at least 30 days. It is also envisioned that coffee liqueurs of the invention can be transferred to bottles for distribution prior to being aged. Regardless, the aged or non-aged coffee liqueur is transferred to bottles for distribution 200 . Where the liqueur was not aged in the storage vessel, the liqueur could be aged in the bottle for an amount of time previously discussed herein. Finally, bottled liqueur is labeled and packaged for distribution and sale 210 . As noted above, typical embodiments herein utilize resealable flip-tip bottles that limit product oxidation. Although not shown in FIG. 1, the coffee liqueur can also be filtered between transfer of the solution from the brewing vessel to the storage vessel or between transfer between the storage vessel and the distribution bottles. Typical filters can be built into a transfer funnel and are appropriate for debris removal. Referring to FIG. 2, a simplified schematic shows addition of vanilla, sugar, coffee, water and ethanol to a brewing vessel 300 . Storage of the solution is storage vessels 400 and transfer of the solution to bottles for distribution and sale of the liqueur. The batch size, or amount produced at any given time, may be any suitable volume, depending on the desired output. The product characteristics generally do not vary considerably with increased batch size, and the relative ingredient amounts may be held constant as batch size increases, or varied by small amounts to achieve the desired product characteristics. In some embodiments, the contributions of certain additives to one or more features of the liqueur may not scale in a linear fashion with the amount added, requiring the relative amount of the additive or additives to be increased or decreased as the remaining ingredients are scaled in a linear fashion. The equipment used in production may change as batch size increases. For example, as batch size increases, larger mixing and storage vessels or larger scale commercial mixing or preparation equipment may be used. In a typical embodiment, a batch size of 10 gallons is used. In additional embodiments, the batch size may be less than 10 gallons, greater than 10 gallons but less than 50 gallons, greater than 50 gallons but less than 500 gallons, or greater than 500 gallons. The final texture and viscosity of the product may vary depending on the intended use or commercial variation of the product. For example, the desired viscosity for use in a beverage may be less than the desired viscosity for use as a dessert topping, for which a thicker consistency is preferred for retention on the surface of the dessert. The viscosity may be adjusted by any available method, such as by changing the relative amounts of any of the ingredients, adjusting the alcohol-by-volume of the base alcohol, or adjusting the concentration of any included extract. In one embodiment, the use of high-proof grain alcohol allows a higher maximum viscosity to be achieved at a desired product alcohol-by-volume. Preferred ingredient amounts for a 10 gallon batch size are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Ingredient Amount Water 40-45 lbs. Vanilla Extract 500-600 mL Instant Decaf Coffee 15-25 oz. Sugar 25-30 lbs.

No. 10/272,968, filed Oct. 17, 2002, which claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/345,234, filed Oct. 19, 2001, both of which are herein incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to liquid coffee concentrates, methods of producing and assessing the quality of liquid coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Consumers produce the traditional “pot of coffee” by extracting the desired components of roast and ground coffee using an automatic drip coffee maker (ADC) or other form of brewer. Although the flavor and aroma of such a coffee beverage is highly desired and appreciated, the inconvenience of the brewing process has lead to the development of instant coffee and coffee concentrate products that allow the consumer to quickly make a single cup of coffee. Unfortunately, the production processes used to produce such coffee products result in finished products having ratios of flavor and aroma components that are different from fresh brewed coffee. As a result, coffee beverages produced from such concentrated products do not have the highly desired flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee. Since the flavor and aroma of fresh brewed coffee is especially desired by consumers, attempts have been made to improve the flavor and aroma of products made from coffee concentrates. Such attempts include incorporating volatile aroma flavor components into the finished concentrates, and the intensification of such components by the application of thermal energy. While such attempts are appreciated, there remains a need for a liquid coffee concentrate having the same ratios of flavor and aroma components as that of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the coffee concentrate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicant's invention relates to a liquid coffee concentrate having a furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value that is from about 50% to about 210% of the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Applicants also claim methods of producing and assessing the quality of coffee concentrates and products containing said concentrates. DETAILED DESCRIPTION A. Definitions As used herein, the term “coffee product” includes, but is not limited to coffee concentrates, coffee extracts and fresh brewed coffee. As used herein, the term “coffee concentrate” means a coffee extract that has undergone additional processing, such as thermal treatment. As used herein, the term “pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's pyridine and 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting pyridine's peak area value is divided by said 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran's peak area value. As used herein, the term “furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value” refers to the number that is obtained when a coffee product's furfuryl acetate and 4-ethyl guaiacol peak area values are determined according to Applicants' analytical test and said resulting furfuryl acetate's peak area value is divided by said 4-ethyl guaiacol's peak area value. As used herein, the term “unit operation” includes, but is not limited to, equipment used to transfer heat such as heaters and coolers; holders; and transfer lines. All percentages and ratios are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, the articles a and an, when used in a claim, are understood to mean at least one of the components that are claimed or described. Publications, patents, and patent applications are referred to throughout this disclosure. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. B. Coffee Concentrate Characteristics and Preparation The quality of any ready-to-use coffee product, made from a coffee concentrate, is dependent on the properties of the concentrate. Although coffee concentrates contain innumerable aroma and flavor components, Applicants discovered that the flavor and aroma of products made from concentrate approaches that of fresh brewed coffee when the concentrate's ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol approaches the furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol ratio value of fresh brewed coffee brewed from the same coffee used to produce the concentrate. In addition to discovering the correlation between the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol, and flavor and aroma, Applicants discovered that a coffee concentrate's ratio of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol can be adjusted by the application of thermal energy to the concentrate. While evaluating the suitability of thermal processing, Applicants discovered that the entire, rather than just the hold tube portion, of a time and temperature profile must be considered. Applicants also recognized that the suitability of any set of thermal processing conditions is not only time and magnitude dependent but rate dependent as well. As a result, more common thermal processing descriptors such as Fo are insufficient to describe the thermal processing conditions that will result in the flavor and aroma improvements of Applicants' invention. Thus, Applicants' processing conditions are described in terms of equivalent times and temperatures, as thermal processing conditions that are time, magnitude and rate dependent can be effectively and efficiently described by these descriptors. A detailed description of Applicants' coffee concentrate and processes of making said concentrate is set forth in detail below. 1. Coffee Concentrate Embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 50% to about 210% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 65% to about 150% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. Still other embodiments of Applicants' coffee concentrate have a ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol that is from about 80% to about 120% of the ratio value of furfuryl acetate to 4-ethyl guaiacol of fresh brewed coffee brewed with the same coffee used to produce said coffee concentrate. 2. Process of Making Coffee Concentrate Coffee extracts that can be thermally processed according to Applicants' process can be prepared by any suitable process used to produce a coffee extract. Preferably, said coffee extracts are non-hydrolysed liquids having pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio values of from about 3:1 to about 25:1 and solids contents of from about 2.3% to about 25% by weight. Other preferred non-hydrolysed liquid coffee extracts include those extracts having a pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value of from about 4:1 to about 20:1 and a solids content of from about 3.5% to about 10% by weight; and those extracts having a pyridine to 5-methyl-2-furfurylfuran ratio value of from about 4.5:1 to about 15:1 and a solids content of from about 3.5% to about 8% by weight. Suitable methods of producing a coffee extract include, but are not limited to, extracting said concentrate from roasted and ground, caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee using a continuous flow column. Said columns are typically stainless steel vertical columns having a height-to-diameter ratio greater than or equal to 6:1 and a perforated top and bottom retainer to permit the transport of feed water while simultaneously keeping coffee granules between the retainers. Suitable columns can be obtained from Niro A/S of Soeborg, Denmark. Suitable extraction conditions include, but are not limited to, operating the extraction process at a temperature less than 149° C. and achieving a flow rate ratio of kilograms water per minute to kilograms of coffee from about 0.1:1 to about 0.5:1, a water front speed of from about 5 cm to about 25 cm per minute, a draw-off ratio of mass of extract to mass of coffee from about 4:1 to about 10:1; and a yield of from about 17% to about 35%. Other suitable extraction conditions include operating the extraction process at a temperature less than 149° C. and achieving a flow rate ratio of kilograms water per minute to kilograms of coffee from about 0.2:1 to about 0.4:1, a water front speed of from about 12.5 cm to about 25 cm per minute, a draw-off ratio of mass of extract to mass of coffee from about 5.5:1 to about 8:1; and a yield of from about 17% to about 30%; and operating the extraction process at a temperature less than 149° C. and achieving a flow rate ratio of kilograms water per minute to kilograms of coffee from about 0.25:1 to about 0.36:1, a water front speed of from about 12.5 cm to about 15.2 cm per minute, a draw-off ratio of mass of extract to mass of coffee from about 6.5:1 to about 7:1; and a yield of from about 23% to about 27.5%. Still other suitable extraction conditions include operating the extraction process at a temperature range of from about 65° C. to about 99° C. or from about 82° C. to about 93° C. and achieving any set of flow rate, water front speed, draw-off ratio and yield parameters detailed previously.

FIELD The present invention relates to a process for the extraction of roast and ground coffee with water, in particular, to a process which involves the processing of a coffee slurry to provide a coffee beverage product having an improved flavour and mouthfeel. The present invention further relates to a coffee product which can be obtained by the process. BACKGROUND The extraction of roast and ground coffee with water to obtain a high coffee-solids coffee extract is well known. Moreover, it is well known to dry such an extract with spray- or freeze-drying to obtain a soluble beverage powder. This beverage powder can then be reconstituted at the consumer's convenience with hot water to obtain a coffee beverage. It is desirable that such a home-made coffee beverage has a taste akin to coffee shop beverages. The industrial production of soluble coffee products is associated with higher temperatures and pressures than coffee shop brewing systems. This allows a higher yield to be obtained from the beans and hence a higher profitability, but has a side-effect that the coffee can adopt undesirable processing flavour notes. A large number of different techniques are employed to avoid this, including methods of aroma capture to ensure that flavour molecules are retained from initial lower temperature extraction steps. An example of a conventional coffee extraction process involves the following steps. Green coffee beans are roasted to a desired roasting extent and ground to a particle size of 2-3 mm. This is subject to a column extraction process having a first step at about 150° C. and a second at a higher temperature of about 185° C. Coffee extracts washed from the beans in each extraction step are combined, concentrated and dried. The process is semi-continuous with the use of multiple extraction columns. EP0826308 discloses a process for the counter-current extraction of soluble coffee solids. Soluble coffee solids are extracted from roast and ground coffee in a first extraction stage using a primary extraction liquid at a temperature of 80° C. to 160° C. Then soluble coffee solids are extracted from the partially extracted grounds in a second extraction stage using a secondary extraction liquid at a temperature of 160° C. to 190° C., the coffee grounds having at least 25% by weight of soluble coffee solids extracted from them. The coffee grounds obtained from the second extraction stage are drained and thermally hydrolysed in a hydrolysis stage at a temperature of 160° C. to 220° C. for 1 to 15 minutes. Soluble coffee solids are extracted from the hydrolysed coffee grounds in a third extraction stage using a tertiary extraction liquid at a temperature of 170° C. to 195° C. to provide extracted coffee grounds and a hydrolysed coffee extract. A soluble coffee product is obtained containing at least 30% saccharides, comprising less than 1% furfural derivatives, less than 4% monosaccharides, less than 10% oligosaccharides and at least 19% polysaccharides, the saccharides having a weighted average molecular weight of greater than 2000 units with a polydispersity above 3. EP0916267 discloses a process for the continuous extraction of water soluble solids from solid particles containing them, such as roast and ground coffee, for providing an extract product in one or more extraction stages. In each extraction stage, a slurry containing particles to be extracted and extract is introduced into an extraction reactor e.g. immediately above a solid-liquid separator to form an upwardly moving packed bed. Particles are scraped from the packed bed for defining an upper surface of the packed bed. An extraction liquid is introduced into the extraction reactor above the upper surface of the packed bed. A portion of the extraction liquid percolating through the packed bed for extracting water soluble substances from the particles in the packed bed is obtained to form an extract. The remaining portion of the extraction liquid entrains the particles scraped from the packed bed for providing a spent particles slurry. The spent particles slurry is removed from the extraction reactor. Extract is removed from below the packed bed and at least a portion of the extract forms the extract product. The extraction stages may be separated by one or more solubilization stages. EP1069830 discloses a process for the recovery of aroma components from coffee. A slurry of coffee grounds in an aqueous liquid is subjected to stripping for stripping aroma components from the slurry. The stripping is carried out using gas in a substantially counter-current manner to provide an aromatised gas containing aroma components. The aroma components are then collected from the aromatised gas. The aroma components may be added to concentrated coffee extract prior to drying of the extract. The coffee powder produced has much increased and improved aroma and flavour and contains higher levels of furans and diketones. U.S. Pat. No. 3,682,649 discloses a cold water, pressurised extraction of roasted coffee, in the form of whole beans or ground, to obtain a quality coffee extract and partially extracted coffee which can be further processed. The coffee extract can be dried to obtain a premium soluble coffee. The partially extracted coffee can be further extracted by standard percolation techniques or can be dried and used as regular roasted and ground coffee. U.S. Pat. No. 3,652,292 discloses the manufacture of an instant coffee powder which comprises soluble coffee solids prepared by extraction as an aqueous medium, into which wet ground colloidal particles of roast or extracted roast coffee are added. The colloidal particles represent about 3 percent to 40 percent by weight of the total weight of the coffee product. The colloidal particles are stabilized against flocculation by regulation of the pH so as not to exceed a pH of 5.2 and said particles are encased in the dried soluble coffee solids to form an instant coffee product having a fresh-brewed coffee aroma flavour and turbidity. EP1795074 relates to a method of providing a concentrated coffee extract which is rich in aroma component released when the roasted coffee beans are ground and has an amount of coffee oil controllable in accordance with the use and purpose, and a process for industrially producing the same. According to the present invention, the above object is achieved by separating an aroma component-containing distillate, a coffee oil-containing liquid, and a coffee extract from a slurry obtained by wet-grinding roasted coffee beans, and after the coffee extract is concentrated, adding back the aroma component-containing distillate and the coffee oil-containing liquid. Since the production of liquid (i.e. aqueous) coffee extracts and dried soluble coffee products is associated with a disparity in flavour, compared to freshly made coffee beverages made fresh in a coffee-shop environment, there is a constant aim to improve the methods of production to achieve improved products. One common approach to improving the flavour of dried soluble coffee products is the addition of finely ground roasted coffee particles into a coffee extract before drying. The inclusion of such particles is typically controlled to avoid undue sediment in the beverage, but generally does have a beneficial effect on the product flavour. The presence of small particles can also contribute to the observed mouthfeel. SUMMARY Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved method for making coffee products, improved coffee products and/or to tackle at least some of the problems associated with the prior art or, at least, to provide a commercially viable alternative thereto. According to a first aspect there is provided a method for the manufacture of a coffee-extract product, the method comprising: (a) providing roast and ground coffee having a mean particle size of from 100 to 600 microns; (b) mixing the roast and ground coffee with water to form a first slurry containing 15 to 30 wt % coffee solids, (c) passing the first slurry through an aroma-separation step to recover a coffee aroma fraction and to form a dearomatised slurry; d) passing the dearomatised slurry to a first filtration device at a temperature of from 90 to 150° C. to form a first coffee extract and a first filter cake; (e) adding water to the first filter cake to form a reconstituted slurry having at least 12 wt % coffee solids; (f) thermally treating the reconstituted slurry at a temperature of from 150 to 205° C.; (g) then passing the thermally-treated reconstituted slurry to a second filtration device to form a second coffee extract and a second filter cake; (h) combining the first and second coffee extracts to form a third coffee extract; (i) concentrating the third coffee extract to form a fourth coffee extract having 35 to 70 wt % coffee solids; (j) adding the coffee aroma fraction to the fourth coffee extract to form a liquid, coffee-extract product. The present invention will now be further described. In the following passages different aspects of the invention are defined in more detail. Each aspect so defined may be combined with any other aspect or aspects unless clearly indicated to the contrary. In particular, any feature indicated as being preferred or advantageous may be combined with any other feature or features indicated as being preferred or advantageous. The present invention provides a method for the manufacture of a coffee-extract product. That is, the invention provides coffee products obtainable from a coffee extract. Examples of such products include liquid concentrates, such as are sold as bag-in-box coffee products, or soluble coffee products, such as freeze-dried or spray-dried powders or tablets. The liquid concentrates and soluble coffee products are both considered to be “instant” coffee products since they immediately form a beverage on the addition of water. All of these different product-types are well known in the art. Such products may be supplemented by the addition of a small amount of finely ground roast and ground coffee to improve the flavour or appearance, as is well known in the art. The present application refers to “solids”. These are the matter which remains after all water has been removed. Accordingly, if you take a coffee beverage and remove the water (by evaporation) you will be left with coffee solids. These coffee solids will comprise soluble coffee solids and insoluble coffee solids. The insoluble coffee solids will include roast and ground coffee material as well as coffee oils. A further distinction is made herein for the insoluble coffee sediment fraction which is the non-oil portion of the insoluble coffee solids. This invention utilizes a new extraction process which can fundamentally change the flavour and taste of instant coffee, while still only relying on water extraction. Key parameters driving these changes are through using a much finer grind size in combination with lower extraction and hydrolysis temperatures, but without compromising the yield of the process. The present invention has a number of advantages over prior art methods as will become apparent from the discussion below. One advantage of the present process is that it can be conducted in a fully continuous manner. This saves cost and complexity in the processing apparatus. Another benefit is that it can be operated with lower amounts of water, which is of course environmentally desirable, but also leads to large energy savings when aiming to provide liquid concentrates or dried powders, since less water needs to be removed. The present invention also uses a lower than conventional temperature in the initial heat treatment which encourages the recovery of more desirable coffee flavours. Since the method has a higher temperature secondary heat treatment, this ensures that the high yield is maintained. Furthermore, the invention provides a coffee product which has an improved flavour and taste. In particular, the flavour and taste are surprisingly different from products obtained by conventional methods, such that the beverage has a thicker mouthfeel and better flavour notes. The method comprises a number of steps. It will be apparent that a number of these steps must be conducted sequentially on a given portion of the material being processed, but it should also be appreciated that the steps can be conducted as part of a continuous process, batchwise or a combination of the two. According to the first step (step (a)), a roast and ground coffee is provided having a mean particle size of from 100 to 600 microns, preferably 200 to 600 microns. The roast and ground coffee is obtained from coffee beans which have been roasted and ground using well established techniques in the art. The mean particle size is the D50, as measured using a Helos dry laser diffractometer under standard measurement conditions. The grind size adopted here is much finer than that employed for conventional coffee extraction processes which typically use particle sizes of about 2 mm. The fine particle size allows the formation of a pumpable slurry, while increasing the surface area for extraction. Conversely, the energy required to grind the coffee to this size is not too great and does not result in undesirable heat-degradation of the beans during grinding. Preferably the roast and ground coffee is ground to a mean particle size of from 200 to 400 microns, more preferably 250 to 350 microns, which is in the region of particle sizes conventionally ground for the production of expresso coffee beverages. This is particularly advantageous since, as explained below, less water needs to be added to make a slurry. Moreover, below 250 microns the filtration becomes harder and less efficient. At particle sizes below 100 microns the particles can block the filter. In another embodiment, preferably the roast and ground coffee has a mean particle size of from 400 to 600 microns. This is particularly advantageous for making liquid coffee concentrates. This is because for liquid product it is better to have larger particles to reduce oil content in the product, since oil contributes to crema instability in liquids. The larger particle size releases less oil into the obtained extract. According to a further step (step (b)), the roast and ground coffee is mixed with water to form a first slurry containing 15 to 30 wt % coffee solids. That is, water is added to the coffee beans in a ratio such that the coffee beans provide 15-30 wt % of the whole mixture, preferably 20 to 25 wt %. The coffee solids include insoluble coffee solids as well as soluble coffee solids, some of which will dissolve into the added water. This level of water provides a pumpable slurry. The amount of water required for a pumpable slurry depends on the size of the grind employed: a coarser grind requires more water for pumpability. With a grind size of about 250 microns, it is readily possible to use a dilution to achieve, for example, 25% solids. With a grind size of about 100 microns, it is readily possible to use a dilution to achieve, for example, 30% solids. However, at a particle size of 400 to 600 microns, it is desirable to add more water, such as to achieve 15% solids. According to a further step (step (c)), the first slurry is passed through an aroma-separation step to recover a coffee aroma fraction and to form a dearomatised slurry. Aroma separation systems are well known in the soluble coffee production field. An exemplary treatment unit is a spinning cone column which can be operated to extract the aroma. This involves the introduction of steam into the slurry which strips aroma from the coffee which can be recovered as an aqueous aroma stream which is stored for later use. Step (c) may be conducted under vacuum. The temperature of the slurry in the aroma-separation step can be adjusted as required, but is typically in the region of 70 to 100° C., such as 90 to 100° C., at the start of the treatment. This heat treatment (i.e. the aroma separation) is preferably conducted for from 10 seconds to 2 hours, 1 minute to 25 minutes, preferably 1 to 5 minutes. In an alternative embodiment the duration may be 15 to 25 minutes. The temperature may, of course, be affected by steam addition, if this is the aroma recovery technique employed. Aroma separation can be conducted under vacuum. The temperature of the slurry can be elevated in advance of the aroma-separation step by heating the added water either before or after the slurry has been formed. The temperature change can be effected using heat recovered from other steps in the process, such as by using convention heat-exchangers. Preferably the water in step (b) is at a temperature of from 80 to 100° C. when it is mixed with the coffee. This is because it is cheaper to add hot water than it is to heat it with the beans or to use steam to heat the slurry. If the water is not heated before mixing with the coffee then it is added at a temperature of between 15 and 40° C. and the subsequent slurry is heated to 80 to 100° C. This option has an advantage of improved process simplicity. At this point in the process, after step (c), the slurry comprises soluble coffee solids, insoluble coffee solids which have been dearomatised and water. According to a further step (step (d)), the dearomatised slurry is passed to a first filtration device at a temperature of from 90 to 150° C., preferably 90 to 120° C. and more preferably 90 to 100° C., to form a first coffee extract and a first filter cake. In a preferred embodiment, dearomatised slurry is passed to a first filtration device at a temperature of from 140 to 150° C. This process therefore separates the majority of the soluble coffee solids and water from the insoluble coffee solids. The first filtration device can be one of several known filtration systems, including settling tanks, filters and centrifuges. Filters are preferred due to their capacity for efficient continuous processing and versatility in handling fine particles. It is most desired that a continuous filtration device is used. This allows efficient separation of the insoluble solids from the water with recovery rates of the soluble solids of greater than 90%. The coffee solids in the filter cake can be subjected to washing or pressing to increase the extraction of soluble coffee solids. The first coffee extract, which is a concentrated coffee liquor, may be stored for later use in the process or added directly to a later step in a continuous version of the process. According to a further step (step (e)), water is added to the first filter cake to form a reconstituted slurry having at least 12 wt % coffee solids. That is, water is added in an amount necessary to produce a slurry typically having slightly lower solids levels than in the first slurry formation step. Preferably the reconstituted slurry formed in step (e) has 12 to 30 wt % solids, more preferably 12 to 20 wt %. This level of solids is selected to achieve desirable pumpability. Again the reconstitution can be effected with heated water as necessary. Preferably the water in step (e) is at a temperature of from 80 to 100° C. This is because it is cheaper to add hot water and this also helps to achieve part of the temperature required in the following step. The heat may be recovered from other steps in the process. According to a further step (step (f)), the reconstituted slurry is thermally treated at a temperature of from 150 to 205° C., preferably from 170 to 205° C. and more preferably from 180 to 205° C. This heating is preferably conducted at an elevated pressure in order to enhance the extraction rate. A preferred pressure is from 2 to 30 Bar, such as 15 Bar. This heat treatment is preferably conducted for from 5 minutes to 2 hours, preferably 5 to 15 minutes, preferably 5 to 10 minutes. In an alternative embodiment the duration may be 15 to 25 minutes. During this step some of the insoluble coffee solids are hydrolysed into soluble solids which can then be recovered. This step may be conducted using a plug flow reactor. At this point in the process the slurry again comprises soluble coffee solids, insoluble coffee solids and water. This can be subjected to a flash treatment where a pressure drop allows the removal of any unwanted aroma flavours. According to a further step (step (g)), the thermally-treated reconstituted slurry is passed to a second filtration device to form a second coffee extract and a second filter cake. The filtration device may be any filtration device as discussed above. This serves to separate a coffee liquor containing dissolved soluble coffee solids from the insoluble coffee solids. The second filter cake can again be washed and/or pressed to recover additional coffee extract. The second coffee extract generally has a lower soluble solids concentration than the first coffee extract. The second coffee extract, which is a concentrated coffee liquor, may be stored for later use in the process. According to a further step (step (h)), the first and second coffee extracts are combined to form a third coffee extract. The two coffee extracts are generally combined to provide the third by simple mixing. According to a further step (step (i)), the third coffee extract is concentrated to form a fourth coffee extract having 35 to 70 wt % coffee solids, preferably 35 to 65 wt % and more preferably 40 to 50%. When adding in the aroma in the following step (j), a level of solids of from 55 to 60% after step (i) is preferred in order to allow the dilution to achieve a useful final concentration. This serves to provide a coffee extract suitable for use as a concentrate (i.e. flowable) or for use in a drying process to produce a dried product (i.e. less water to remove). Preferably step (i) is conducted in an evaporator unit. According to a further step (step (j)), the coffee aroma fraction (from step (c)) is added to the fourth coffee extract to form a liquid, coffee-extract product. This improves the flavour of the extract without compromising the solids level. The aroma is added back after the concentration step to avoid loss of the limited amounts of the aroma from the product. The resultant coffee extract preferably has 35 to 65 wt % and preferably, 45 to 65 wt % coffee solids. Preferably the coffee-extract product is a soluble powder. That is, the method further comprises a step (k) of drying the liquid coffee-extract product to form a soluble powder. Preferably the drying step is freeze-drying since this helps to retain the improved aroma profile of the product. Preferably the powder product has a mean particle size of from 200 to 3000 microns, more preferably 500 to 2000 microns. Alternatively, if a liquid coffee concentrate product is desired, then the process may include a further step after step (L) after step (j) in which the extract is diluted to lower the solids levels, such that the final product has a soluble solids content of 25 to 55 wt %, preferably 25 to 35%. This is a suitable solids level for a liquid concentrate. The coffee solids remaining after step (g) can be processed as a waste stream and may be incinerated to provide energy for the process (such as for heating water). Alternatively, the second filter cake may be subjected to a further high temperature extraction process to obtain a further coffee extract to be combined in step (h) with the first and second coffee extracts to form the third coffee extract. Suitable conditions for this further high temperature processing step are temperatures of from 190 to 215° C. This heat treatment is preferably conducted for from 5 minutes to 2 hours, preferably 15 to 25 minutes. This further step may be conducted using a further set of slurry formation and filtration steps, or using a conventional extraction technique. In general, the claimed method involves the use of less water than a conventional extraction method. The use of high solids levels reduces energy consumption for the associated concentration steps. The process also allows for efficient recycling of heat between the different stages with the addition of heated water at different stages and heat which can be recovered from the high temperature extraction step products. Preferably the method further comprises packaging the coffee-extract product. Accordingly to a preferred embodiment of the method, the method comprises: (a) providing roast and ground coffee having a mean particle size of from 200 to 600 microns; (b) mixing the roast and ground coffee with water to form a first slurry containing 15 to 30 wt % coffee solids, (c) passing the first slurry through an aroma-separation step to recover a coffee aroma fraction and to form a dearomatised slurry; (d) passing the dearomatised slurry to a first filtration device at a temperature of from 90 to 100° C. to form a first coffee extract and a first filter cake; (e) adding water to the first filter cake to form a reconstituted slurry having at least 12 wt % coffee solids; (f) thermally treating the reconstituted slurry at a temperature of from 180 to 205° C.; (g) then passing the thermally-treated reconstituted slurry to a second filtration device to form a second coffee extract and a second filter cake; (h) combining the first and second coffee extracts to form a third coffee extract; (i) concentrating the third coffee extract to form a fourth coffee extract having 35 to 60 wt % coffee solids; (j) adding the coffee aroma fraction to the fourth coffee extract to form a liquid, coffee-extract product. This preferred embodiment can be freely combined with all further features of the first aspect. According to a further aspect there is provided a coffee-extract product obtainable by the method described herein. The finished instant coffee product shows an improved flavour with less process flavours and an improved flavour closer to freshly brewed coffee. Undesired process sourness created through processing at higher temperatures is also reduced. The present inventors have found that the above described process leads to a unique instant coffee product (i.e. liquid coffee concentrate or soluble coffee powder). In particular, the product has an improved aroma and mouthfeel compared to conventional commercially available coffee products. The inventors have sought to identify the unique properties of the product which give rise to the observed improvements in aroma and mouthfeel. The process results in the presence of an insoluble coffee sediment fraction within the product. This fraction superficially resembles the roast and ground coffee additive often added to coffee products to improve the aroma of conventional coffee extracts. However, the insoluble coffee sediment fraction is present in the product as a direct consequence of the process and does not require an additional step of supplementing the coffee extract with roast and ground coffee. Accordingly, the product of the invention can be characterised by the presence of an insoluble coffee sediment fraction which distinguishes over commercially available coffee products which have not been supplemented with additional roast and ground coffee. Surprisingly, the inventors have found that the insoluble coffee sediment fraction obtained as a direct consequence of the process is less likely to sediment out of the extract than a post-added roast and ground coffee extract. This is observed in the final beverage where there is markedly reduced sediment or scum deposited on the wall of a receptacle after the beverage is swirled within the receptacle. The insoluble coffee sediment fraction obtained with the process described above further differs from the insoluble coffee sediment fraction observed for coffees with a conventional addition of a roast and ground coffee additive. This is because the fraction has undergone the coffee extraction process, being exposed to heated aqueous environments, which changes the balance of carbohydrates in the insoluble coffee material. Accordingly, the product of the invention can be characterised by a carbohydrate analysis of the insoluble coffee sediment fraction which distinguishes over commercially available coffee products which have been supplemented with additional roast and ground coffee. In addition, the process results in a higher oil fraction in the coffee product. This is a consequence of the finer coffee particle grind size used in the method. Since a finer grind exposes more surface area of the coffee for extraction, it is understood that a greater amount of oil is released in the extraction process. Accordingly, the product of the invention can be characterised by the presence of a higher oil fraction which distinguishes over commercially available coffee products obtained by conventional extraction processes. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an instant coffee composition for forming a coffee beverage, wherein the composition comprises at least 6 wt % of an insoluble coffee sediment fraction, the insoluble coffee sediment fraction comprising, when analysed after acid hydrolysis, 1 wt % or less arabinose. The insoluble coffee sediment fraction is the sediment obtained using the repeated centrifugation process described herein. It represents the solid material (not oils) present in the product which are insoluble in water. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an instant coffee composition for forming a coffee beverage, wherein the composition comprises an insoluble coffee sediment fraction, the insoluble coffee sediment fraction comprising, when analysed after acid hydrolysis, 1 wt % or less arabinose, and wherein the composition comprises at least 0.8 wt % coffee oils by dry weight, preferably from 1 to 5 wt % coffee oils. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an instant coffee composition for forming a coffee beverage, wherein the composition comprises at least 6 wt % of an insoluble coffee sediment fraction and at least 0.8 wt % coffee oils by dry weight, preferably from 1 to 5 wt % coffee oils. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an instant coffee composition for forming a coffee beverage, wherein the composition comprises at least 6 wt % of an insoluble coffee sediment fraction, the insoluble coffee sediment fraction comprising, when analysed after acid hydrolysis, 1 wt % or less arabinose and wherein the composition comprises at least 0.8 wt % coffee oils by dry weight, preferably from 1 to 5 wt % coffee oils. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an instant coffee composition for forming a coffee beverage, wherein the composition comprises at least 6 wt % of an insoluble coffee sediment fraction and wherein the composition when analysed by wet laser diffraction at a 1.5 wt % concentration has a monomodal particle size distribution. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an instant coffee composition for forming a coffee beverage, wherein the composition comprises an insoluble coffee sediment fraction comprising, when analysed after acid hydrolysis, 1 wt % or less arabinose and wherein the composition when analysed by wet laser diffraction at a 1.5 wt % concentration has a monomodal particle size distribution. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided an instant coffee composition for forming a coffee beverage, wherein the composition when analysed by wet laser diffraction at a 1.5 wt % concentration has a monomodal particle size distribution, and wherein the composition comprises at least 0.8 wt % coffee oils by dry weight, preferably from 1 to 5 wt % coffee oils. In each of the above aspects relating to an instant coffee composition, the term “instant” encompasses both a dried powder product, such as a soluble coffee powder, and a liquid coffee extract (e.g. 30 wt % coffee solids (soluble and insoluble) in water). Preferably the composition is dried, more preferably spray- or freeze-dried, or vacuum dried. Such dried products tend to have a longer product life. The compositions preferably comprises from 7.5 to 15 wt % of the insoluble coffee sediment fraction. This amount of the insoluble coffee sediment fraction provides a well-balanced aroma without having an unduly large amount of insoluble material which can adversely affect the mouthfeel and can cause undesirable sediment. Preferably the insoluble coffee sediment fraction comprises, when analysed after acid hydrolysis, from 0.5 to 1 wt % arabinose. Preferably the insoluble coffee sediment fraction comprises, when analysed after acid hydrolysis, less than 5 wt % galactose, preferably from 2 to 4 wt % galactose. Preferably the instant coffee composition comprises at least 1 wt % coffee oils by dry weight, preferably from 1.5 to 5 wt % coffee oils. The increased levels of oil improve the mouthfeel of the product. The oil is obtained as a consequence of the process and has been found to be well distributed within the extract, helping to improve the mouthfeel without undesirable oil slicks being visible on the final beverage. Preferably the instant coffee composition when analysed by wet laser diffraction at a 1.5 wt % concentration (solids) has unimodal particle size distribution. This distinguishes over those products where roast and ground coffee is added as a supplement to a soluble coffee powder (generally in the coffee extract before drying). Specifically, conventionally milling techniques which fracture coffee beans generally give rise to a bimodal distribution based on the fracturing of the coffee beans, with a lower peak resulting from the finest cell wall fragments. In contrast, the retained coffee particles after the method of the invention, or which are retained in a conventional extract having escaped a percolation column, have a bimodal distribution. Preferably under the same particle measurement the instant coffee composition also has a D50 of less than 10 microns, preferably from 2.5 to 7.5 microns. This fine particle size reflects the influence on the extract obtained from the above described coffee process. Indeed, the particle size distribution observed is unusual, since the D90 is typically greater than 30 microns, reflecting a broad particle size distribution. Preferably the composition consists of coffee. That is, preferably the coffee composition does not include any non-coffee components or additives. The quantification and analysis of the insoluble coffee sediment fraction requires the separation of the insoluble coffee solids from the soluble coffee solids. In order to facilitate this assessment for a liquid coffee product, it is necessary to dry the product to a powder so that the same analysis can be performed. To isolate and quantify the insoluble coffee sediment fraction (also known as sediment), 30 grams of a given coffee sample (dry powder) is added to 70 grams of boiling water and shaken for 2 minutes. The sample is then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10,000 g. After centrifugation the supernatant is decanted off and the sediment re-dissolved with 70 grams of boiling water, shaken for 2 minutes and then centrifuged again under the same conditions as above. This washing process is repeated 3 times for a total of four centrifugation steps. The sediment from the final wash is then freeze dried and then the sediment percentage is related to the starting sample of 30 g (e.g. 1.8 g of sediment represents a 6 wt % insoluble coffee sediment fraction). Before any analysis is carried out the dried sediment sample is homogenised by simple stirring. In view of the method for analysing the insoluble coffee sediment fraction, the fraction does not include any coffee oils which may be present, even though these would also be considered insoluble. This is because the oil will be readily separated in the centrifugation steps. To test the carbohydrates within the isolated insoluble coffee sediment fraction a total carbohydrate analysis is carried out using high performance anion exchange-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), according to ISO 11292-1995. The sample is prepared by mixing the already-isolated sediment with 50 ml of 1M HCl and then shaking the sample for 150 minutes at 95° C. Quantification of the monosaccharides are carried out by analysing external standards of the monosaccharides as usual. To determine the particle size distribution of the instant coffee product a Particle size distribution analysis was carried out using a Malvern® Mastersizer 3000 with Hydro MV tank. 1.5 g of sample (±0.0005 g) was made up to 100 g (±0.05 g) with deionised water boiled at 100° C., stirred for 60 seconds, cooled slightly, and added dropwise into the Malvern® unit to achieve obscuration around 10%. An average of 3 readings were taken. Again, in order to facilitate this assessment for a liquid coffee product, it is necessary to dry the product to a powder so that the same analysis can be performed. To determine the oil content, samples of the product (firstly dried if the product is a liquid coffee concentrate) were assessed using Soxtec H6. 2 g of sample was mixed with Petroleum Ether 40-60, boiled for 2 hours and then rinsed for approx. 0.5 hours. The resulting condensate is then heated to recover the solvent. The assessment of oil levels in this way is well known in the art. In some embodiments the instant coffee compositions of the present invention may be blended with a conventional coffee obtained by known methods. For example, a product might contain 10-100%, such as 20 to 50% of the coffee described herein, blended with the balance of a conventional coffee. While this can be readily achieved for a liquid product, a soluble product might be formed from a mixed liquid extract or by dry mixture of different powder products. This may be advantageous where the mouthfeel and taste benefits of the invention are to be moderated to provide a closer to conventional beverage experience. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE The invention will now be described further with respect to the figures, in which: FIG. 1 shows a flow-chart of the steps of the present invention. FIG. 2 shows a plot of the viscosity of various samples at different shear rates. FIG. 3 shows sensory data from a trial. DETAILED DESCRIPTION As shown in FIG. 1 , the method for the manufacture of a coffee-extract product includes a number of steps. In step (a) roast and ground coffee is provided having a mean particle size of from 100 to 600 microns, preferably 200 to 600 microns. Within this range, larger sizes are favoured for liquid extract products, whereas smaller sizes are favoured for dried soluble coffee products. In step (b) the roast and ground coffee with water 5 to form a first slurry 10 containing 15 to 30 wt % coffee solids. The water 5 is added at a temperature of from 80 to 100° C., and preferably from 90 to 95° C. The solids level is determined by the particle size, since a minimum amount of water 5 is used as necessary to obtain a pumpable slurry 10 . The larger the particle size, the more water 5 is required (the lower the solids) to achieve a pumpable slurry 10 . In step (c) the first slurry is passed through an aroma-separation step to recover a coffee aroma fraction 15 and to form a dearomatised slurry 20 . A typical approach to this method involves the addition of steam to the pumpable slurry 10 where the vapours are treated in a spinning cone treatment unit. In step (d) the dearomatised slurry 20 is passed to a first filtration device at a temperature of from 90 to 150° C., such as 90 to 100° C., to form a first coffee extract 25 and a first filter cake 30 . The temperature is retained from the preceding step or can be further increased to increase the extraction yield. The filter cake 30 may be washed and is pressed to obtain the largest possible amount of soluble coffee solids. In step (e) water 5 is added to the first filter cake 30 to form a reconstituted slurry 35 having at least 12 wt % coffee solids. The water 5 is preferably hot and there may be mechanical agitation to break up the first filter cake 30 . The amount of water required to reconstitute a slurry tends to be higher than that required in step (b). In step (f) the reconstituted slurry 35 is thermally treated at a temperature of from 150 to 205° C., such as 180 to 205° C. to form a thermally-treated reconstituted slurry 40 . That is, it is pumped through a heat-treatment unit, such as a plug-flow reactor. Residence times in the heat treatment are typically at least 5 minutes to ensure good extraction. In step (g) the thermally-treated reconstituted slurry 40 is passed to a second filtration device to form a second coffee extract 45 and a second filter cake 50 . The second filter cake 50 may be washed and is pressed to obtain the largest possible amount of soluble coffee solids. The temperature in this step may be retained from the preceding step, or may be lowered as heat is recovered for use in step (b), such as down to a temperature of from 80 to 100° C. The second filter cake 50 may then be burned in step M to produce heat for the process, or may be subjected to a further high temperature extraction step M to obtain a further coffee extract 52 . In step (h) the first coffee extract 25 and the second coffee extract 45 are combined to form a third coffee extract 55 . Other aqueous coffee extracts may also be added in this step, such as further coffee extract 52 . In step (i) the third coffee extract 55 is concentrated to form a fourth coffee extract 60 having 35 to 70 wt % coffee solids, such as 35 to 60 wt % coffee solids. In step (j) the coffee aroma fraction 15 is added to the fourth coffee extract 60 to form a liquid, coffee-extract product 65 . The liquid coffee extract product 65 may be treated in step K to form a dried coffee product, such as a soluble coffee powder 70 . The liquid coffee extract product 65 may be diluted in step L to form a liquid coffee concentrate 80 . In FIG. 3 the current technology is represented by the smallest quadrilateral. The other two quadrilaterals represent different Prototypes with 70% current and 30% new technology products. The axis are: positive x (Viscous); positive y (Turbid); negative x (powdery); negative y (dry). The present invention will now be described further in relation to the following non-limiting example. Example 1 Roast whole beans were ground to between 200 μm and 400 μm in a 3 stage roller grinder. The roast and ground coffee was slurried with water at 20° C.-30° C. at a ratio of 25% Coffee to 75% water. The slurry was fed forward into a heat exchanger and heated to 95° C. before moving into a spinning cone column where aroma was stripped from the slurry. Upon exit of the spinning cone the slurry was fed forward through a heat exchanger, raising the temperature to between 120° C. and 150° C. for 2 to 5 minutes. The slurry was then fed into a filter separating the coffee liquor from the grounds. The grounds were then subjected to 2 further washing steps at 130° C. to 150° C. to remove additional solids. The grounds were then re-slurried at a ratio of 12% to 17% solids with fresh water. The resulting slurry was fed forward to a hydrolysis step where it was heated to between 180° C. and 205° C. (185° C.) and held for between 5 and 20 minutes. The resulting slurry was then cooled to below 100° C. before passing through a second filtering step repeating the separation and washing of the first separation step. The coffee extracts obtained from each filtration step were combined and concentrated. The aroma compounds stripped from the first slurry where then added to the mixture. The fully combined three components were then freeze-dried with a conventional process to obtain a soluble coffee powder. The process recovered an incremental yield of 2% roasted coffee over current technologies with reduced water usage. Example 2 Arabica and/or Robusta beans were roasted and ground, using a 3-stage roller grinder, to a mean particle size of 300 μm. The ground coffee was then slurried with water at 20-25° C. at a ratio of 25% coffee to 75% water. The slurry was fed forward into a heat exchanger and heated to 70° C. before moving into a spinning cone column where aroma was stripped from the slurry. The slurry was then fed into a filter at a temperature of 95° C. separating the coffee liquor from the grounds. The grounds were then subjected to 2 further washing steps to remove additional solids. The grounds were then re-slurried at a ratio of 12% to 17% solids with fresh water. The resulting slurry was fed forward to a plug-flow reactor (hydrolysis step) where it was heated to 170° C. and held for 5-10 minutes. The resulting slurry was then cooled to below 100° C. before passing through a second filtering step repeating the separation and washing of the first separation step. The coffee extracts obtained from each filtration step were combined and concentrated. The aroma compounds stripped from the first slurry where then added to the mixture. The fully combined three components were then freeze-dried with a conventional process to obtain a soluble coffee powder. The product of this example was found to have more body/mouthfeel than products produced using current technology. Example 3 A coffee slurry was prepared as described in Example 1. The slurry was fed forward into a heat exchanger and heated to 95° C. before moving into a spinning cone column where aroma was stripped from the slurry. Upon exit of the spinning cone the slurry was fed forward through a heat exchanger, raising the temperature to between 145-150° C. for 4 to 5 minutes. The slurry was then fed into a filter separating the coffee liquor from the grounds. The grounds were then subjected to 2 further washing steps at 140° C. to remove additional solids. The slurry was then fed into a filter separating the coffee liquor from the grounds. The grounds were then re-slurried at a ratio of 12% to 17% solids with fresh water. The resulting slurry was fed forward to a plug-flow reactor (hydrolysis step) where it was heated to 200° C. and held for 7-10 minutes. The resulting slurry was then cooled to below 100° C. before passing through a second filtering step repeating the separation and washing of the first separation step. The coffee extracts obtained from each filtration step were combined and concentrated. The aroma compounds stripped from the first slurry where then added to the mixture. The fully combined three components were then freeze-dried with a conventional process to obtain a soluble coffee powder. The product of this example was found to have more body/mouthfeel than products produced using current technology. Example 4 Arabica and/or Robusta beans were roasted and ground, using a 3-stage roller grinder, to a mean particle size of 400 μm. The ground coffee was then slurried with water at 20-25° C. at a ratio of 15% coffee to 85% water. The remainder of the process was conducted as per example 1. The resulting product has lower levels of oil than the product of example 1. Example 5 Samples obtained by the method described herein were assessed in comparison to a range of commercially available soluble coffee products. As can be seen from the comprehensive testing, the products obtained by the process are new and can be readily distinguished from products obtained from conventional processes.

Examples 1-6 are commercially available products, of which 2 and 4 are products supplemented with added roast and ground coffee additives (designated “whole bean instant” in the table). It should generally be appreciated that levels of oil in Robusta beans are lower than in Arabica beans. This is reflected with the generally lower levels of oil in products comprising Robusta beans, include inventive example 9. Sample 10 is a dark Brazil known for high oil levels. As can be seen, there are low levels of oil in the pure instant coffees, i.e. samples 1, 3, 5 and 6, which have not been supplemented with roast and ground coffee additives. The oil levels are slightly higher in samples 2 and 4 due to the oil content of the roast and ground coffee additives, with sample 2 containing approximately 5% roast and ground coffee and Sample 4 containing more roast and ground coffee. Samples 7, 8 and 10 contain high levels of oil due to the fine grind of roasted coffee in the new process which releases more oil into the extract. As can be seen, no conventional soluble coffee products contain significant levels of oil. Indeed, it is speculated that the levels of oil observed for some of these products is added afterwards to the surface of the dried powder to improve its aroma. The only prior art products which contain high oil levels are a consequence of the addition of roast and ground coffee additives in the product. In contrast, the method described herein achieves high levels of oil, even for Robusta bean products. Sediment Levels Sediment levels were determined by taking 30 grams of a given coffee sample added to 70 grams of boiling water and shaken for 2 minutes. The sample is then centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10,000 g. After centrifugation the supernatant is decanted off and the sediment re-dissolved with 70 grams of boiling water, shaken for 2 minutes and then centrifuged again under the same conditions as above. This washing process is repeated 3 times for a total of four centrifugation steps. The sediment from the final wash is then freeze dried and then the sediment percentage is related to the starting sample of 30 g (e.g. 1.8 g of sediment represents a 6 wt % insoluble coffee sediment fraction).

Examples 1-6 are commercially available products, of which 4, 5 and 6 are products supplemented with added roast and ground coffee additives. As can be seen, all commercially available instant coffee products have some level of insoluble coffee sediment fraction. This is expected to be small fragments of coffee cell walls which pass through the extraction system into the coffee extracts. The levels of the insoluble coffee sediment fraction typically increase for those products supplemented with added roast and ground coffee additives. As can be seen, the products produced according to the method described herein all have significantly higher levels of insoluble coffee sediment fraction than instant coffee products which have not been supplemented with added roast and ground coffee additives.

Examples 1-6 are commercially available products, of which 4, 5 and 6 are products supplemented with added roast and ground coffee additives. The sediment quantification method with multiple centrifugation steps allows for a large amount of very fine particles to be recovered. Particle size distribution has been measured with the Malvem® 3000 after making a 1.5% hot brew of the dried product, for example, 3 g of dried product in 200 ml of hot water. 3 classes of sediment can be distinguished: Class 1 L'Or Intense, Kenco Rich and Carte Noir: Unimodal distribution D10: <1.5 and D90: <15 μm Relative low amount of sediment <5.5% wt The very small particle size (such as low D90) perhaps reflects the way in which these particles have escaped from the extraction column into the extract, or mannans which have sedimented in the evaporator. Class 2: Kenco Milicano, Nescafe Gold and Azera clearly differs from class 1 and 3 Bi-modal distribution (2 peaks) peak 1 between 1 and 10 μm and peak 2 between 10 and 100 μm. Class 3: Inventive Samples Unimodal distribution but broader distribution than class 1 D10: >1.0 and D90: >15 μm and relative higher amount of sediment such as >7.5% wt.

Examples 1-6 are commercially available products, of which 4, 5 and 6 are products supplemented with added roast and ground coffee additives. As can be seen, the insoluble coffee sediment fraction of the products of the invention has a level of Arabinose broadly similar to that of a soluble coffee product which has not been supplemented with roast and ground coffee. Typically it also has a lower level of galactose than a soluble coffee product which has been supplemented with roast and ground coffee Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is considered that the high levels of arabinose in the supplemented products is a consequence of the presence of the unextracted coffee material. In contrast, for the inventive products, the levels are lower reflecting the fact that the arabinose has already been extracted into the soluble coffee fraction by the process of the invention. Sensory Testing 2 prototypes of the product of the invention were combined with product from current technology in a ratio of 30 (POI):70 (current product). These were then tested in a set with an additional sample of 100% current technology product. The 3 samples were given to a panel of sensory experts who were then asked to pair the products according to similarities/dissimilarities to the third. The results indicate that even at levels of only 30% in a blend with current products the prototype is considered more viscous/dry and powdery-all attributes contributing to mouthfeel/body. The levels correlate directly with the tribology data. More oil means more lubrication which means more mouthfeel/body. The effects are shown in FIG. 3 . Collapse Temperature Crystalline products have a well-defined “eutectic” freezing/melting point, this point is called its collapse temperature. When freeze-drying a concentrated coffee extract, the extract is heated up from an initial frozen temperature of about −50° C. under a vacuum. This allows the water content to sublime away. The rate of heating depends on the extract and there is a collapse temperature above which the product will have melt-back and be compromised. The temperature and pressure can then be raised on subsequent cycles until evidence of collapse or melt-back is seen, indicating that the product was too warm. Surprisingly the inventors found that the collapse temperature for several samples of the inventive product were higher than that for their standard coffee products. Rheological Behaviour of Samples 1 Alta Rica 2 Nescafe Gold Blend 3 Kenco Really Rich 4 Milicano 5 Percol 6 Kenco Really Rich 7 NGC Colombian 8 NGC Central 9 NGC Robusta 10 NGC Brazil Samples were prepared with 10 g of coffee dissolved in 40 g of water at 85° C. Full dissolution was achieved with 2 minutes stirring with a 25 mm stirring bar at 150 rpm. These samples were tested with simple shear sweeps between shear rates of 0.01-1000 s −1 using a Discovery HR-2 Rheometer, sample volume 8 ml, with the circulation bath set to minus 4° C. The samples were studied at temperatures of 20 and 65° C. and at concentrations of 1.5 and 20 wt %. The data has then been fitted to the Quemada model which develops insights into fluid rheology based on the theory of internal structural units (SUs) suspensions. Within concentrated systems the single particles and small flocs may form increasingly larger groups the size of which will be dependent on the shear rates applied. Therefore since viscosity (n) is a function of structure (η=f(s)). And the structure is dependent on the levels of shear applied (as increased shear rates will merely act to disperse the macro and meso-structures of the flocs into the individual sub-units), the viscosity can be expressed in terms of the packing fraction/compactness since the more compact the SU's the higher the packing and therefore the more structure (viscosity) there will be. This is because the compactness of the SU's will contribute to the level of structure; η ∞ = η F ( 1 - ϕ ϕ ∞ ) - 2 η 0 = η F ( 1 - ϕ ϕ 0 ) - 2 Where η is viscosity and ϕ is the measure of compactness. FIG. 2 shows the results from this measurement. In this plot the important information is provided by the intercepts of the plots with the y-axis, representing the initial structure of the test samples. The lines, from top to bottom, are samples 9, 8, 10, 4, 7, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5. We can conclude that at 20 wt % (i.e. concentrated samples) at 65° C. (close to temperature of consumption) that samples 4 (Milicano) and 7-10 have significantly higher no. This means that from a microstructural perspective at lower shear rates (1 s −1 ) which are representative of those during mastication and are reflective of mouthfeel, these samples have more structure relative to the other samples. This implies that at these lower shear rates the compactness of their structural units is higher i.e. better packing of the structural units. Tribology of the samples was also observed. “Tribology is the science and engineering of interacting surfaces in relative motion. It includes the study and application of the principles of friction, lubrication and wear.” Therefore the parameter to pay attention to is the μ max which represents the maximum friction observed for each sample. Since lubrication is indicative of mouthfeel here and a higher μ max indicates lower rates of lubrication which should translate to lower mouthfeel. It was observed that at 65° C. (consumption temp) samples 7, 8 and 10 have significantly lower values for μ max indicating lower friction and hence higher mouthfeel. The exception is sample 9 (Robusta blend) with lower oil content. Unless otherwise stated, all percentages herein are by weight. Although preferred embodiments of the invention have been described herein in detail, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that variations may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention or of the appended claims.","12342834"

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a coffee drink order processing apparatus, which is capable of rapidly providing a user with a coffee drink by using an unmanned coffee drink making machine, and an operating method thereof. BACKGROUND ART Recently, as the demand for coffee increases, various coffee shops have emerged, and the trend of placing importance on the quality of coffee becomes clear, and coffee drink making machines for making coffee drinks are also developed and distributed in various forms. In local coffee shops where many companies are located, many people gather at the coffee shop at the same time at the lunch time, so that there is a problem in that one person has to wait a long time to order a coffee drink. In relation to this, in recent days, as a part of an effort to reduce the waiting time for ordering coffee drinks, technologies, in which a kiosk for processing orders of coffee drinks is installed in a store, and then when users order coffee drinks through the corresponding kiosk, corresponding order requests are received by a central order processing system in the store and the order receptions are processed, are emerged. However, in the case of the order processing system using the kiosk, the user must go directly to the store and enter an order in the kiosk installed in the store, and wait for the coffee drink in the store until the coffee drink is completely made after entering the order, so that there is an unnecessary waiting time. Further, recently, as the robot technology and the artificial intelligence technology are developed, mechanical devices that can similarly mimic human behavior are being developed. As an example of such mechanical devices, unmanned coffee drink making machines which discharge and mix materials according to predetermined ratios and make coffee drinks have emerged. According to the development of the unmanned coffee drink making machine, in order to maximize the operating profit by minimizing the number of employees, such as management staffs and baristas, an unmanned coffee drink selling store, in which an unmanned coffee drink making machine that makes coffee on behalf of the barista is placed, has emerged. Accordingly, there is a need for research on an order processing system, which, in order to reduce the waiting time for ordering coffee drinks and the waiting time for the coffee drink to be made and come out, and enable a user to rapidly pick up the coffee drink in an unmanned coffee drink selling store, receives an order request for a coffee drink from a client terminal, such as a smart phone, of a user and makes the coffee drink in time when the user arrives at the store by using unmanned coffee drink making machines to support the user to immediately pick up the coffee drink without incurring a waiting time when the user arrives at the store.

When first location information is received from the client terminal 130 , the movement means information requesting unit 115 checks whether the current location of the client terminal 130 according to the first location information exists in the region included in the map data, and when it is checked that the current location of the client terminal 130 is included in the region included in the map data, the movement means information requesting unit 115 requests the transmission of information about a movement means to the unmanned coffee drink selling store from the client terminal 130 . When the information about a first movement means is received from the client terminal 130 as the information about the movement means to the unmanned coffee drink selling store, the movement speed checking unit 116 checks information on a first movement speed, which is recorded while corresponding to the first movement means, with reference to the movement means table. For example, when information indicating “walking” is received from the client terminal 130 as the information about the first movement means, the movement speed checking unit 116 may check “4 km/h”, which is recorded while corresponding to the first movement means of “walking”, as the information on the first movement speed with reference to the movement means table like Table 1. When the information on the first movement speed is checked, the movement time calculating unit 117 checks a movement route in the case where the client terminal 130 moves from the current location of the client terminal 130 to the unmanned coffee drink selling store based on the current location of the client terminal 130 according to the first location information with reference to the map data, and calculates an expected movement time to the unmanned coffee drink selling store of the client terminal 130 based on the first movement speed and the movement route. For example, when it is checked that the first movement speed is “4 km/h” through the movement speed checking unit 116 , and a distance according to the movement route from the current location of the client terminal 130 to the unmanned coffee drink selling store is “1 km”, the movement time calculating unit 117 may calculate an expected movement time of the client terminal 130 to the unmanned coffee drink selling store as “15 minutes”. When a reservation time obtained by deducting a first making time predetermined to be consumed for making the first coffee drink from the expected movement time elapses, the command transmitting unit 118 transmits a making-reservation command directing to start the making of the first coffee drink to a first unmanned coffee drink making machine among the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 . When the making-reservation command is received in the first unmanned coffee drink making machine, the first unmanned coffee drink making machine may make the first coffee drink and put the first coffee drink in a paper cup after the reservation time in response to the making-reservation command, and in this case, when the user of the client terminal 130 arrives at the unmanned coffee drink selling store, the user may immediately pick up the first coffee drink made according to the arrival time from the first unmanned coffee drink making machine, so that the user can immediately receive the first coffee drink without having to wait for a separate order or for making the coffee drink. In this case, according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the coffee drink order processing apparatus 110 may further include a making time table maintaining unit 119 . The making time table maintaining unit 119 stores and maintains a making time table in which information on a predetermined making time for a different coffee drink is recorded while corresponding to each of the plurality of different kinds of coffee drinks predetermined to be orderable. For example, in the making time table, information represented in Table 2 below may be recorded. TABLE 2 Plurality of different Information on making time of kinds of coffee drinks different coffee drinks Americano Three minutes Moca coffee Five minutes Latte Six minutes . . . . . . In this case, according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the command transmitting unit 118 may include a making time checking unit 120 , a reservation time calculating unit 121 , and a making-reservation command transmitting unit 122 . The making time checking unit 120 checks the information on the first making time recorded while corresponding to the first coffee drink with reference to the making time table. For example, when the first coffee drink is “Americano”, the making time checking unit 120 may check the making time of “three minutes” that is recorded while corresponding to “Americano” as the information on the first making time with reference to the making time table like Table 2. The reservation time calculating unit 121 calculates the reservation time obtained by deducting the first making time from the expected movement time. In relation to this, when the expected movement time calculated in the movement time calculating unit 117 is “15 minutes” and it is checked that the first making time is “three minutes”, the reservation time calculating unit 121 may calculate “12 minutes” that is obtained by deducting the first making time of “three minutes” from the expected movement time of “15 minutes” as the reservation time. When the reservation time for the first unmanned coffee drink making machine elapses, the making-reservation command transmitting unit 122 transmits the making-reservation command directing to start the making of the first coffee drink. That is, as described in the foregoing example, when the reservation time is calculated as “12 minutes”, the making-reservation command transmitting unit 122 may transmit a making-reservation command directing to start the making of “Americano” that is the first coffee drink to the first unmanned coffee drink making machine when “12 minutes” elapse, and in this case, the first unmanned coffee drink making machine starts to make “Americano” after “12 minutes” elapse in response to the making-reservation command to support the user to immediately pick up “Americano” without incurring a waiting time when the user arrives at the unmanned coffee drink selling store after “15 minutes”. In this case, according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the command transmitting unit 118 may further include a command checking unit 123 and a machine selecting unit 124 . When the reservation time calculating unit 121 completes the calculation of the reservation time, the command checking unit 123 checks other making-reservation commands directing to make coffee drinks pre-allocated to each of the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 . Further, the machine selecting unit 124 selects an unmanned coffee drink making machine, to which a making-reservation command according to the same reservation time as the reservation time is not allocated, among the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 as the first unmanned coffee drink making machine to be used for making the first coffee drink based on the result of the checking of other making-reservation commands directing to make the coffee drinks pre-allocated to each of the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 . That is, when the reservation time calculating unit 121 completes the calculation of the reservation time, since the making-reservation command directing to make the first coffee drink cannot be allocated to the unmanned coffee drink making machine to which the making-reservation command of the coffee drink according to the same reservation time as the reservation time is already allocated, the coffee drink order processing apparatus 110 according to the present invention checks other making-reservation commands directing to make coffee drinks, which are already allocated to each of the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 through the command checking unit 123 , and then, selects an unmanned coffee drink making machine, to which the same reservation time as the reservation time is not allocated, among the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 as the first unmanned coffee drink making machine based on the result of the check for other making-reservation commands through the machine selecting unit 124 to process a reservation order not to overlap. In this case, according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the coffee drink order processing apparatus 110 may further include a score table maintaining unit 125 which stores and maintains an evaluation score table in which quality evaluation scores calculated based on the evaluations of each of the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 by the plurality of users are recorded. For example, in the evaluation score table, information represented in Table 3 below may be recorded. TABLE 3 Plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines Quality evaluation score Unmanned coffee drink making machine 1 80 Unmanned coffee drink making machine 2 90 Unmanned coffee drink making machine 3 70 . . . . . . In relation to this, the evaluation score table like Table 3 may be established by performing a survey and the like for a making quality of a coffee drink of each machine on the plurality of users who has drunk coffee drinks made through the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 and calculating a quality evaluation score for each machine. In this case, when it is checked that there are two more unmanned coffee drink making machines, to which the making-reservation command according to the same reservation time as the reservation time is not allocated, among the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 , the machine selecting unit 124 may select an unmanned coffee drink making machine having the highest quality evaluation score among the two or more checked unmanned coffee drink making machines as the first unmanned coffee drink making machine to be used for making the first coffee drink. That is, when there are two more unmanned coffee drink making machines, to which the making-reservation command according to the same reservation time as the reservation time calculated through the reservation time calculating unit 121 is not allocated, among the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 , the machine selecting unit 124 may select an unmanned coffee drink making machine having the highest quality evaluation score among the two or more unmanned coffee drink making machines as the first unmanned coffee drink making machine with reference to the evaluation score table like Table 3. Further, according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, when the reservation time calculated by the reservation time calculating unit 121 is a negative value, the machine selecting unit 124 may receive state information related to a current operation state of each of the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 from the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 and select an unmanned coffee drink making machine, of which the current operation state is an idle state in which the making of the coffee drink is not being performed, among the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 as the first unmanned coffee drink making machine to be used for making the first coffee drink. In this case, the making-reservation command transmitting unit 122 may transmit an immediate-making command directing to immediately start the making of the first coffee drink to the first unmanned coffee drink making machine in response to the case where the reservation time is calculated as the negative value. That is, the reservation time calculated by the reservation time calculating unit 121 is the negative value, the user already arrives at the unmanned coffee drink selling store or is likely to arrive before the making of the coffee drink is completed, so that the machine selecting unit 124 may select an unmanned coffee drink making machine in the idle state in which the unmanned coffee drink making machine is not currently making the coffee drink among the plurality of unmanned coffee drink making machines 141 , 142 , and 143 as the first unmanned coffee drink making machine and the making-reservation command transmitting unit 122 may transmit the immediate-making command directing to immediately make the first coffee drink to the first unmanned coffee drink making machine.

BACKGROUND ART In general, a coffee bean grinder includes a hopper into which coffee beans are put, a grinding part that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper, and a discharge part that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part (for example, PTL 1). Moreover, among such coffee bean grinders, there is a coffee bean grinder that can adjust the grinding grade of coffee beans. With the coffee bean grinder, an adjustment dial is rotated to adjust the clearance between a grinder disc that is provided in the grinding part and that has radial protrusions and depressions and a prebreaker that is provided to face the grinder disc, and hence the grinding grade of coffee beans can be adjusted. The coffee beans thus ground are transferred to a paper filter or a portafilter, and then coffee or espresso can be extracted using a coffee extractor or an espresso machine. CITATION LIST Patent Literature PTL 1: Japanese Unexamined Utility Model Registration Application Publication No. 05-005032 SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem When the coffee beans thus ground are transferred to the paper filter or the portafilter, the following problems have been hitherto pointed out. That is, when the coffee beans thus ground are transferred to the paper filter or the portafilter, if a certain distance exists between the discharge part and the filter, the coffee beans may be scattered to the outside therefrom. To prevent this trouble, PTL 1 suggests a coffee bean grinder in which the discharge part is coupled with the filter to prevent coffee beans from being scattered to the outside. However, coffee beans for espresso are extra finely ground and have no fluidity. The extra finely ground beans may be clogged in a communication path in the middle, and in addition, it is difficult to uniformly put the coffee beams into the portafilter. Owing to this, the coffee beans have to be measured with a dedicated cup and transferred to the portafilter, and the coffee beans may be scattered to the outside at this time. In light of the problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a coffee bean grinder that can transfer ground coffee beans to a portafilter so as not to scatter the ground coffee beans to the outside and so as to obtain uniform workability without a gap. Solution to Problem That is, to solve the above-described problems, the present invention provides a coffee bean grinder including a hopper into which coffee beans are put; a grinding part that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper; and a discharge part that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part. In the coffee bean grinder, an attachment part to which a portafilter is attached so as to come into close contact with a lower end portion of the discharge part is provided. With this configuration, when coffee beans for espresso are extra finely ground, the coffee beans can be directly put into the portafilter. The coffee beans do not have to be transferred using a dedicated cup or the like, the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside, and the coffee beans are uniformly put. Accordingly, subsequent work can be markedly reduced. In addition, the attachment part has a recess portion to which a protruding piece provided at an outer periphery of the portafilter is fitted. With this configuration, the portafilter can be directly attached to the lower end portion of the discharge part. Accordingly, the portafilter does not require an additional new attachment when the portafilter is attached, and the portafilter can be attached at low cost. Furthermore, an upper surface portion of a filter basket for putting the coffee beans into the portafilter is aligned with the lower end portion of the discharge part or a lower surface portion of a close contact member provided continuously from the lower end portion. With this configuration, the portafilter comes into close contact, and hence the coffee beans can be put into the portafilter without a gap. The discharge part has a tapered portion in which an inner wall is widened downward. With this configuration, extra finely ground coffee beans can be dropped while being dispersed, the coffee beans do not adhere to an inner wall surface, and clogging in the discharge part does not occur. In addition, a hole portion for releasing inside air to outside is provided at the tapered portion. With this configuration, even when a space with respect to the tapered portion is closed with the portafilter, the air in the space can move from the inside to the outside. The coffee beans are dropped to the portafilter while being spread, and the coffee beans can be put into the portafilter without a gap. Advantageous Effects of Invention With the present invention, in the coffee bean grinder including the hopper into which the coffee beans are put, the grinding part that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper, and the discharge part that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part, the attachment part to which the portafilter is attached so as to come into close contact with the lower end portion of the discharge part is provided. Accordingly, when extra finely ground coffee beans are directly put into the portafilter, it is not required to transfer the coffee beans using a dedicated cup or the like, the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside, and the coffee beans can be uniformly put into the portafilter. Thus, subsequent work can be markedly reduced. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 illustrates an external appearance of a coffee bean grinder according to an embodiment of the present invention.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention is described below with reference to the drawings. A coffee bean grinder 1 according to this embodiment can grind coffee beans with various grinding grades. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the coffee bean grinder 1 includes a hopper 2 into which coffee beans can be put, a grinding part 3 that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper 2 , and a discharge part 4 that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part 3 . As illustrated in FIG. 3, the coffee bean grinder 1 includes, as a feature, an attachment part 5 to which a portafilter 6 for espresso is attached, at a lower end portion of the discharge part 4 , to allow the coffee beans discharged from the discharge part 4 to be put directly into the portafilter 6 . The coffee bean grinder 1 according to this embodiment is described below in detail. First, the hopper 2 provided at the coffee bean grinder 1 has an inverted conic shape. Roasted coffee beans can be put into the hopper 2 . The hopper 2 is formed of a transparent plastic resin or the like such that the amount of coffee beans can be visually recognized. The hopper 2 drops the coffee beans from an opening portion 21 provided at a lower end side of the hopper 2 toward the grinding part 3 . The grinding part 3 can grind the coffee beans dropped from the hopper 2 . In this case, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the grinding part 3 includes a grinder disc 32 and a prebreaker 31 . The grinder disc 32 has obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a provided on a surface of the grinder disc 32 . The prebreaker 31 can rotate in a state in which the clearance width between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 is adjusted. An adjustment mechanism that adjusts the clearance width between the grinder disc 32 and the prebreaker 31 is described. First, a shaft 33 of a motor 33 a that rotates the prebreaker 31 is provided to protrude from the center of the grinder disc 32 , is joined to the prebreaker 31 at a tip end portion of the shaft 33 , and rotates the prebreaker 31 . A bearing portion 31 a of the prebreaker 31 is rotatably fitted on the shaft 33 of the motor, and applies a force to the prebreaker 31 in a direction away from the grinder disc 32 via a spring 31 b that is provided on the outside of the bearing portion 31 a . In addition, slits 31 s and 33 s are respectively formed in the tip end portion of the shaft 33 of the motor 33 a and a center portion of the prebreaker 31 . A shear plate 34 is inserted into the slits 31 s and 33 s to transmit the rotational force of the shaft 33 to the prebreaker 31 . A circular protruding portion 31 c is formed at the center portion of the prebreaker 31 . A pressing portion 35 a that is provided at a shaft on a back surface side of an adjustment dial 35 is pressed to the circular protruding portion 31 c to move the prebreaker 31 toward the grinder disc 32 . When the grinding grade of coffee beans is adjusted by using the adjustment mechanism thus configured, the adjustment dial 35 is rotated, and the pressing portion 35 a provided at the center of the adjustment dial 35 is pressed toward the protruding portion 31 c of the prebreaker 31 . Then, the prebreaker 31 moves toward the grinder disc 32 against the force of the spring 31 b , and decreases the clearance width with respect to the grinder disc 32 . By rotating the motor 33 a , the prebreaker 31 is rotated via the shear plate 34 provided at the tip end of the shaft 33 . When the prebreaker 31 is rotated in this way, the coffee beans in the clearance with respect to the grinder disc 32 are finely ground by the obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a of the grinder disc 32 , and are discharged to the lower discharge part 4 . The discharge part 4 discharges the coffee beans discharged from the grinding part 3 downward. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the discharge part 4 includes a communication path 41 that communicates with a lower end portion of the grinding part 3 , and a tapered portion 42 that is provided to cover a lower outer peripheral portion of the communication path 41 . The communication path 41 is provided to extend from the lower side of the grinding part 3 along the vertical direction. With the communication path 41 , the extra finely ground coffee beans are dropped straight. If the communication path 41 is inclined, the coffee beans extra finely ground for espresso may adhere to a wall surface of the communication path 41 and cannot be discharged straight. In addition, if the coffee beans cannot be discharged, more coffee beans are required, and when coffee beans are ground with another grinding grade, the ground coffee beans are mixed with the previous coffee beans remaining in the communication path 41 . The mixture of the coffee beans changes the flavor. Owing to this, in this case, the coffee beans discharged from the lower side of the grinding part 3 are dropped straight vertically downward, and thus prevent the coffee beans from remaining in the communication path 41 . The tapered portion 42 is configured to disperse the coffee beans dropped from the communication path 41 , and has a tapered shape whose inside diameter increases downward. Since the tapered portion 42 has the tapered shape, the coffee beans can be prevented from adhering to the wall surface, and the coffee beans can be uniformly dropped into the portafilter 6 attached to the lower side of the tapered portion 42 . With this configuration, as a feature, the attachment part 5 for attaching the portafilter 6 and a paper bag 7 is provided at a lower end portion 43 of the tapered portion 42 . As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4, the attachment part 5 has a recess portion 51 and a groove portion 52 for attaching the portafilter 6 , at the outer periphery of the lower end portion 43 of the tapered portion 42 , and a bag holder 45 for attaching the paper bag 7 . As illustrated in FIG. 5, the portafilter 6 attached to the attachment part 5 has a recess portion at a tip end of a handle 61 . A filter basket 63 can be removably fitted to the recess portion. The filter basket 63 is configured to put coffee beans therein. Espresso is dripped from numerous pores 64 provided in a bottom surface of the filter basket 63 . The dripped espresso is ejected from a hole portion 65 (see FIG. 3 etc.) provided at the center of the portafilter 6 , and then is poured in a container such as a cup. A pair of left and right protruding pieces 66 are formed at an outer peripheral portion 62 of the portafilter 6 along the outer circumferential direction. The portafilter 6 can be used by attaching the protruding pieces 66 to an espresso machine or the like. The attachment part 5 to which such a portafilter 6 is attached can be attached so as to hermetically seal the inner space of the tapered portion 42 by using the protruding pieces 66 of the portafilter 6 . More specifically, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the attachment part 5 includes a fit member 50 a to which the portafilter 6 is fitted, and a close contact member 50 b with which an upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 of the portafilter 6 is brought into close contact when the portafilter 6 is attached to the fit member 50 a . The fit member 50 a has the recess portion 51 into which the protruding pieces 66 of the portafilter 6 can be inserted from below, and the groove portion 52 formed from the recess portion 51 along the circumferential direction. The portafilter 6 is attached by inserting the protruding pieces 66 into the recess portion 51 and rotating the protruding pieces 66 . The groove portion 52 is formed in a helical shape so that the protruding pieces 66 rise when the portafilter 6 is attached while being rotated. Thus, the portafilter 6 is pushed upward. Moreover, the close contact member 50 b is attached to a screw thread formed on an outer peripheral portion at a lower end of the tapered portion 42 . A sag portion 501 continuously sags from an inner wall surface of the tapered portion 42 . The filter basket 63 comes into close contact with the sag portion 501 . To prevent coffee beans from getting into a gap between the filter basket 63 and the sag portion 501 when the filter basket 63 is brought into close contact with the sag portion 501 , an inclined portion 502 that is curved along an inner wall surface of the filter basket 63 is provided. Thus, coffee beans dropped from above do not get into the gap with respect to an upper surface of the filter basket 63 . In addition, when the lower side of the tapered portion 42 is covered with the portafilter 6 , the inner space of the tapered portion 42 is hermetically sealed, and the inside may be pressurized as coffee beans are dropped. Then, the coffee beans may be hardly dropped from the communication path 41 , and may be clogged in the communication path 41 . Thus, in this case, a hole portion 44 is provided for releasing the air in the inner space of the tapered portion 42 to the outside. The hole portion 44 is provided to have a diameter that is smaller than the diameters of extra finely ground coffee beans and that allows the air to be released to the outside. Moreover, when such a hole portion 44 is provided, if the coffee beans adhere to the hole portion 44 , the hole portion 44 cannot release the air. Owing to this, the hole portion 44 is provided at a position that is in an upper portion of the tapered portion 42 and that is outside the communication path 41 . Since the hole portion 44 is provided at such a position, the hole portion 44 is not closed with the coffee beans, the air flows downward to a bottom portion of the filter basket 63 , spreads outward, and flows upward again. Thus, the coffee beans can be uniformly spread and put into the filter basket 63 . As illustrated in FIG. 7, the paper bag 7 is for a take-out of ground coffee beans, and can house coffee beans from an upper opening portion. The bag holder 45 to which the paper bag 7 is attached is provided with a lever 45 a that attaches the paper bag 7 to an outer peripheral portion of the communication path 41 so as to cover the discharge part 4 , and a spring (not illustrated) that presses a lower end portion of the lever 45 a toward the communication path 41 . The paper bag 7 is set to cover the discharge part 4 , and in this state, an area around the opening portion is pressed and fixed with the lever 45 a . Since the lever 45 a is provided at the outer peripheral portion of the communication path 41 in this way, the paper bag 7 can be pressed and fixed. In addition, when the portafilter 6 is attached and coffee beans are put into the portafilter 6 , a small amount of coffee beans remaining in the communication path 41 and the tapered portion 42 are dropped into the portafilter 6 by several times of knocking with the lever 45 a. A method of using the coffee bean grinder 1 thus configured is described next. First, when coffee beans for espresso are to be ground, roasted coffee beans are put into the hopper 2 . At this time, an amount of coffee beans that can exactly fill the portafilter 6 is put into the hopper 2 . At the time of putting the coffee beans into the hopper 2 , the portafilter 6 is attached to the lower end side of the discharge part 4 . When the portafilter 6 is to be attached, the protruding pieces 66 provided at the outer periphery thereof are fitted to the recess portion 51 , the handle 61 is turned in this state, and hence the protruding pieces 66 are held by the groove portion 52 . Then, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the inclined portion 502 that is a lower surface portion of the close contact member 50 b comes into close contact with the upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 . Then, in the state in which the portafilter 6 is attached, the adjustment dial 35 is rotated and set to extra fine grinding. Then, the pressing portion 35 a provided at the center of the adjustment dial 35 protrudes and presses the protruding portion 31 c of the prebreaker 31 . Thus, the prebreaker 31 moves toward the grinder disc 32 . The power is turned ON in this state to rotate the motor 33 a . Then, the coffee beans dropped from the opening portion 21 of the hopper 2 get into the area between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 , and the coffee beans are extra finely ground with the obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a of the grinder disc 32 . The ground coffee beans are dropped in the vertical direction from the lower side of the grinding part 3 via the communication path 41 , and are dropped into the filter basket 63 in a state in which the coffee beans are dispersed by the tapered portion 42 . At this time, since the upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 and the inclined portion 502 of the close contact member 50 b are in close contact with each other, the coffee beans can be put without a gap at the wall surface of the filter basket 63 . When the coffee beans thus extra finely ground in this way are dropped from the tapered portion 42 , the air cannot be released from the inner space of the tapered portion 42 that is hermetically closed with the portafilter 6 , and the inner space is pressurized. However, since the hole portion 44 is provided at the tapered portion 42 according to this embodiment, the air can be released from the hole portion 44 to the outside as the coffee beans are dropped as illustrated in FIG. 6. Thus, the coffee beans can be successively dropped. After the coffee beans have been put into the portafilter 6 in this way, the lever 45 a is knocked to drop the coffee beans adhering to the communication path 41 and so forth, and then the handle 61 of the portafilter 6 is rotated in the opposite direction to detach the protruding pieces 66 from the attachment part 5 . Then, mountain-shaped coffee beans are flattened and pressed, the portafilter 6 is attached to an espresso machine, and espresso is extracted. When coffee beans for coarse grinding are to be ground, as illustrated in FIG. 7, coffee beans are put into the hopper 2 and the paper bag 7 is attached. When the paper bag 7 is attached, the paper bag 7 is set to cover the discharge part 4 , and the area around the opening portion thereof is pressed and fixed with the lever 45 a. In the state in which the paper bag 7 is attached, the adjustment dial 35 is rotated and set to coarse grinding. Then, the pressing portion 35 a provided at the center of the adjustment dial 35 is retracted to the inside, the prebreaker 31 moves away from the grinder disc 32 , and the clearance between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 increases. When the power is turned ON and the motor 33 a is rotated in this state, the coffee beans dropped from the opening portion 21 of the hopper 2 get into the area between the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 , and the coffee beans are coarsely ground with the obliquely radial protrusions and depressions 32 a of the grinder disc 32 . The ground coffee beans are dropped in the vertical direction from the lower side of the grinding part 3 via the communication path 41 and the tapered portion 42 , and dropped into the paper bag 7 . After the coffee beans have been put into the paper bag 7 in this way, the lever 45 a is tilted on the opposite side, the paper bag 7 is removed, and the opening portion is welded, to put the coffee beans in the paper bag 7 up for sale as take-out coffee beans. With the above-described embodiment, in the coffee bean grinder 1 including the hopper 2 into which the coffee beans are put, the grinding part 3 that grinds the coffee beans fed from the hopper 2 , and the discharge part 4 that discharges the coffee beans ground by the grinding part 3 , the attachment part 5 to which the portafilter 6 is attached so as to come into close contact with the lower end portion of the discharge part 4 is provided. Accordingly, extra finely ground coffee beans can be directly put into the portafilter 6 , it is not required to transfer the coffee beans using a dedicated cup or the like, and the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside. In addition, the attachment part 5 has the recess portion 51 to which the protruding pieces 66 provided at the outer periphery of the portafilter 6 are fitted. Accordingly, the portafilter 6 does not require an additional new attachment when the portafilter 6 is attached, and the portafilter 6 can be attached at low cost. Furthermore, the upper surface portion 63 a of the filter basket 63 for putting the coffee beans into the portafilter 6 comes into close contact with the inclined portion 502 that is the lower surface portion of the close contact member 50 b . Accordingly, the coffee beans can be put into the portafilter 6 without a gap. The discharge part 4 has the tapered portion 42 in which the inner wall is widened downward. Accordingly, extra finely ground coffee beans do not adhere to the inner wall surface of the discharge part 4 , and clogging or the like in the discharge part 4 can be prevented from occurring. The hole portion 44 for releasing the inside air to the outside is provided at the tapered portion 42 . Accordingly, even when the space with respect to the tapered portion 42 is hermetically sealed with the portafilter 6 , the air in the space can be released from the hole portion 44 , and the coffee beans can be dropped and put into the portafilter 6 while the inside air is released. The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and can be implemented in various forms. For example, while coffee beans are ground at various grinding grades in the above-described embodiment, the invention can be applied to a coffee bean grinder dedicated to extra fine grinding for espresso. Moreover, while the coffee beans are ground using the prebreaker 31 and the grinder disc 32 in the above-described embodiment, the coffee beans may be ground by any of other methods. Furthermore, while the small hole portion 44 is provided at the tapered portion 42 in the above-described embodiment, it is not limited thereto. A large cylindrical hole may be provided at the tapered portion 42 and the inside air may be released. In this case, the inside diameter of the hole portion 44 may be a desirable diameter as long as the coffee beans are not scattered to the outside. While the close contact member 50 b is in close contact with the filter basket 63 in the above-described embodiment, the gap may be closed by bringing the lower surface of the tapered portion 42 into close contact with the upper surface of the filter basket 63 . In this case, the inner wall surface of the tapered portion 42 is aligned with the inner wall surface of the filter basket 63 , so that the coffee beans are not put on the upper surface of the filter basket 63 . While the inclined portion 502 is provided at the lower surface side of the close contact member 50 b in the above-described embodiment, the inclined portion 502 may have a shape that is inclined at a constant angle in addition to the surface having a curvature.

FIELD The present invention relates to the field of preparation of coffee beverages by a coffee machine using capsules. The invention more particularly relates to a method and capsule for producing a long liquid coffee extract having a thick and stable head of coffee foam (‘crema’). The invention also relates to a liquid coffee extract with crema. BACKGROUND The preparation of coffee using capsules containing coffee powder has reached a fast increasing commercial success due to the convenience of the coffee preparation, the cleanliness and the quality of the coffee obtained. In particular, for short and medium size coffee such as ristretto (25 ml), espresso (40 ml) or lungo (110 ml), certain existing coffee systems on the market enable to deliver coffees of high quality with a diversified aroma and taste but also a head of pure coffee foam with a uniform and smooth texture also called ‘crema’. The aroma and taste variations can generally be obtained by a careful selection of different blends of roast and ground coffee coming from various origins. Generally, the best short coffee extract is obtained under relatively high pressure of extraction (10-20 bars) and in a relatively short time (less than 60 seconds). An appealing texture of crema generally exhibits a shiny visual appearance and a uniform and very smooth texture without (too many) visible bubbles. The texture should also be persistent for a few tenths of seconds. If the bubbles collapse too rapidly or aggregate into larger ones, the coffee crema loses thickness and the texture providing the attractive mouth feel is poor. A coffee of longer size (i.e., about 230 ml) is usually not extracted at high pressure to avoid an over-extraction and/or the extraction of coffee compounds that can be at the origin of an undesirable taste. A solution for making a long coffee from a capsule may consist in making a smaller coffee volume than the final targeted volume under high pressure conditions and, adding hot water directly in the liquid coffee extract during or after coffee extraction. This method usually delivers what is called an “Americano” coffee. One problem is that the volume of crema is reduced by the addition of hot water. Generally, hot water will cause bubbles to collapse instantaneously or rapidly. U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,765 describes a sealed filter cartridge adapted for use in an automatic machine such as a coffee brewing machine. The coffee is usually prepared by pre-perforating the cartridge and injecting hot water in the cartridge at relatively low pressure. However, the problem is that the coffee obtained is generally considered as “filter coffee”. It is of relatively low intensity. It also exhibits no crema and forms at best a discontinuous thin soapy layer formed of large bubbles rapidly collapsing. Therefore, this method has proven unable to form an attractive crema on a long cup of coffee. Therefore, to date, it does not exist a long coffee liquid extract, obtained by extraction of roast and ground coffee from a capsule in a coffee machine, which exhibits a thick and stable head of foam (hereafter ‘crema’) that would be very appealing for coffee gourmets. It also does also not exist a method for preparing by extraction of roast and ground coffee with hot water in a capsule coffee system, such a long coffee extract. It also does not exist a capsule for a coffee machine capable of delivering such long liquid coffee extract. The purpose of the present invention is to propose a method for providing from a single-use capsule, processed in a coffee machine, a long coffee extract with ‘crema’ that presents a shiny visual appearance as well as a thick, homogeneous and uniform (unctuous) texture. SUMMARY The invention is contained in the appended claims here inserted by reference. The present invention relates to a method for producing a long coffee extract from a capsule in a coffee machine comprising: providing a capsule containing a predetermined dose of roast and ground coffee and the machine supplying hot water within the capsule, extracting liquid coffee extract from the capsule by rotating the capsule about its central axis in the machine for centrifuging and extracting the liquid coffee extract towards the periphery of the capsule while the machine continuing supplying hot water, the machine collecting the liquid coffee extract from the capsule and dispensing the coffee extract in a receptacle; wherein the liquid coffee extract is formed with coffee foam (i.e., ‘crema’) which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height higher than 15 mm in the receptacle, such coffee foam being stable by retaining more than 50% of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction and, wherein the roast and ground coffee has a weight of from 11 to 14 grams, a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 500 micrometer and a roasting degree of from 50 to 80 CTN. It was surprisingly found that a persistent coffee ‘crema’ can be obtained in a centrifugal extraction process by selecting certain coffee parameters, in particular, the weight, the coffee granulometry and the coffee roasting value. The liquid coffee extract is formed with coffee foam which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height even higher than 20 mm, preferably comprised between 20 and 35 mm, most preferably between 25 and 30 mm. The liquid coffee extract is stable after extraction by retaining even more than 60%, most preferably more than 64% of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction. In particular, it was surprisingly found that the coffee roasting degree influences the quality of the coffee crema, and particular, darker roasting were preferred. Roasting is generally a heat treatment on green coffee beans which modifies the physico-chemical bean properties (density, microstructure, oil migration, etc.) thereby resulting in the development of the aroma, flavour and colour of the beans. Preferably, optimal results were obtained when the roast and ground coffee has a roasting degree of from 55 to 70 CTN, more preferably of from 58 to 65 CTN. Such roasting degree essentially corresponds to a dark roasted coffee powder. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 350 micrometer. Preferably, roast and ground coffee has a fines content of from 10 and 30% in volume. Preferably, the fines content is preferably of from 15 to 30% in volume. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a weight of from 12 to 13.5 grams. With such a coffee weight, it is possible to produce coffee extract with excellent crema, high intensity but without over-extraction. Surprisingly, it was found that under these selected product and extraction process conditions, a persistent coffee crema can be obtained for a long coffee extract while also significantly avoiding the coffee over-extraction that generates undesired bitter or unpleasant flavour and/or taste notes. The liquid coffee extract as obtained by the method of the invention provides a long coffee liquid extract with good intensity and body. Generally, the intensity can be set higher than for long filter coffee. In particular, the liquid extract has preferably a coffee yield of from 20 to 30% wt. Preferably, the liquid extract has a total solids of from 1.0 to 1.55% wt, more preferably of from 1.25 to 1.55% wt. The coffee is not over-extracted so that the coffee is not bitter and the natural coffee aromatic notes (such as cereal, fruity or juicy notes) are promoted. The quality of coffee crema can be impacted by the water and/or coffee temperatures. The control of temperatures preferably involves the temperature of water before it is supplied to the capsule (i.e., “hot water temperature”) and the temperature of coffee as dispensed in the coffee receptacle (i.e., “in-cup temperature”). Preferably, hot water is heated before being supplied within the capsule at temperature comprised of from 70 to 95° C., more preferably, of from 75 to 90° C. In addition, the coffee extract is kept warm when collected to be dispensed at in-cup temperature of the coffee extract above 60° C., preferably above 65° C., most preferably of from 70° C. to 80° C. The in-cup temperature is a compromise between the need to not reduce the stability of crema with a too high temperature and the need to serve a coffee sufficiently hot for the consumer. The in-cup temperatures are preferably controlled by controlling the temperature of the collecting means which collects the liquid extract and/or of the dispensing means such as the coffee outlet of the machine. For instance, the collecting means can comprise an annular U-shaped collector associated with a heating means such as described in co-pending international patent application WO2010/089329. The extraction of coffee is generally obtained by rotating the capsule about its central axis in the coffee machine and passing hot water through the roast and ground coffee in the direction from the center to the periphery of the capsule. In other words, the extraction is obtained by creating centrifugation forces on the liquid circulating through the bed of coffee in the capsule; such forces generating a gradient of pressure of liquid which is prone to extract the coffee solid and volatile compounds from the coffee particles. The formed coffee extract is moved to the periphery of the capsule where it leaves the capsule through a plurality of peripheral outlets. Such peripheral outlets may, for instance, be perforated by perforated means of the machine and/or be pre-made before insertion of the capsule in the machine. In the preferred method, the hot water is supplied in the capsule until the capsule is filled under pressure with hot water. In the water filling step, the volume of water which is supplied in the capsule may vary but generally is sufficient to fully wet the coffee powder. The flow rate of the water in the filling step is controlled to not exceed a certain pressure in the capsule and to prevent blocking of the coffee flow. In general, the flow rate is lower than the flow rate during the subsequent coffee extraction step. Preferably, the water is filled in the capsule at a flow rate of about 80 to 150 ml/min. Such controlled hot water filling enables to improve the release of the coffee volatile compounds during extraction. The suitable prefilling volume of water may vary but is preferably about 0.5 to 3 times the net volume of roast and ground coffee in the capsule. Advantageously, during extraction of the coffee extract from the capsule, the flow of coffee extract passes a flow restriction means. The flow restriction means is preferably provided at or immediately close to the annular periphery of the capsule. The flow restriction means ensures a sufficient residence time of liquid in the capsule and an improved extraction of the coffee compounds. The restriction means can be formed by a spring-biased pressure ring that engages on the capsule to hinder the flow of coffee extract and is lifted to open a flow path under the effect of the pressure of the coffee extract acting thereon. This method surprisingly shows a great ability for producing high volume of unctuous ‘crema’ while still maintaining the characteristics of the coffee extract (yield, total solids) within preferred ranges. The mean flow rate of the hot water during extraction is more preferably of from 80 to 250 ml/min, even more preferably of from 120 to 200 ml/min. The flow rate can be controlled to control the coffee intensity and avoid coffee over-extraction. The flow rate of hot water can depend on the coffee blend which is selected. In a possible mode, the hot water flow rate is varied during extraction such as be increased or decreased in a continuous manner or stepwise. Moreover, the hot water flow rate can be controlled during at least two separate phases having different flow rate thresholds, even more preferably three separate phases with two or three different thresholds of flow rates. In the preferred method, the capsule is rotated to provide centrifugal forces in the capsule that forces heated water through the coffee and enables the coffee to be extracted at relatively low pressure. Preferably, during extraction of the liquid coffee extract, the mean value of the water pressure (“mean pressure”) supplied within the capsule is of from 700 mbar to 1 bar. The flow rate is influenced by the pressure in the system and the rotational speed. For this, the rotational speed is controlled to match the target(s) of water flow rate. The capsule can be rotated at a rotational speed is of from 3000 to 6000 rpm during extraction. The rotational speed can be increased or decreased during extraction to match a set value of flow rate or an increasing or decreasing profile of flow rates. In a possible mode, the flow rate is varied during extraction by applying two or three sequential phases; each having a set value of flow rate or an increasing or decreasing profile of flow rate. The invention further relates to a single-use capsule for producing a long coffee extract with a thick and stable coffee foam in a coffee machine containing a predetermined dose of roast and ground coffee having a weight of from 11 to 14 grams, a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 500 micrometer and a roasting degree of from 50 to 80 CTN, and, preferably a fines content of from 10 to 30% in volume. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a mean particle size D 4,3 of from 200 to 350 micrometer. Preferably, the roast and ground coffee has a fines content of from 15 to 30% in volume. The capsule of the invention is extractable in a centrifugal coffee machine to deliver a long coffee extract formed with coffee foam (‘crema’) which exhibits in a receptacle of reference an initial height larger than 15 mm, such coffee foam being stable after extraction by retaining more than 50% of its initial height at 180 seconds. Preferably, the capsule is extractable to form a liquid coffee extract with coffee foam which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height even higher than 20 mm, preferably comprised between 20 and 35 mm, most preferably between 25 and 30 mm. The capsule is also extractable to form a liquid coffee extract which is stable after extraction by retaining even more than 60% of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction. The stability is preferably between 60 and 80%. The capsule preferably may comprise a cup-shaped body forming a cavity containing the roast and ground coffee, a circular annular flange like rim and an upper wall member sealed onto the rim. The upper wall member can be a sealing membrane made of aluminium and/or polymer. The upper wall member may also be a lid or a membane with pre-made inlet and/or peripheral outlets. In order to reduce oxidation of the coffee powder, the capsule of the invention preferably forms by itself an oxygen-tight package or forms a package with very low oxygen permeability such as using barrier packaging materials such as EVOH and the like. It preferably contains the roast and ground coffee with saturation of the free volume with protective gas such as N 2 and/or CO 2 . The capsule may also forms a package permeable to oxygen but sealed by a secondary (over-)package which is oxygen-tight or with exhibits very low oxygen permeability with barrier packaging materials such as EVOH and the like. The internal volume of the capsule is sized as a function of the amount of roast and ground coffee contained in the capsule and to the volume of water to be received in for filling the capsule for pre-wetting the coffee before extraction. The suitable prefilling volume of water may vary but is preferably about 0.5 to 3 times the net volume of coffee. The invention also relates to the use of a capsule as aforementioned for the production of a liquid coffee extract. In particular, the invention relates to the use of a capsule for the production of a long coffee extract in a centrifugal coffee machine in which the capsule is rotated about its central axis for centrifuging and extracting the liquid coffee extract for producing a liquid coffee extract formed with coffee foam (i.e., ‘crema’) which exhibits in a receptacle of reference an initial height larger than 15 mm, preferably more than 20 mm, such coffee foam being stable after extraction by retaining more than 50%, preferably more than 60%, of its initial height at 180 seconds. The invention further relates to a liquid coffee extract having a volume of 230 (+/−5) ml obtained by extraction of roast and ground coffee from a capsule in a coffee machine, with a head of foam (i.e., crema) which exhibits, in a receptacle of reference, an initial height higher than 15 mm, preferably more than 20 mm in the receptacle of reference, such coffee foam being stable by retaining more than 50%, preferably more than 60%, of its initial height at 180 seconds after extraction. The crema stability is preferably between 60 and 80%. Preferably, the liquid coffee extract of the invention has a coffee yield of from 20 to 30% wt. Preferably, the liquid coffee extract of the invention a total solids of from 1.0 to 1.55% wt, preferably of from 1.25 to 1.55. Definitions In the present description, terms are utilized for which the definitions are given below. In the context of the present invention, the term “long coffee extract” represents a liquid coffee extract of 230 (+/−5) ml. The “extraction” is defined as the period the liquid coffee extract is dispensed from the capsule and collected in the receptacle. The “coffee weight” represents the weight of the predetermined dose of roast and ground coffee contained in the capsule in the sealed or storage packaging conditions of the capsule. The “roasting degree” refers to the CTN value converted from a score measured at room temperature by a coffee roast analyzer Agtron E20 CP-II. The Agtron analyzer measures the amount of near-infrared energy at specific wave lengths reflected from the surface of the sample. The score given by Agtron analyzer is converted by the conversion chart “Neuhaus Neotec Colortest vs. Agtron Conversion Chart” given by Modern Process Equipment Chicago, Ill. The “crema” is defined as the head of foam created on the coffee extract with a creamy texture formed of substantially small bubbles. The “initial height” of the coffee crema is measured in a “receptacle of reference” (as referred in the present application) having a defined capacity and dimensions illustrated in FIG. 5. The “stability” of coffee crema is determined by the remaining percentage of the initial height of crema at 180 seconds immediately after dispensing of the coffee extract (or extraction) into the receptacle of reference by the coffee outlet of the machine. The “mean flow rate” is determined by a flow meter positioned after the water heater and before the water injection needle or injection point in the capsule. The “mean water pressure” represents the averaged pressure of water above atmospheric pressure in the water dispensing line of the coffee machine after the water heater and before the injection needle or injection point in the capsule. The water pressure is typically measured by a pressure sensor. The mean diameter D 4,3 represents the volume mean diameter of the coffee particles. This value is determined by laser diffraction method a Camsizer XT instrument commercialized by Retsch company. The method uses dynamic image analysis (ISO 13322-2) and air pressure dispersion. The measuring method is generally taking more than 250 images per second; each with approximately 1.3 MPixel. The resolution is about 1 micron. The width of analysis area is 25 mm (FoV). This equipment uses the principle of digital image processing. The “fines” are all the small coffee particles having a diameter below or equal to 100 microns when measured by the Camsizer XT equipment. The percentage of fines in the coffee powder is expressed in volume. The “extraction yield” is defined as the total weight of total solids in the coffee extract divided by the total weight of roast and ground coffee contained in the capsule. This value is expressed in percentage by weight. Yield   ( % ) = Tc   ( % ) * Weight   extract coffee   weight The “total solids” is defined as the weight of extracted solids contained in the liquid coffee extract divided by the total weight of the liquid coffee extract. This value is expressed in percentage by weight. The “hot water temperature” is determined by the temperature of water inside the heater or of the heating block of the heater in contact with water as determined by a temperature sensor. The “in-cup temperature” is determined by the temperature of the liquid coffee extract at its center immediately after being dispensed in the receptacle from the coffee machine. The temperature is measured at room temperature (23+/−3° C.). The temperature is measured with a calibrated temperature sensor (thermocouple K type supplied by Thermocontrol) in the receptacle of reference.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 relates to a preferred, non-limiting, embodiment of a capsules 1 according to the invention. The capsule is for a single use and designed to deliver a beverage from a beverage producing device or coffee machine. The capsule preferably comprise a cup-shaped body 2 , a circular, annular flange-like rim 3 and an upper wall member of disc form, preferably, a perforable membrane 4 . The cup-shaped body 2 may be shaped as a bowl as illustrated or other forms. Thereby, the membrane 4 and the body 2 enclose an enclosure respectively ingredient compartment 6 . As shown in the figure, the membrane 4 is preferably connected onto an inner annular flange portion of the rim 3 that is for example between 1 to 5 mm. The membrane 4 is connected to the rim 3 of the body by a seal such as a heat or ultrasonic weld line. The rim 3 is not necessarily horizontal as illustrated. It can be slightly bent, upwards or downwards, in order to increase the resistance of the seal to the increasing pressure pushing on the membrane with time, due to degassing of the capsule substance or ingredient with time. The rim 3 of the capsules preferably extends outwardly in a direction essentially perpendicular (as illustrated) or slightly inclined (if bent as aforementioned) relative to the central axis of symmetry I of the body corresponding to the axis of rotation Z of the capsule 1 in the beverage production device (see FIG. 2). Thereby, the axis of symmetry I is aligned with the axis of rotation Z during centrifugation of the capsule in the brewing device. It should be understood that the shown bowl-shaped embodiment of the capsule is just an exemplary embodiment and that the capsule in particular the capsule body 2 according to the invention can take various different shapes. The body 2 has a convex portion 5 of depth d. However, the portion 5 may as well be a truncated or a cylindrical portion or a combination of portions of different shapes such as truncated, cylindrical, spherical, etc. The body 2 of the capsules is preferably rigid or semi-rigid. It can be formed of a food grade plastic, e.g., polypropylene, with a gas barrier layer such as EVOH and the like or aluminium or a laminate of plastic and aluminium, such as aluminium-PP (polypropylene) laminate, wherein preferably PP forms the inner layer of the laminate and aluminium forms the outer layer of the laminate. Additional lacquers or colour layers can be provided. The membrane may also be formed of paper and plastic, paper and aluminium or a combination of paper, aluminium and plastic. Plastic also includes biodegradable plastics such as crystallized PLA or equivalent. The membrane 4 can be made of a thinner material such as a plastic film also including a barrier layer or aluminium or a combination of plastic and aluminium. The membrane 4 is usually of a thickness between 10 and 250 microns, for example. The membrane is perforated for creating the water inlet as will be described later in the description. The membrane also further comprises a perforable peripheral area. Instead of the membrane 4 , the capsules 1 may as well comprise rigid, semi-rigid or flexible engagement lid member which preferably has the form of a disc comprising a central portion having an inlet port for enabling the introduction of a water injection member and a peripheral portion having circumferentially arranged outlet openings. For instance, the outlet openings can be formed by an annular layer of filter paper and/or plastic fabric. The inlet port and outlet openings are thereby premade before insertion of the capsule in the device. They can be covered by a removable gas-tight layer before insertion such as an overwrapping package or a peelable membrane. The capsule 1 is intended for delivery of a long-size coffee, more particularly, liquid coffee extract of 230 ml. The long-size coffee capsule 1 preferably contains an amount of ground coffee between 11 and 14 grams. The filling level of substance in the capsule and /or volume of the capsule is also set to ensure the filling of hot water during a pre-wetting step. Preferably, the capsules in the set according to the invention may contain different blends of roast and ground coffee or coffees from different origins and/or having different roasting and/or grinding characteristics. The capsules of the invention, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 4, more particularly comprises at its flange-like rim 3 , an annular pressure-setting ring 8 protruding, both upwardly and downwardly from the inward flange portion 7 . In particular, the pressure-setting ring, whose function will be explained later on, comprises an upper portion extending, in the axial direction of the capsule, above a plane passing by the flange portion 7 and preferably a lower portion 10 extending below the plane still in axial direction of the capsule. By convention, the reference to plane is here taken along the lower surface of the flange portion 7 . In the context of the invention, the term “axial direction” refers to any direction aligned or parallel to the central axis I of the capsule. The term “transversal direction” refers to any direction perpendicular to the central axis I or inclined of an angle greater than 45 degrees. The term “lower” and “upper” refer here to the relative positions of the means, as illustrated, when the upper wall 4 of the capsule is oriented upwards and the bottom of the body 2 downwards. FIG. 2 shows a view of a coffee machine according to an example of the invention in a closed state thereof. Thereby, the device comprises a rotating capsule holder 20 , a rotary driving means 21 (e.g., rotary motor), and a collector 22 onto which the centrifuged liquid impacts and drains through a beverage outlet 23 . The driving means 21 comprises a rotary motor which is linked to the capsule holder 20 at the bottom side (as illustrated) or top side (not illustrated) through an axle 24 axially connected to the capsule holder. The capsule holder 20 has a circumferential surface that forms a referencing diameter substantially equal to an insertion diameter of the body of the capsule 1 so as to ensure a tight fit of the capsule in the capsule holder 20 without possible radial play. It should be noted that the capsule holder can take various shapes and may also be formed of a simple annular hollow ring. Furthermore, the device comprises water injection means 25 having an injection member 26 being arranged to perforate the membrane 4 of the capsule 1 in a central portion thereof. As described in WO2008/148604, cited here as reference, the injection means 26 are connected to a liquid circuit 28 comprising a water supply 29 such as a water tank, a pump 30 and waterheating apparatus 31 for providing a predefined volume of heated pressurized water to the capsule 1 during the beverage extraction process. The water is fed in the capsule by injection through the injection member 26 having the form of a hollow needle or tube. Additional heating means (not illustrated) are provided to maintain the coffee extract warm when dispensed in the collector 22 . The injection member can be formed of a sharp free end to ensure perforation of the upper wall, if necessary. The device also comprises a series of outlet perforators 27 as described in WO2008/0148604. The outlet perforators are provided at the periphery of an extraction interface 33 which engages against the upper wall of the capsule during closure of the device. Accordingly, outlets are produced in an annular portion of the membrane 4 thereby enabling an extracted (centrifuged) beverage to leave the capsule 1 during the rotational movement thereof. The device further comprises a control unit 40 which controls the different elements of the device, in particular, the pump 30 , heater 31 and rotational speed of the driving means 21 . In particular, the control unit is programmed to adjust operational parameters during extraction including (but not limited) to: water pump flow rate, the water temperature, rotational speed and the different coffee preparation phases cycles, i.e., pre-wetting, extraction, drying. Several programs can be designed specifically to different capsules, for example delivering liquid coffee extract having specific intensity and ‘crema’ characteristics. The capsules can comprise an identification code, such as a barcode, radio-frequency tag, etc., for enabling the identification in the device and for setting of operational parameters automatically. In this case, the device comprises suitable code reading means associated to the control unit. The system of the invention comprises a flow restriction means 18 capable of providing a back-pressure against the centrifuged liquid that leaves the capsule through its outlets (perforated or premade). The valve means 18 is formed by the complementary engagement of the device on the capsule. More particularly (FIG. 4), the device comprises a valve member 34 which is arranged circumferentially relative to the extraction interface 33 and which has a lower annular pressing surface 35 . On the capsule's side, the flow restriction means comprises the pressure-setting ring 8 which is engaged by the annular pressing surface 35 of the valve member 34 of the device. The pressing surface 35 engages onto the upper portion of the pressure-setting ring under a predetermined backpressure. The pressure engagement of the two complementary portions 34 , 8 of the flow restriction means is made resilient by means of a spring-biasing means such as springs 36 placed between the valve member 34 and an annular counter-force element 37 , connected directly or indirectly to, or part of the extraction interface 33 . A spring means 36 (for instance 6 to 10 springs) can be evenly placed at the periphery, between the portion 34 and element 37 , such as helical or blade springs in parallel to distribute and balance the preload onto the rim of the capsule evenly. The valve member 34 and the injection unit 25 are typically movable with respect to the capsule holder 20 (or vice versa) via a closure system (not shown) in order to enable insertion and ejection of the capsule 1 to and from the capsule holder 20 before respectively after the beverage extraction process. Closure system can be a mechanical and/or hydraulic closure mechanism. Moreover, the extraction interface 33 , the valve member 34 , the capsule 1 and the capsule holder 20 are all rotatable about axis Z during the centrifugation process. The valve member 34 is also made moveable independently from the extraction interface 33 to take into account the different possible thicknesses of the capsules without affecting the relative position of the injection portion when engaged against the capsule. For this, portion 34 can be slidably mounted about extraction interface 33 . A joint 44 , such as an O-ring, can be provided between the two parts 33 , 34 to ensure liquid-tightness of the flow restriction means. On the capsule's holder side, the pressure-setting ring 8 can be firmly supported by a lowered portion or recess 38 of the supporting edge of the capsule holder 20 . The lowered portion or recess 38 is lowered relative to a flange-supporting portion 39 of the edge of the capsule holder which holds the flange portion 7 of the rim. The extraction of the beverage out of the capsule 1 is obtained by driving the extraction interface 33 of the injection unit 25 , the flow restriction means 18 , the capsule holder 20 and capsule together, in rotation about axis Z, at a high rotational speed, e.g., between 3500 and 5000 rpm, that can be constant or variable. The rotational speed must be sufficient during extraction to create a centrifugal pressure of liquid in the capsule enabling opening of the flow restriction means as described. Hot water which is centrally injected into the capsule 1 tends to be guided along the inner surface of the side wall of the body 2 , up to the inner side of the membrane 4 , and then through the perforated outlet openings created in the membrane 4 by the perforating members 24 then through the valve means 18 between surface 35 and top of the ring 8 . Liquid can be filtered by the interstice created between the perforators 27 and the membrane 4 to ensure that most coffee particles are kept in the capsule. Due to the centrifugation of the liquid in the capsule 1 , the liquid and the roast and ground coffee powder provided within the capsule are made to interact in order to form a coffee liquid extract. FIG. 4 illustrates the system when beverage is centrifuged out of the capsule and the flow restriction means is opened sufficiently so that liquid passes between the pressure-setting ring 8 and the flow restriction member 34 . Centrifuged beverage is given a sufficient pressure upstream the valve means to open it and create an annular restriction opening 42 for liquid flow to be projected towards the impact wall 46 of the collector at high velocity. Opening of the valve means is again obtained by the liquid forcing the valve member 34 to further urge against the springs 36 . It should be noted that a small liquid leakage between the flow restriction means 18 and the ring 8 can be required that helps to vent the gas or air contained in the capsule during the filling of the capsule with water at the beginning of the beverage preparation process (pre-wetting or filling step). After filling of the capsule with hot water and during the extraction phase, water continues to be fed in the capsule by the water pump at a controlled water flow rate or flow rates. Preferably, the rotational speed is controlled to match a preferred water flow rate of reference. Water flow rate can be measured by a flow meter placed in the fluid circuit downstream of the water pump and controlled by control unit 40 . The rotational speed fluctuates during extraction phase to match a flow rate of reference as preset in the control unit. The extraction step can be divided in different successive phases with different flow rate targets or (increasing or decreasing) profiles of flow rates. At the end of the extraction phase, the water pump may be stopped while centrifugation is maintained to empty the capsule from residual liquid (“drying”). More information concerning the control of the coffee production in the machine is described in co-pending patent application PCT/EP13/076448. EXAMPLES Example 1 The following analysis aimed at comparing crema quantity and stability obtained by extracting using centrifugal extraction liquid coffee extracts with different roasting degrees and particle sizes. Product Colombian (100% pure Arabica) coffee has been roasted in a Neuhaus Neotec roaster RFB-S by batches of 400 g at different roasting degrees. The roasting degrees were the following: 100 CTN for “Light roast” (representative of roasting degree range from 110 to 91); 80 CTN for “Medium roast” (representative of roasting degree range from 90 to 71); 60 CTN for “Dark roast” (representative of roasting degree range from 70 to 50). The weight of the roast and ground coffee in the capsule was 13 g. The degasing time was 10 min with O 2 content lower than 2% volume. The characteristics of particle size, measured on the Camsizer XT were the following: Grinding 1 Grinding 2 Grinding 3 Particle size % Particle size % Particle size % (μm) fines (μm) fines (μm) fines Dark 567 5 510 12 504 11 roast 545 6 505 9 407 21 269 21 289 16 232 30 Medium 548 8 486 12 388 26 roast 512 10 469 14 403 18 302 13 267 21 261 22 Light 545 8 488 13 438 15 roast 544 9 479 13 402 18 303 14 284 18 224 29 To facilitate coding of sample, the following code table has been used: Grinding 1 Grinding 2 Grinding 3 Particle % Particle % Particle % size fines size fines size fines Dark D1 D2 D3 roast D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9 Medium M1 M2 M3 roast M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 Light L1 L2 L3 roast L4 L5 L6 L7 L8 L9 To summarize, looking to the average values, granulometry values for each roasting degree were: Range low Range up Dark Particle size (μm) 385 565 roast % fines 5 25 Medium Particle size (μm) 220 311 roast % fines 12 31 Light Particle size (μm) 401 552 roast % fines 6 21 The coffee yield and total solids of the coffee extracts obtained from the dark coffee roast capsules were determined as follows: Dark roast Yield (%) Total Solids (Tc) D1 23.1 1.28 D2 23.2 1.28 D3 24.7 1.36 D4 23.0 1.28 D5 23.2 1.28 D6 26.2 1.45 D7 26.2 1.45 D8 27.9 1.53 D9 27.9 1.53 The coffee yield can vary within a relatively large range. The yield can also be increased with some Robusta coffee in the blend. Receptacle and Characteristics of Coffee Crema As illustrated in FIG. 5, the “receptacle of reference” intended for characterizing the crema of the liquid coffee extract in the present invention was a transparent quartz-type glass having a capacity of 370 ml. The glass had a circular internal bottom flat surface of diameter D 1 equal to 51.7 mm, a top circular larger opening of diameter D 2 equal to 83.7 mm, an internal axial height H of 124 mm and a wall thickness T of 2.3 mm. The side wall was rotationally symmetrical and sloped by widening continuously and essentially rectilinearly from the bottom towards the top opening. The height of crema was measured directly on the glass wall with a ruler. In the results, the values are expressed in centimeter. The stability was calculated at 180 seconds just after dispensing of the coffee extract in the receptacle of reference. Capsule, Machine and Method The capsule was a capsule as described in relation to FIG. 1. The machine was a centrifugal coffee machine Nespresso Vertuo™, which centrifugal extraction principle is described in relation with FIGS. 2 to 4. 230-ml liquid coffee extracts were produced. The extraction was repeated five times for each sample. Crema Results Influence of Roasting Degree on Crema Volume The results are provided in FIG. 7. The X- axis refers to the CTN roasting degree for three values: 60, 80 and 100. The Y-axis refers to the initial height of crema. The roasting degree impact on the crema quantity is significant. The more coffee is roasted, the larger the volume (height) of crema. Influence of Roasting Degree on Crema Stability The results are provided in FIG. 8. The X-axis refers to the CTN roasting degree. The Y-axis refers to the stability in percentage. The roasting degree impact on crema stability is significant. The more the coffee is roasted, the more stable is the crema after extraction. Influence of Particle Size and Fines Content on Crema for Dark Roast Coffee Capsules The results on crema height for the dark roasted coffee capsules are provided in FIG. 9. The X-axis refers to the Dark samples D 1 -D 9 . The Y-axis refers to the initial height of crema. The results on crema stability are provided in FIG. 10. The X-axis refers to the Dark roast samples D 1 -D 9 . The Y-axis refers to the stability of the crema. The D 7 , D 8 and D 9 samples provided the larger initial height of coffee crema with more than 30 mm. The stability of the samples D 2 -D 9 was not significantly different. Sample D 1 had a lower stability. Influence of Particle Size and Fines Content on Crema for Medium Roast Coffee Capsules The results on crema height for the medium roasted coffee capsules are provided in FIG. 11. The results on crema stability are provided in FIG. 12. The crema stability is not significantly different for samples M 2 -M 9 . The height of crema is globally lower than for dark roasted capsules but acceptable. The stability is slightly lower. Influence of Particle Size and Fines Content on Crema for Light Roast Coffee Capsules The results on crema volume for the light roasted coffee capsules are provided in FIG. 13. The results on crema stability for the light roast are provided in FIG. 14. The height of crema is significantly lower than for dark roast coffee capsules. The stability of crema is significantly lower except for L 7 , L 8 and L 9 . Globally, the results show that dark roast coffee capsules provides crema volume in a wide range of particle size and fines contents. Example 2 Influence of Coffee Weight on Crema Quality The type of capsules and machine were the same as for example 1. For this example, half-decaffeinated coffee was used. The water temperature during coffee extraction was set at 83° C. The in-cup coffee temperature was 75° C. The flow rate for capsule Y was 168 ml/min and the extraction pressure was 910 mbar. 230-ml Coffee Weight D 4, 3 Fine Yield Tc coffee extract (grams) (microns) (% vol.) (% wt.) (% wt.)

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Chlorogenic acids, caffeic acids, ferulic acids etc., which are contained in foods such as coffee, have been reported to show an excellent hypotensive action (JP-A 2006-204192, JP-B 4-29326, JP-A 3-127950). However, coffee beverages containing merely chlorogenic acids in large quantity are also reported to have no plainly recognizable hypotensive action and tend to increase the blood pressure to the contrary (Eur. J. Clin. Nutr., 53 (11), 831 (1999)). Hydrogen peroxide derived from hydroxyhydroquinone contained in coffee beverages has been found to inhibit the hypotensive action of chlorogenic acids (JP-A 2006-204192). On one hand, coffee contains hydrogen peroxide which naturally emerges upon roasting (Eur. J. Clin.

Coffee is a highly palatable beverage, and its influences on the health of human body have attracted attention in recent years. The present inventors have paid attention to a hypotensive action as one influence and reported that hydroxyhydroquinone contained in a coffee beverage composition is reduced such that the weight ratio of hydroxyhydroquinone/chlorogenic acids in the coffee beverage composition is reduced to 10/10000 or less at which the hypotensive action of coffee was recognized, and as a specific method, a method of treating a coffee extract with activated carbon has been adopted (WO-A 05/72533). As methods of treating coffee beans, there are proposed methods such as a decaffeinating method of contacting raw coffee beans with an organic solvent, water or a supercritical fluid, a method of wash treatment, with water, of matter that has adhered to the surfaces of raw coffee beans, and a method of removing a stimulating substance by high-pressure steaming of raw coffee beans. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention (I) provides refined roasted coffee beans having a Hunter L value of 10 to 30 and a hydroxyhydroquinone content of not higher than 30 mg/kg. The present invention also provides a process for producing refined roasted coffee beans having a hydroxyhydroquinone content of not higher than 30 mg/kg, which includes contacting an aqueous solvent with raw material roasted coffee beans. The present invention (II) is based on the fining described above, and provides a process for producing refined roasted coffee beans, which includes contacting refined roasted coffee beans having a Hunter L value of 12 to 35, with water containing an extract derived from roasted coffee beans having a Hunter L value of 40 or more or water containing an extract derived from raw coffee beans (hereinafter referred to as coffee bean-derived extract-containing water). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Any of the conventional methods of treating coffee beans relate to methods of treating raw coffee beans, and methods for removing hydroxyhydroquinone from roasted coffee beans have not been reported as far as known to the applicant. The invention (I) provides refined roasted coffee beans with a reduced content of hydroxyhydroquinone. To enable production of coffee extracts having an excellent hypotensive action, the present inventors extensively studied a method of removing hydroxyhydroquinone as a hydrogen peroxide source from raw material roasted coffee beans, and as a result, they found that refined roasted coffee beans having a hydroxyhydroquinone content reduced to not higher than 30 mg/kg can be produced. The invention (II) provides a process for producing refined roasted coffee beans containing chlorogenic acids at high concentration, having a low mass ratio of hydroxyhydroquinone to chlorogenic acids, and being excellent in flavor. The present inventors examined a method capable of removing hydroxyhydroquinone at the stage of coffee beans, and as a result, they found that the treatment of raw material roasted coffee beans with an aqueous solution containing chlorogenic acids but scarcely containing hydroxyhydroquinone is effective in removing hydroxyhydroquinone effectively while allowing chlorogenic acids to remain in coffee beans that were roasted to such a degree as to attain fragrance. According to the invention (I) directed to the refined roasted coffee beans having a hydroxyhydroquinone content of not higher than 30 mg/kg and to the process for producing the same, it is possible to produce coffee extracts having an excellent hypotensive action. According to the invention (II), it is possible to obtain refined roasted coffee beans maintaining fragrance, having a high content of chlorogenic acids, and having effectively reduced hydroxyhydroquinone. Further, there is provided a process for producing refined roasted coffee beans having a high concentration of chlorogenic acids, having a low mass ratio of hydroxyhydroquinone to chlorogenic acids, and being excellent in flavor. First, the refined roasted coffee beans obtained in the present invention will be described. The kinds of coffee beans in the present invention include, but are not limited to, Brazil, Columbia, Tanzania, Mocha, Kilimanjaro, Mandheling, and Blue Mountain. The species of coffee beans include an Arabica species, and a Robusta species. As coffee beans, either one kind or a blend of two or more kinds may be used. Hereinafter, the invention (I) will be described in detail. The Hunter L value as determined with a color-difference meter from the degree of roasting of the product of the present invention is 10 to 30. From the viewpoint of an excellent flavor of an extract from the refined roasted coffee beans, the Hunter L value is preferably 10 to 25, more preferably 15 to 25. When the Hunter L value is 10 or more, the refined roasted coffee beans have a less burning smell, and when the L value is 30 or less, the beans become excellent in flavor. Two or more kinds of refined roasted coffee beans different in the degree of roasting with Hunter L values of 10 to 60 may be mixed and regulated to have a Hunter L value of 10 to 30. A method of measuring the degree of roasting is carried out as follows. 50% of roasted coffee beans are ground to a grain size of 0.8 to 1.2 mm such that the amount of beans having a grain size of 0.5 mm or less and the amount of beans having a grain size of 2 mm or more are regulated to be 5% or less respectively, and chaff is removed as necessary. The ground beans are introduced into a cell, sufficiently tapped and then measured with a spectroscopic colorimeter. As the spectroscopic colorimeter, SE-2000 manufactured by Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd. or the like can be used. The amount of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans is preferably 0.1 to 6% by mass (hereinafter referred to merely as %), more preferably 0.1 to 5%. The amount of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans is more preferably 0.1 to 4.5%, even more preferably 0.2 to 4.2% and even more preferably 0.2 to 4%. The content of hydroxyhydroquinone in the refined roasted coffee beans is not higher than 30 mg/kg.

The content of hydroxyhydroquinone relative to the amount of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans is preferably lower than 0.1%, more preferably 0.0001 to 0.06%, even more preferably 0.0001 to 0.03%. When the content of hydroxyhydroquinone relative to the amount of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans is lower than 0.1%, the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the body is inhibited and simultaneously the physiological effects of chlorogenic acids reduced by hydroxyhydroquinone, for example, hypertension-alleviating effects, can be easily exhibited. The content of chlorogenic acids relative to the content of soluble solids in the refined roasted coffee beans is preferably 0.5 to 30%. The content of chlorogenic acids relative to the content of soluble solids in the refined roasted coffee beans is preferably 0.5 to 25%, more preferably 0.5 to 17%, even more preferably 1 to 15%, and even more preferably 1 to 13%. When the content of chlorogenic acids relative to the content of soluble solids in the refined roasted coffee beans is in this range, the physiological effects of chlorogenic acids in coffee beverages can be easily exhibited and simultaneously an excellent coffee flavor can be easily obtained. As the chlorogenic acids, three chlorogenic acids, that is, monocaffeoylquinic acid, feruloylquinic acid and dicaffeoylquinic acid are known, and the content of chlorogenic acids herein is indicated as the total amount of these acids. Specifically, monocaffeoylquinic acid includes one or more members selected from 3-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, and 5-caffeoylquinic acid.

Dicaffeoylquinic acid includes one or more members selected from 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acids, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acids, and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acids. The composition of the refined roasted coffee beans in the present invention is determined from the composition of a liquid extracted from the refined roasted coffee beans. The extraction conditions used are those described in the Examples. The content of the chlorogenic acids is measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a UV-VIS detector. The measurement conditions used are those described in the Examples. The content of the hydroxyhydroquinone is measured by HPLC with an electrochemical detector.

As a sugar refractometer, ATAGO RX-5000α-Bev (manufactured by ATAGO CO., LTD.) or the like can be used. The amounts of chlorogenic acids, hydroxy quinone and soluble solids as determined by the measurement described above are calculated respectively as the contents in the coffee beans by the following equations: Amount (% relative to coffee beans) of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans=(concentration (mg/kg) of chlorogenic acids in the extraction solvent×mass (kg) of the extraction solvent/mass (kg) of the refined roasted coffee beans)/10000(%)  (1) Amount (mg/kg) of hydroxyhydroquinone in the refined roasted coffee beans=(concentration (mg/kg) of hydroxyhydroquinone in the extraction solvent×mass (kg) of the extraction solvent/mass (kg) of the refined roasted coffee beans)  (2) Amount (% relative to coffee beans) of soluble solids in the refined roasted coffee beans=content (%) of soluble solids in the extraction solvent×mass (kg) of the extraction solvent/mass (kg) of the refined roasted coffee beans  (3) Now, the process for producing refined roasted coffee beans will be described.

A method of measuring the degree of roasting is carried out as follows. 50% of roasted coffee beans are ground to a grain size of 0.8 to 1.2 mm such that the amount of beans having a grain size of 0.5 mm or less and the amount of beans having a grain size of 2 mm or more are regulated to be 5% or less respectively, and chaff is removed as necessary. The ground beans are introduced into a cell, sufficiently tapped and then measured with a spectroscopic colorimeter. As the spectroscopic colorimeter, SE-2000 manufactured by Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd. or the like can be used. The amount of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans is preferably 0.1 to 6% by mass (hereinafter referred to merely as %). The amount of chlorogenic acids is preferably 0.1 to 5%, more preferably 0.1 to 4.5%, even more preferably 0.2 to 4.2%, even more preferably 0.2 to 4% and even more preferably 2 to 4%. The content of hydroxyhydroquinone in the refined roasted coffee beans is not higher than 30 mg/kg. The content of hydroxyhydroquinone is preferably not higher than 20 mg/kg, more preferably not higher than 10 mg/kg, even more preferably not higher than 5 mg/kg and even more preferably not higher than 1 mg/kg. The content of hydroxyhydroquinone relative to the amount of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans is preferably lower than 0.1%, more preferably 0.0001 to 0.06%, even more preferably 0.0001 to 0.03%. When the content of hydroxyhydroquinone relative to the amount of chlorogenic acids in the refined roasted coffee beans is lower than 0.1%, the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the body is inhibited and simultaneously the physiological effects of chlorogenic acids reduced by hydroxyhydroquinone, for example, hypertension-alleviating effects, can be easily exhibited. The content of chlorogenic acids relative to the content of soluble solids in the refined roasted coffee beans is preferably 0.5 to 30%. The content of chlorogenic acids relative to the content of soluble solids in the roasted coffee beans is preferably 0.5 to 25%, more preferably 0.5 to 17%, even more preferably 1 to 15% and even more preferably 1 to 13%. When the content of chlorogenic acids relative to the content of soluble solids in the refined roasted coffee beans, the physiological effects of chlorogenic acids in coffee beverages can be easily exhibited and simultaneously an excellent coffee flavor can be easily obtained. The chlorogenic acids are the same as described above in the invention (I). Each composition in the refined roasted coffee beans in the present invention is determined from a liquid composition extracted from the refined roasted coffee beans. The extraction conditions used are those described in the Examples. The content of chlorogenic acids and the content of hydroxyhydroquinone can be measured in the same manner as described above in the invention (I). The amounts of chlorogenic acids, hydroxy quinone, and soluble solids as determined by the measurement described above are calculated as the contents in the coffee beans by the equations (1), (2) and (3) above respectively. Now, the process for producing the refined roasted coffee beans from which hydroxyhydroquinone was removed according to the present invention is described. First, coffee beans are roasted to yield raw material roasted coffee beans. The method of roasting coffee beans can be carried out in the same manner as described above in the invention (I). The raw material roasted coffee beans are also the same as described above in the invention (I). As the degrees of roasting of raw material roasted coffee beans, there are light, cinnamon, medium, high, city, full-city, French, and Italian, among which light, cinnamon, medium, high, and city are preferable because the coffee beans with these degrees contain a large amount of chlorogenic acids and provide easily drunk beverages. The raw material roasted coffee beans are contacted with water containing an extract derived from roasted coffee beans having a Hunter L value of 40 or more or water containing an extract derived from raw coffee beans (hereinafter referred to as coffee bean-derived extract-containing water). Use of water containing an extract derived from raw coffee beans is preferable in selectively removing hydroxyhydroquinone without eluting chlorogenic acids from the roasted coffee beans, because this treatment water is free of hydroxyhydroquinone and rich in chlorogenic acids. On the other hand, use of water containing an extract derived from roasted coffee beans having a Hunter L value of 40 or more is advantageous in that fragrant flavors of coffee can be effectively maintained. Further, use of water containing an extract derived from roasted coffee beans having a Hunter L value of 40 or more is advantageous from the viewpoint of ease in the process and of conferring coffee flavors, because previous removal of hydroxyhydroquinone from roasted coffee beans having a Hunter L value of 40 or more is not necessary due to an extremely low content of hydroxyhydroquinone in the roasted coffee beans. The L value of low roasted coffee beans is preferably 40 to 55, more preferably 42 to 52. To efficiently remove hydroxyhydroquinone from roasted beans, the content of hydroxyhydroquinone in coffee bean-derived extract-containing water is preferably not higher than 6 mg/kg, more preferably not higher than 3 mg/kg, even more preferably not higher than 1 mg/kg, even more preferably not higher than 0.5 mg/kg and even more preferably not higher than 0.1 mg/kg. The ratio by mass of hydroxyhydroquinone to chlorogenic acids in the aqueous solvent is preferably 1% or less, more preferably 0.0001 to 0.5%, even more preferably 0.0001 to 0.1% and even more preferably 0.0001 to 0.06%. The concentration of chlorogenic acids in the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water is preferably 0.01 to 5%, more preferably 0.05 to 3%, even more preferably 0.1 to 2%, from the viewpoint of effectively preventing the elution of chlorogenic acids from the roasted beans and simultaneously eluting hydroxyhydroquinone effectively therefrom. The concentration of water-soluble solids in the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water, when expressed in Brix, is preferably 2 to 15. When the concentration of water-soluble solids is in this range, the process of removing hydroxyhydroquinone can smoothly proceed. The concentration is more preferably 2 to 13, more preferably 3 to 12.

The water-soluble organic matter is preferably an organic matter which is dissolved in an amount of 25 g or more in 100 g of water at 20° C. Specifically, the water-soluble organic matter can be exemplified by sugars, polyhydric alcohols, and water-soluble polymers. These water-soluble organic matters maybe used alone or as a mixture of two or more thereof. The sugars include glucose, galactose, fructose, mannose, mannitol, saccharose, maltose, lactose, and oligosaccharides. The polyhydric alcohols include glycerin, sorbitol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol. The water-soluble polymers include sodium polyacrylate, polyethyleneimine, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene oxide, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. Preferable among these water-soluble organic matters are polyhydric alcohols, among which glycerin or sorbitol is particularly preferable. The water-soluble organic solvent and/or the water-soluble organic matter can be used at a concentration of 0.01 to 5% in water. The method of contacting raw material roasted coffee beans with coffee bean-derived extract-containing water includes a stirring batch treatment method wherein the raw material roasted coffee beans are treated by mixing them with coffee bean-derived extract-containing water and a column treatment method wherein the raw material roasted coffee beans are packed in a column and coffee bean-derived extract-containing water is passed through the column. From the viewpoint of extraction efficiency, the column treatment method is preferable. In the stirring batch treatment method, the raw material roasted coffee beans are stirred preferably in a floating state in an aqueous solvent. In the column treatment method, the column may have a structure in which the raw material roasted coffee beans are substantially not leaked into an aqueous solvent, and can be exemplified by, for example, a column having a mesh structure in a liquid inlet and outlet respectively. The raw material roasted coffee beans used herein may be either a ground or non-ground product. From the viewpoint of allowing flavors to remain in the roasted coffee beans, non-ground roasted coffee beans are preferably used. When the ground product is used, the degree of grinding includes very fine grinding (0.250 to 0.500 mm), fine grinding (0.300 to 0.650 mm), medium-fine grinding (0.530 to 1.000 mm), medium grinding (0.650 to 1.500 mm), medium-coarse grinding, coarse grinding (0.850 to 2.100 mm) and very coarse grinding (1.000 to 2.500 mm), or a cut product with an average particle size of about 3 mm, 5 mm or 10 mm can be mentioned.

Contacting of the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water with raw material roasted coffee beans can be conducted for 1 second to 100 hours. In the stirring batch treatment method, the contact time is preferably 1 to 50 hours. In the column passage method, the retention time of the water in the column is 1 minute to 10 hours, preferably 5 minutes to 1 hour. The coffee bean-derived extract-containing water used in treatment of the raw material roasted coffee beans can be used repeatedly, but the water is reused preferably after hydroxyhydroquinone that has increased in each treatment is reduced. Before treatment, hydroxyhydroquinone in the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water may be previously reduced. The method of reducing hydroxyhydroquinone is preferably a method of contacting, with a porous adsorbent, the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water that was used in treatment. Contacting of the raw material roasted coffee beans with the aqueous solvent preferably includes a step of contacting the aqueous solvent with a porous adsorbent. By contacting the aqueous solvent with a porous adsorbent, hydroxyhydroquinone which has transferred from raw material roasted coffee beans to the aqueous solvent can be removed by absorption into the porous adsorbent, and the hydroxyhydroquinone can thereby be efficiently removed from the raw material roasted coffee beans. The relationship between contacting of the raw material roasted coffee beans with the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water and contacting of the aqueous solvent with the porous adsorbent includes, for example, the following relationships: that is, (i) a step of previously contacting the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water with the porous adsorbent, and then contacting the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water which has been contacted with the porous adsorbent, with the raw material roasted coffee beans; (ii) a step of allowing the raw material roasted coffee beans, the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water and the porous adsorbent to be simultaneously coexistent, thereby adsorbing, onto the porous adsorbent, hydroxyhydroquinone extracted from the raw material roasted coffee beans; and (iii) a step of contacting the raw material roasted coffee beans with the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water, then contacting the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water with the porous adsorbent, and again contacting, with the raw material roasted coffee beans, the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water obtained by contacting with the porous adsorbent. In any of the methods, contacting of the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water with the porous adsorbent may be carried out by a method of dispersing the porous adsorbent in the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water and then separating the porous adsorbent (stirring batch method) or by a method of passing the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water through a column or the like charged with the porous adsorbent (column passage method). The method (ii) may be carried out by a method wherein a tank in which the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water is contacted with the porous adsorbent, and a tank or column in which the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water is contacted with the porous adsorbent, are separately prepared and then connected to each other, thereby circulating the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water. The method of contacting the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water with the porous adsorbent includes a stirring batch method wherein the porous adsorbent, together with the roasted coffee beans, is introduced into the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water and a method wherein the raw material roasted coffee beans are contacted with the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water which is being circulated through an adsorption column packed with the porous adsorbent. The method of contacting the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water with the porous adsorbent is preferably a method wherein the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water is circulated both through an adsorption column packed with the porous adsorbent and through a column to which the raw material roasted coffee beans were introduced. As types of the porous adsorbent, it is possible to employ carbonaceous adsorbents, silica-alumina adsorbents, polymer adsorbents and chitosan resin described in Adsorption Technology Handbook “Purosesu•Zairyo•Sekkei (Process, Material and Design)” published on Jan. 11, 1999 by NTS Inc. and supervised by You Takeuchi. From the viewpoint of allowing the coffee flavor to in the roasted coffee beans, carbonaceous adsorbents are preferable. The carbonaceous adsorbents that can be used herein include powdered activated carbon, granular activated carbon, super activated carbon, activated carbon activated with KOH, phenolic activated carbon, activated carbon fibers, and carbon nanotubes. From the viewpoint of selective adsorption of hydroxyhydroquinone, powdered activated carbon, granular activated carbon, and activated carbon fibers are preferable. Materials from which powdered activated carbon and granular activated carbon are derived include sawdust, wood, coal, and palm shell, and palm shell-derived palm shell activated carbon is preferred. Palm shell activated carbon, activated with a gas such as steam, is more preferred. As commercial products of such steam-activated activated carbon, SHIRASAGI WH2c (Japan EnviroChemicals, Ltd.), TAIKO CW (Futamura Chemical Industries Co., Ltd.), KURARAY COAL GL (Kuraray Chemical Co., Ltd.) and the like can be used. The particle size of the porous adsorbent is not particularly limited, but from the viewpoint of improving the rate of adsorption of hydroxyhydroquinone and of improving the ability of the porous adsorbent to be separated from the aqueous solvent, the average particle size is preferably 10 μm or more to 2 mm or less, more preferably 50 μm or more to 1 mm or less, even more preferably 50 μm or more to 0.5 mm or less and even more preferably 150 μm or more to 400 μm or less.

The form of the porous adsorbent is not particularly limited, and the porous adsorbent may be not only in a usual powdery or granular form but also in the form of a product containing the adsorbent kneaded in fibers, a product having plural kinds of porous adsorbents molded therein or a product having the porous adsorbent molded with cellulose, nonwoven fabrics and a binder. The porous adsorbent wherein the volume of pores having 0.7 nanometer (nm) or less is 10% or more based on the total volume of pores in the porous adsorbent can be preferably used in selectively removing hydroxyhydroquinone from the treatment solution after treatment as well as in preventing reduction in the concentration of chlorogenic acids. The porous adsorbent is more preferably one wherein the volume of pores having 0.7 nanometer (nm) or less is 30% or more, particularly 50% or more, especially 70% or more, based on the total volume of pores in the porous adsorbent. The porous adsorbent wherein the volume of pores having 0.7 nanometer (nm) or less is less than 10% based on the total volume of pores in the porous adsorbent tends to be poor in selectivity in removal of hydroxyhydroquinone. The radius and volume of pores in the porous adsorbent, when in the range of pore radii of 1 nanometer (nm) or less, are values determined by an MP method, or when in the range of pore radii of greater than 1 nanometer (nm), are values determined by a KJH method. Whether the volume of pores having 0.7 nanometer (nm) or less is 10% based on the total volume of pores in the porous adsorbent can be judged from a pore distribution curve obtained by the MP method and KJH method. The MP method is a pore measurement method described in a document (Colloid and Interface Science, 26, 46 (1968)), and the KJH method is a pore measurement method described in a document (J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 73, 373 (1951)). After have been separated from the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water and the porous adsorbent, the product of the present invention that is the refined roasted coffee beans, from which hydroxyhydroquinone has been separated, may be subjected directly as a coffee product to extraction with water such as hot water or espresso extraction to produce a coffee extract. From the viewpoint of storage, the refined roasted coffee beans are subjected to drying etc. to remove the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water from the refined roasted coffee beans. The content of the coffee bean-derived extract-containing water in the refined roasted coffee beans after drying is 0.1 to 50%, preferably 1 to 20%, more preferably 1 to 10%. As the drying method, it is possible to employ drying with hot air at 50 to 250° C., dying under reduced pressure at 50 to 150° C., or freeze drying. The refined roasted coffee beans produced in this manner can be used to produce a coffee extract which can be blended, charged and sterilized in coffee, in coffee beverages, and in beverages packed in PET bottles, cans, cups and paper containers. Alternatively, the coffee extract can be dried to form soluble coffee. The coffee extract of the refined roasted coffee beans may be blended with an extract of raw coffee beans. The method of extraction from the refined roasted coffee beans is not limited. For example, there is a method of extraction from the refined roasted coffee beans or a ground product thereof with an extraction solvent for 10 seconds to 120 minutes. The extraction method includes a batch extraction method, a semi-batch extraction method and a continuous extraction method. The extraction time in the batch extraction method or semi-batch extraction method is preferably 10 seconds to 120 minutes, more preferably 30 seconds to 30 minutes, from the viewpoint of flavor. The amount of the extraction solvent is preferably 0.5 to 50 parts relative to 1 part of the refined roasted coffee beans.

No. 12/247,231, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,495,950, entitled “Method And Apparatus For Brewing Coffee Via Universal Coffee Brewing Chart Generation”, filed Oct. 8, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The disclosures herein relate generally to the preparation of beverages for consumption, and more particularly, to brewing beverages such as coffee. BACKGROUND Quality standards in the specialty coffee industry established during the 1950's and 1960's that coffee extraction of approximately 20% (usually a range of ˜18-22%) will achieve the best quality brewed coffee, using various brew methods. Over the ensuing years these established standards have been generally referred to as the gold-cup standard, and have been accepted internationally by many institutions, educational establishments, and standards committees. The precise extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration) may be varied for particular coffees, to achieve finely tuned recipes for particular coffee cultivars, climates and growing regions, also known as terroir, and other characteristics. Extraction (solubles yield) refers to the percentage of the dry coffee by weight that is removed by dissolving in water during the brewing process. Up to 30% of the available soluble solids in ground coffee can be extracted, with most of the remaining 70% being cellulose, and not soluble in water. However, generally speaking, extracting more than 22% will begin to sharply increase those components in coffee that contribute to the bitter taste defects associated with over-extraction. Extracting less than 18% is generally associated with weak, under-developed taste defects. The finished brew is a balance between extraction (solubles yield) and strength (solubles concentration). Over-extracting results in the extraction of many of the bitter components of the remaining solids. These contribute significantly to those taste defects known as bitter, strong-bitter and weak bitter. Under-extracting causes a taste defect that is under-developed and can be weakly or strongly under-developed. As coffee dissolves, the bulk of the solids including the sweeter components dissolve during the first 30-50% of the brewing cycle, and the more bitter elements start to dissolve in the latter half of the brewing cycle. The highest quality coffee will have rich aroma, fullness of body, delicacy of flavor as well as clarity and unique character—all optimally balanced. Achieving these attributes requires a significant degree of precision during the coffee brewing process. Strength (solubles concentration) refers to the measured amount of solids extracted into the final coffee solution. Strength may be expressed as the percentage total dissolved solids (% TDS). For example, for 100 grams of a coffee measuring 1.3% TDS, there are 98.7 grams of water, and 1.3 grams of dissolved coffee solids in solution. Refractive index measurements have been used for process control in the food industry since the 1940s. Typical measurements are usually for sugars in fruits such as melons, for orange and other juices, for sugar content in grapes for the wine industry, and many other examples. SUMMARY Accordingly, in one embodiment a method of brewing coffee is disclosed. The method includes receiving, by an information handling system (IHS) that includes a monitor, first input information that specifies a coffee design mode for brewing a brewed coffee beverage. The method also include receiving, by the IHS, second input information. The method further includes calculating, by the IHS, a brew formula line that exhibits a unitless brew formula ratio of water weight to coffee weight in response to the second input information, the brew formula line being calculated as ordered pairs that specify extraction yield and TDS on a universal brewing control chart. The method still further includes displaying, by the monitor of the IHS, the brew formula line on the universal brewing control chart, the brew formula line being dependent on the brew formula ratio. The disclosed method also includes brewing, in a brewer, coffee and water as specified by the brew formula ratio to provide the brewed coffee beverage. In one embodiment, the method may further include adjusting a brew formula associated with the brew formula line to normalize the target coffee extraction of the calculating step to account for CO2 content of the coffee employed in the brewing step. The method may also include adjusting a brew formula associated with the brew formula line to normalize the target coffee extraction of the calculating step to account for moisture content of the coffee employed in the brewing step. In one embodiment, the method may further include adjusting a brew formula associated with the brew formula line to normalize the target coffee extraction of the calculating step to account for drip brewing being employed in the brewing step. The method may also include adjusting a brew formula associated with the brew formula line to normalize the target coffee extraction of the calculating step to account for immersion brewing being employed in the brewing step.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a prior original brewing chart that shows soluble solids vs. brew formula as a function of extraction percent, namely 5-40 percent as seen in the upper left of the chart (CBC Publication No. 27, 1969, p 12). The y axis represents soluble solids concentration (strength) in percent while the x axis represents the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. Hyperbolic curves representing soluble solids yield extraction in percent from 5-40% are illustrated. Of particular interest in this series of hyperbolas are region of interest 105 and the smaller region of interest 110 . Region of interest 105 relates to a study carried out by the Brewing Committee of the National Coffee Association, which judged brews prepared within this region for objective acceptability. The Midwest Research Institute carried out a more recent independent study from which it was concluded that the most acceptable coffee would result from preparation within the more refined region of interest 110 , for soluble solids concentration (strength) from 1.15 to 1.35 percent and soluble solids yield extraction between 18 and 22 percent (Niven, W. W., Jr. and Shaw, B. C., Critical Conditions for Quality Coffee Brewing, Coffee and Tea Industries 80, No. 4, 44, April, 1957. Tea and Coffee Trade Journal, 112, No. 4, 28-April, 1957. Coffee Brewing Center, Nos. 19 and 27, 1969. The brewing chart of FIG. 1 signifies that a very small area of the curves thereof (i.e. region of interest 105 or region of interest 110 ) should be targeted for proper coffee extraction relative to the wide range of extraction possible. FIG. 2 is an enlargement of a portion of the brewing chart of FIG. 1 focusing on regions of interest 105 and 110 . FIG. 3 is a conventional representation of the data for FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 including solubles concentration (strength) vs. solubles yield (extraction) with brew formula as the parameter. More particularly, the y axis of FIG. 3 represents extracted solids in solution (percent TDS or total dissolved solids) while the x axis represents extraction in ounces per pound (solubles yield). The plotted curves are nearly straight lines (curves) that correspond to the brew formula in gallons of water per pound of coffee. The plot of FIG. 3 identifies a substantially centered rectangular region of interest 305 as representing the ideal coffee brew. This region of interest 305 is the same as originally published by the CBC and as identified as developed by the Midwest Research Institute, region 110 , previously in FIGS. 1 and 2. These plots assume the specific gravity of water at ambient temperature which may in fact be substantially different from the specific gravity of water at the actual brewing temperature. This assumption may have a negative impact on the brewing process and may affect the ability to reach a particular target percent of TDS of coffee in solution and a particular percent extraction if the ratio of coffee to water is determined at an incorrect temperature. Since the density of water changes as a function of temperature, the volume of water to weight of coffee ratios are affected accordingly. To further illustrate this problem, commercial brewer-extractors are typically preset to approximately 200 degrees F. and volume is calibrated at the boiler set point, whereas a home brewer typically uses water at tap or room temperature, i.e. an ambient temperature of approximately 50-65 degrees F. The volume of a given weight of water at room temperature will be significantly less than the volume of the same weight of water at 200 degrees F., because water is more dense at ambient than at 200 degrees. This scenario can lead to inaccurate brewing results when using the coffee brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIG. 4A is substantially the same coffee control brewing chart of FIG. 3 except that the x axis is now expressed in percent extraction, a more convenient unitless method of expression, instead of ounces extracted per pound of coffee. For example, if 3.2 ounces of coffee are extracted from 16 ounces of coffee, this corresponds to 20% extraction by weight. While the parameters of the x axis and y axis are expressed in percent, the brew formula of FIG. 4A remains in units of gallons of water per pound of coffee, as was the case in the brewing chart of FIG. 3. FIGS. 4B-4E show a similar conventional representation of the typical brewing chart in common use today. For each brew batch size and unit of measure, separate conventional representations are needed, where such representations show separate brew formulas each labelled for the weight of ground coffee called for in that dedicated batch size. FIGS. 4B-4E show separate charts required for each separate batch size, and units of measure used, including gallons of brew water per ounce of ground coffee, similarly half-gallons per ounce, liters per gram and quarts per ounce. Expressed alternatively, FIG. 4B is a conventional brewing chart for grams coffee per liter water. FIG. 4C is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 gallon water. FIG. 4D is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per half gallon water. FIG. 4E is a conventional brewing chart for ounces coffee per 1.0 quart water. FIG. 5 shows the universal coffee brewing chart that the disclosed coffee design software application may generate. Rectangle 505 denotes a region of interest of acceptable strength in percent total dissolved solids (% TDS or solubles concentration) and extraction percent (solubles yield) that are found to be very desirable for the experienced palate, typically from approx. 1.2% to approx. 1.4% strength and approx. 19% to approx. 21% extraction, more typically from approx. 1.15% to approx. 1.55% strength and approx. 18% to approx. 22% extraction. Such regions of interest may be defined specifically as being best suited for particular coffee cultivars, regions, roast styles, and terroir, and may be developed specifically as preferences or suggested recipes for brewing particular coffees, and may be further developed as a result of consumer taste profiles and overlaid as new regions of interest to suit a particular consumer preference, roaster preference or user preference. For example, consumer preferences may be plotted on an additional z-scale, and consider an n-point scale (from “like intensely” to “dislike intensely”) which is plotted as a three-dimensional surface chart, where the y-scale is solubles concentration (%) and the X-scale is solubles yield (%). The surface chart may then be resolved to a colorized two-dimensional chart by viewing the three-dimensional chart from the top, and plotting the z-axis (consumer preference) in colors and in two dimensions, along with the traditional solubles yield (percent extraction) and solubles concentration (percent TDS, strength) superimposed on the same two-dimensional chart. Such a representation may provide an update to the most recent “optimum balance” regions of interest, and as corrected for brew water temperature. Brew formula line 510 represents the brew formula of water and coffee and makes the brew formula a dimensionless unit of measure by stating brew formula as a ratio (e.g. 17.19) of water to coffee by weight. This ratio remains constant despite variations in size of coffee batches brewed or the units used, thereby eliminating a requisite of separate brewing control charts for each different unit of measure or changes in batch size, as required in the past with conventional brewing control charts. Unfortunately, the conventional brewing control charts of FIGS. 1-3, 4A-4E are not flexible because a different brewing control chart is needed each time brewing batch size or units of measure changes. Moreover in these conventional charts, mixed units of volume of water are used with weight measurement units of coffee, mandating a new chart whenever a unit of measure or batch size changed. However, in one embodiment, the disclosed coffee design application and system is capable of generating a universal coffee brewing control chart that is stepless in portion sizes and continuous as coffee batch size, brew formulas, extraction and strength changes and as other variables change. The universal coffee brewing control chart also manages variable and mixed units, for example, brew water may be specified in gallons and coffee weight in grams, or water in liters and coffee weight in ounces. The disclosed coffee design application converts water volume at the temperature specified to weight to plot the correct brew formula ratio. Previous original brewing charts assumed water at room temperature, and conventional charts assumed water at 140 degrees F. as corrected for the hydrometer instrument used. However, the disclosed coffee design application corrects for the actual brew water temperature. The disclosed coffee design application will replot the control chart steplessly and in real time as the user changes design inputs. For example, as brew strength increases, brew formula line 505 may be continuously replotted to the left and higher in FIG. 5. Likewise, as brew strength decreases, brew formula line 505 may shift continuously to the right and lower in FIG. 5. With each change in the brew formula line, all other design output parameters are calculated and displayed continuously and in real time, and portions are determined based on actual start and brew water temperatures to maintain portions true to the brew formula ratio, eliminating previous errors in the range of 2-4%. With the universal coffee brew control chart that this application provides, there is no need for a series of different brew control charts for each batch size or units of measure. The following EQUATION 1 determines Percent Extraction using the Brew Formula Ratio, Water Density at Brew Temp and Percent TDS as variables for drip brewing. More particularly, from TDS %=0 to TDS %=10, the disclosed coffee design application determines Extraction for each TDS point using EQUATION 1: EXTRACTION %=(BF Ratio−water density_(g/ml@brew Temp)*waterLost_ml/g_coffee)/(1/TDS %−0.01))  EQUATION 1 To calculate Extraction % using this equation, Brew Formula Ratio (BF Ratio) should first be determined from the user input using the Strength Slider (TDS %) setting and the Target Extraction %. If the user changes the Strength Slider, then the BF Ratio changes and the brew formula line moves to a new location on the brew chart. Water density at brew temperature and water lost per gram are constants. Equation 1 is not a linear equation. The disclosed coffee design application plots the resulting point pairs on the control chart of FIG. 5 to draw the brew formula line 510 . The brew formula ratio (BR Ratio) may be equivalently expressed as a ratio of coffee weight to water weight with appropriate rearrangement of EQUATION 1. The brew formula line 510 is drawn from generated data point pairs by incrementing Percent TDS from 0 to 10 and calculating Percent Extraction. The universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction, namely change in TDS over change in extraction. The Brew Formula is used to calculate these point pairs. As will be explained in more detail below, the disclosed coffee design application will plot the intended coffee design as a small circle 515 (red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . Subsequently, after brewing a sample batch of coffee according to the specified design parameters and measuring the total dissolved (TDS %) with the disclosed coffee refractometer, the disclosed coffee application will plot the actual measured coffee design as a large circle 520 (blue plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield) on the brew formula line 510 . FIG. 6A shows an information handling system 600 on which the coffee design application may execute as a computer program product. More particularly, FIG. 6 shows an information handling system (IHS) 600 that includes coffee design application 602 and an operating system 606 . IHS 600 may initially store coffee design application 602 as a computer program product on a medium 608 , such as a CD, DVD or other medium. In this particular embodiment, IHS 600 includes a processor 610 having multiple compute elements (CEs) on a common semiconductor die 612 . IHS 600 processes, transfers, communicates, modifies, stores or otherwise handles information in digital form, analog form or other form. IHS 600 includes a bus 615 that couples processor 610 to system memory 620 via a memory controller 625 and memory bus 630 . A video graphics controller 635 couples display 640 to bus 615 . Nonvolatile storage 645 , such as a hard disk drive, CD drive, DVD drive, or other nonvolatile storage couples to bus 615 to provide IHS 600 with permanent storage of information. Operating system 606 loads in memory 620 to govern the operation of IHS 600 . I/O devices 650 , such as a keyboard and a mouse pointing device, couple to bus 615 via I/O controller 655 and I/O bus 660 . One or more expansion busses 665 , such as USB, IEEE 1394 bus, ATA, SATA, PCI, PCIE and other busses, couple to bus 615 to facilitate the connection of peripherals and devices to IHS 600 . A network interface adapter 670 couples to bus 615 to enable IHS 600 to connect by wire or wirelessly to a network and other information handling systems. While FIG. 6A shows one IHS that employs processor 610 , the IHS may take many forms. For example, IHS 600 may take the form of a desktop, server, portable, laptop, notebook, or other form factor computer or data processing system. IHS 600 may take other form factors such as a gaming device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld computing device, a portable telephone device, a communication device or other devices that include a processor and memory. A user of IHS 600 loads medium 608 into IHS 600 to store coffee design application 602 on non-volatile storage 645 as coffee design application 602 ′. When IHS 600 initializes, the IHS loads operating system 606 into system memory 620 for execution as operating system 606 ′. The IHS also loads coffee design application 602 ′ into system memory 620 for execution as coffee design application 602 ″. FIG. 6B shows a hand-held information handling system 675 that exhibits a small form factor such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). For example, IHS 675 may be a portable telephone type device or hand-held computer, such as an IHS that executes Microsoft Windows CE, or a Palm Pilot type device or an iPhone type IHS or smart phone. (PalmPilot is a trademark of Palm, Inc. iPhone is a trademark of Apple Inc.) In this embodiment, coffee design application 602 is embedded within the small form factor IHS as shown in FIG. 6B. In more detail, hand-held IHS 675 includes a microcontroller 676 that includes an internal memory 677 and firmware 678 . IHS 675 includes a non-volatile memory 679 coupled to microcontroller 676 . In one embodiment, non-volatile memory 679 stores coffee design application 602 therein as shown. In another embodiment, firmware 678 may contain coffee design application 602 or memory 677 may contain coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 includes a sensor package 680 that includes an accelerometer sensor 681 , a proximity sensor 682 , a touch sensor 683 and a photo sensor 684 . Sensor package 680 couples to microcontroller 676 . IHS 675 further includes an RF communication package 685 that includes a 3 G/GPRS/GSM phone communication module 686 , and EDGE phone communication module 687 , an IEEE 802.11 network communication module 688 and a Bluetooth local communication module 689 . RF communication package 686 couples to microcontroller 676 . Both a touch sensitive display 690 and a camera 691 couple to microcontroller 676 as shown. A global positioning system (GPS) module 692 also couples to microcontroller 676 to provide position information thereto. In one embodiment, sensor package 680 generates a first position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a first spatial position or orientation such as a horizontal position, for example, with respect to a particular reference point. Sensor package 680 generates a second position signal when IHS 675 exhibits a second spatial position or orientation such as a vertical position with respect to the particular reference point. IHS 675 is configured to send the first and second position signals to coffee design application 602 . IHS 675 is further configured such that coffee design application receives user input from touch screen display 690 when sensor package 680 generates the first position signal indicating that the IHS 675 is in the first position. Coffee design application 602 responds to the first position signal and accepts user input when it receives the first position signal. For example, such user input may include user input preferences to set modes and temperatures, and user input commands to accept % TDS strength and other input variables using a combination of touch screen commands, buttons and text or number entry modes. When coffee design application 602 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second position, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response computes and plots the solution and charts results of the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula curve, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . In other words, the user holds IHS 676 horizontally while inputting information and flips the IHS 675 to a vertical position to command that IHS 675 draw a universal brewing control chart on the display 690 . It is noted that the first and second positions are described as being horizontal and vertical, respectively, for purposes of example. The disclosed IHS applies as well to other first and second positions or spatial orientations without departing from the spirit of the invention. FIG. 7 depicts a textual representation of the disclosed coffee design process including 1) setting user preferences at set preferences block 705 , 2) conducting the design protocol at design protocol block 710 , 3) performing a total dissolved solids (TDS) measurement with a refractometer at TDS measurement block 715 , 4) correcting the brew protocol if necessary (included in block 715 ), 5) saving data at block 720 , and 6) printing data at block 725 . The process also includes providing help information at block 730 . The processor further includes an “about the program” block 730 with design credits, legal notices and license key information. FIG. 7 provides a high level overview of the coffee design process. The screen shots of FIG. 8A-8J will provide more detail with respect to the coffee design process and are discussed below following discussion of the FIG. 7 high level process. The user sets preferences in set preferences block 705 . More particularly, the user may select one of three different coffee design modes as a starting preference, namely: Start By Entering 1) brewing water volume 2) desired coffee yield or 3) ground coffee weight. In brewing water volume design mode, the user inputs starting brewing water volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS as input values. In response, coffee design application 602 determines or computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely ground coffee weight and resulting coffee yield volume. In desired coffee yield mode, the user inputs the desired coffee yield in volume and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight. In ground coffee weight mode, the user inputs the ground coffee weight and the desired strength (solubles concentration) % TDS. In response, coffee design application 602 computes the brew formula, and determines the remaining two variables, namely the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume. In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may select the starting water temperature. In one embodiment, the default starting water temperature is 55 degrees F. However, a user may select a starting water temperature between 55 and 70 degrees F. if the user is using a home brewer with bottled or tap water. The user may also select a brewing temperature in block 705 . The default brewing temperature is 201 degrees F. in one embodiment. The user may select a brewing temperature that is typically between 190 and 205 degrees F. The user may also specify temperature units in degrees F. or degrees C. in block 705 . In set starting preferences block 705 , the user may also select target settings for the coffee brewing process. For example, the user may input a coffee target extraction (solubles yield). The default coffee target coffee extraction is 20%, but for some coffees, a user may want to target a lower value, such as 19.5%, to emphasize sweetness, or sugars content, typical of high elevation grown coffees, for example. For other coffees that lack certain types of acidic components, one may want to select a higher target extraction, such as 22%, for example, since higher solubles yield (extraction) of that particular coffee will not extract bitter components. The user may also specify an iced coffee target extraction for which the default is 19%, to emphasize sweetness. The user may also specify a finished iced coffee target TDS strength for which the default is 2% after dilution and brewing over ice. The user may also specify and input brew chart preferences such as enabling pan and zoom on the universal brewing chart (discussed below), turning on and off taste defect labels and turning on and off region labels, as well as specifying custom regions of interest by particular coffees and or consumer preference regions. In a special case, ICED Coffee final strength target is set by the user as a preference to provide the coffee design application an input for calculation of 97% ice melt (and dilution) of concentrate which starts at a concentration strength TDS of 3.8%, and ending up at 2.0% after dilution (ICE melt). In the design protocol block 710 of the process flow of FIG. 7, the user may select or input desired starting value units. For example, for coffee yield the user may specify volume units such as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In another embodiment, coffee yield units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In an other embodiment, brew water units may be selected as weights, rather than volume, for example, grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may then enter input value in the units selected in the previous step, as well as the desired strength in percent TDS. For example, in the case of coffee yield in volume, the user may specify the desired coffee yield as 2 liters, or 1.5 gallons. For ground coffee weight, the user may specify one of grams, kilograms, ounces or pounds. For water volume, the user may specify as milliliters, liters, fluid ounces, quarts or gallons. In each mode, the % TDS is also selected as in an input value. For coffee brewing protocols, brew water and coffee yield are typically measured in volume for practical reasons, due to the ease of measurement of such bulk in volume versus weight, as long as temperature (and density) are taken into account. However, in espresso, or single-serve coffee, where volumes are typically much smaller, for example, for a single-serve portion, measurements are more practical and also more accurate when specified in weight. In the design protocol block 710 , the user may also input a selection that the start temperature is the brew temperature if desired. More particularly, the user may select a “start temperature=brew temperature” checkbox (discussed below in FIG. 8) by checking such box if using a commercial brewer with a boiler tank or may leave the checkbox unchecked if using a home brewer with tap or bottled at 50-75 degrees F. The user may also select the desired strength preference within design protocol block 710 . The user may adjust and select the desired strength preference by moving an adjustable strength slider (discussed below in FIG. 8). The adjustable strength slider selects desired strength in total dissolved solids (TDS) percent. The TDS range accessible by the strength slider is based on beverage type. For hot coffee, the selectable range varies from 1.0-2.0% in one embodiment. The user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 2.00% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range′” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Alternatively, the user may select an extended strength range, such as a range between 0.40 and 3.60% in one embodiment by checking an “Extended Range 2” checkbox in set preferences block 705 (discussed below in FIG. 8). Extended ranges are useful for troubleshooting existing coffee brewing protocols in the field that are being evaluated to be corrected, and may not be within normal ranges, due to significant brew formula portioning errors in excess of 5-8%, for example, or excessive extraction errors, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 4%, to cover a range more appropriate for coffee concentrates, such as for iced coffee, or for hot coffee to be diluted to a desired strength preference by addition of hot water to the brewed concentrate, for a single serve beverage brewer, for example. In another embodiment, the user may select any extended strength range, such as a range between 3.0% and 18%, to cover a range more appropriate for espresso, for example. Upon selection of the desired strength preference and the other input values and selection of units, coffee design application 602 generates a brew formula curve or line which is plotted on a universal coffee brewing chart such as shown in FIG. 5. Recall that the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 plots Percent TDS vs. Percent Extraction. The slope of the brew formula line 510 is delta TDS over delta Extraction. The Brew Formula Ratio is used to calculate point pairs using Equation 1. The plotted brew formula line takes into account the volume of water as a function of temperature, and computes the correct weight of coffee required to meet the specified brewing protocol, and the resulting finished coffee yield. The target strength selected is plotted on the brew formula line as a small circle 515 (red point) and represents the targeted design parameters. The user then proceeds to brew the coffee using the design output parameters that coffee design application 602 generates. If the user selected brew water volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the resulting coffee yield volume and required ground coffee weight values corresponding to those input conditions. If the user selected desired coffee yield volume and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and ground coffee weight values corresponding to that input condition. If the user selected coffee weight and % TDS as input conditions, coffee design application 602 then determines the required brew water volume and resulting coffee yield volume corresponding to those input conditions. The user then employs the particular input conditions and corresponding values to actually brew a test batch of coffee. As part of the coffee design process of FIG. 7, the user brews a sample of the targeted design batch of coffee as specified by the input conditions and corresponding determined variable values or results. The user places a sample of the test batch into the disclosed coffee refractometer (see FIG. 10 below) to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % by measuring the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Before using the refractometer, the user first calibrates the refractometer using distilled water. The refractometer and water should preferably be within the temperature range of 20 degrees-25 degrees C., in one embodiment. The user cools a 10-20 ml sample of the brewed coffee to between 20 degrees C. and 30 degrees C. The user places the cooled sample into the refractometer and allows 1-2 minutes for the sample and the refractometer to reach the same temperature. After temperature stabilization, the user takes a TDS % reading, as per bock 715 . The user then enters the TDS reading into coffee design application 602 . In response, coffee design application 602 adds a large circle plot point 520 (blue point) on the same brew formula line 510 of the universal coffee brewing chart of FIG. 5 generated during the design step. The large circle (blue point) % TDS measurement shows where the current coffee batch falls on that chart relative to the intended design point 515 (small red plot point) for strength (solubles concentration) and extraction (solubles yield). After observing where the current coffee batch results appear on the universal coffee brewing chart, the user may take corrective action, if necessary, to ensure that the final coffee design for subsequent batches of coffee falls within the parameters of the desired region of interest. Such corrective action may include: 1) Under-Extraction: If the blue large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, below and to the left on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was under-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with under-developed flavors. Common causes of under-extraction are too coarse a grind, too short a contact time with water during the brew period, lack of pre-infusion or pre-infusion levels too low and/or time too short, water too hard (mineral content too high), brew temperature too low, and/or lack of even wetting or turbulence in the brew basket. 2) Over-Extraction: If the large circle plot point 520 (blue point) is outside of the desired region of interest, above and to the right on the brew formula line 510 , the batch was over-extracted, and likely exhibits a taste defect associated with over-extracted bitter flavors. Common causes of over-extraction are too fine a grind, too long a contact time with water during the brew period, pre-infusion levels too high and/or time too long, too much turbulence in the brew basket, water too soft (too low a mineral content), and/or brew temperature too high. FIGS. 8C, 8E and 8G depict screen shots of coffee design application 602 that show different startup modes that are selectable via user Startup Preferences (FIG. 8A), with input selections and corresponding outputs and universal brew formula plotted on charts 8 B, 8 D and 8 F. More particularly, the following design modes are selectable via user startup preferences: 1) brew water volume 2) desired coffee yield and 3) ground coffee weight. The user selects one of the 3 modes as starting input variables in coffee design application 602 . In response to this selection and percent TDS as inputs, coffee design application 602 determines the remaining 2 variables as outputs. For example, if the user selects brewing water volume (and selects a % TDS) as the starting variable or mode, coffee design application 602 determines a corresponding coffee yield and coffee ground weight. Alternatively, if the user selects desired coffee yield (and selects a % TDS), then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and coffee ground weight needed to achieve this desired coffee yield. This mode is a particularly useful and valuable tool for the coffee trade because it promotes better brewing practice. For example, typically, a brewer may be programmed to dispense water volume in units of gallons, for example one-half gallon. However, the user may be brewing into a commonly available 2.2 or 2.5 liter brewing thermos. Typical yield under these conditions will be approximately 1.7 liters, leaving 0.5 to 0.7 liters in the thermos empty. Coffee brewed in this manner will degrade more rapidly because it cools more quickly, and loses aromatic volatiles that evaporate and condense inside the empty portion of the thermos. Selecting this mode will automatically adjust the required brew water volume and ground coffee required to yield a full batch sized to the thermos is use. Using coffee design application 602 , any units of brew water volume, desired coffee yield and ground coffee weight may be selected to suit the actual conditions in the field. Alternatively, if the user selects coffee ground weight (at the desired % TDS strength) as a starting variable or mode, then coffee design application 602 determines the required brewing water volume and resulting coffee yield. This mode is particularly useful for users of pre-ground coffee packets (pillow-packs), where the user selects a fixed coffee portion and desired percent TDS (strength) and application 602 outputs the required brew water volume and resulting yield to brew to gold-cup standards. Coffee design application 602 generates three windows that help to design and measure brewing parameters. These windows are 1) a startup preferences or brewing preferences window, 2) a main application window and a 3) universal brewing control chart. Coffee design application 602 charts parameters and provides instant feedback so that adjustments, when necessary, can be made quickly and effectively by the user. FIG. 8A shows a Startup Preferences window 801 that coffee design application 602 generates to enable the user to input operating modes and preferences. Preferences (including changes) are saved automatically between application sessions. The user starts a first design session using the Default Preferences. Upon entering startup preferences window 801 , the user selects a preferred design mode in the “Start by Entering” area 802 in the upper left corner of window 801 . The user selects one of the three buttons in the “Start by Entering” area 802 , namely 1) the Water Volume button 803 —Select this option to design by entering the Brew Water Volume amount. In this mode, the software determines or calculates the ground coffee and coffee yield amounts based on user strength TDS selected, 2) the Desired Coffee Yield (Vol) button 804 —Select this option to design by entering the Desired Coffee Yield Volume; in this mode, the coffee design application software 202 determines or calculates the ground coffee and brew water amounts based on user strength TDS selected, or 3) the Ground Coffee Weight button 805 —Select this option if you are working with a fixed weight of coffee, such as a pillow pack. In this mode, the coffee design application software 202 calculates the brew water volume and coffee yield volume amounts based on user strength TDS selected. The user may select the “Start Value=Last Used” checkbox 806 if the user desires the coffee design application 602 to remember the mode and values used in the last session upon the next startup of the application. Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Target Settings” area 807 where the user may input Hot Coffee Target Extraction % at box 808 . For standard drip brewing of coffee, this default is set to 20 percent extraction, an industry standard “starting point” applicable to a wide range of coffees. For a sweeter cup, the user may try 18.5-19.5 percent, depending on taste preferences, the particular coffee, degree of roast, and grade of grind. Note that extracting to lower targeted levels will require more coffee to achieve the same strength preference. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Extraction at box 809 . For iced coffee, the default target extraction of 19% results in a sweeter cup that is significantly less bitter than a setting of 20% would provide. With higher elevation grown coffees rich in sugars, this recipe often results in a sweet tasting batch without the use of supplemental sweeteners. In “Target Settings” area 807 , the user may also input the Iced Target Strength at box 810 . For iced coffee, this is the final result of the concentrate after 95-97% all of the ice has melted at the end of the brew. The concentrate is ready to use immediately after the brew cycle has completed. Box 811 indicates the current strength (% TDS) range selected for the available design and chart range. If the user selects normal range checkbox 811 A, then box 811 displays a strength range of 1.15-1.55%. If the user selects “Extended Range 1” checkbox 811 B, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-2.00%. If the user selects “Extended Range 2” checkbox 811 C, then box 811 displays a strength range of 0.4-3.6%. These ranges extend the user selectable TDS strength range and also resize the Y-axis on the universal brewing control chart accordingly, and is useful for troubleshooting existing brewing protocols in the field that are out-of-range and off the universal brew chart region of interest Startup Preferences window 801 includes “Water Temperatures” area 812 where the user may input the starting temperature of the water in the brewer at “Start” box 813 and the actual brew temperature of the water in the brewer at “Brew” box 814 . The user may select either a degrees F. or a degrees C. scale at temperature scale selection box 812 A. For example, the user should select the Brew Temp at Brew box 814 to the programmed setting of the user's brewer (usually 195-202 Deg F) for light to medium roasted coffees, slightly lower, i.e., 195 Deg F for dark roasted coffees. The user may enter the start temperature at Start Temperature box 813 to what may typically be in use at home, which should be equal to either TAP water temperature or room temperature (i.e., for bottled water). Using the start and brew temperatures specified, application 602 determines the actual brew water volume and ground coffee weight required to maintain the correct brew formula ratio, a common cause of error when trying to transfer brew formulas from a commercial to a home brewer for example. Preferences window 801 further includes a “Chart Settings” area 815 for setting preferences in the universal brewing control chart that coffee design application 602 generates. In one embodiment coffee design application 602 may allow the displaying of stored or custom regions of interest for optimum balance to be overlaid onto the universal brewing control chart. Coffee taste preference “regions” have been previously defined by different organizations (i.e. Midwest Research Institute (MRI), Coffee Brewing Center (CBC), Norwegian Coffee Center (NCC) as the “Optimum Balance” regions, or, as shown, other custom regions may be added to the chart based on individual preferences found to be appropriate for particular coffees, roast styles, and or customer surveys. Such custom regions need not be rectangular, as shown, but may be any shape including three dimensional, exhibiting preferences in percentile categories. Selecting the “Show Region Labels” checkbox 816 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a label identifying the region of interest. Selecting the “Show Taste Labels” checkbox 817 instructs the coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart that displays taste defect labels (i.e., bitter or under-developed). Selecting the “Enable Zoom/Pan” checkbox 818 instructs coffee design application 602 to generate a Universal Brewing Control Chart on which the user may use mouse and/or trackpad controls to zoom/pan the Universal Brewing Control Chart along with its axis. The final universal brewing control chart as configured, plotted and labeled may be saved in any commonly available formats (such as jpeg, png, bmp, emf, gif, tif), emailed, entered into a database, electronically shared, and or printed on demand. Upon completion of entering input preferences and settings in startup preferences window 801 , the user may select Done box 819 . After the Startup Preferences have been selected as described above, the user completes the brewing protocol design process in the coffee design application 602 in the Main Application Window shown in FIG. 8C. More details on using the Main Application Window discussed below with reference to FIG. 8C. However, before discussion Main Application Window in detail, it is helpful to first discuss the Universal Brewing Control Chart of FIG. 8B that coffee design application 602 produces. Coffee design application 602 performs all calculations and plots a brewing control chart dynamically and in real time as you change the % TDS strength preference slider control. Coffee design application 602 converts between different types of units instantly and accurately, and allows for mixed units (i.e., brew water in gallons, coffee yield in liters). Coffee design application 602 draws a custom brew formula line on a universal brewing control chart using any combination of selected units in weight and or volume, without restrictions to fixed portions. Application 602 also provides a relative indication of designed recipe to the measured results, in reference to a number of internationally recognized “optimum” brewing ranges. Application 602 further provides a means to troubleshoot current brewing protocols, measure and plot results which immediately identify portioning and extraction errors, and provides a means to correct them. The appearance of the Main Design Window of FIG. 8C depends on the variable the user selected to enter as the INPUT data in the Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A. Coffee design application 602 displays the computed OUTPUT data immediately below in the next group box of the window, and plots the results on the Universal Brewing Control Chart dynamically and in real time in a charting window seen in FIG. 8B. The completed data and universal brewing control chart as configured, labeled and plotted on the Main Application Window may be saved, recalled, electronically shared, printed or emailed. Each “recipe” may be stored separately, or in one embodiment of the application 602 , as part of a database residing within the application or as part of a shared networked database application. FIG. 8B shows a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 that includes a representative coffee brew formula line 821 . The Universal Brewing Control Chart plots the actual design point 822 (small circle) and measured results 823 (large circle) from input data and % TDS measurements from the disclosed coffee refractometer. FIG. 8B shows a typical universal coffee brewing control chart 820 , taken from the brew formula discussed below. FIG. 8B shows the desired brew formula line as brew formula line 821 . The brew formula line 821 represents the ratio (17.08:1) of water to coffee by weight used to brew the coffee. The resulting TDS of the brewed coffee will be determined by the brew formula, as well as other factors (temperature, grade of grind, dwell time, and turbulence). The final % TDS measurement 823 may then be followed down to the X-axis, to see how close the results (19.8%) came to the design target extraction (20.0%). The small circle 822 on the Brew Formula line shows the selected strength design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 on the brew formula line 821 shows the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring and inputting the TDS % of the brewed coffee into coffee application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. The actual resulting extraction and strength are plotted as a result of the TDS % measurement on a specialized coffee refractometer disclosed and discussed below in more detail. Universal brewing control chart 820 includes a number of coffee design target regions of interest. Chart 820 shows the George Howell Coffee Company (GHCC) suggested target region of interest as region of interest 824 for optimum balance. Chart 820 also shows a Midwest Research Institute region of interest 825 . Chart 820 further shows a target region of interest 826 defined by the Norwegian Coffee Center. FIG. 8C shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew from the starting water volume is now discussed, namely the water volume mode. The Startup Preferences discussed earlier set up the main window for this water volume mode, including brew water temperature to match the brewer boiler setting in use. The brew water volume is first calibrated, according to the brewer manufacturer specifications, to dose correctly the amount of water programmed as the starting brew water volume. The user then performs the following coffee design steps: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left-hand corner of main application window 827 . 2. Enter the preferred Brew Water units in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Water Volume field 830 , and enter the Water Volume in the Water Volume field 830 . For example, the user may enter a brew water volume value of 0.50 gal. in Water Volume field 830 . 3. Select the preferred Strength TDS % with the slider 831 on the window's left side. In response to the above described user design inputs, application software 602 determines the brew formula and the corresponding required Ground Coffee weight and final Coffee Yield. Coffee design application 602 then displays the determined Ground Coffee weight at Ground Coffee weight box 833 and displays the final Coffee Yield at Coffee Yield box 832 . Final values, including the brew formula ratio, are also displayed in the legend of the brewing control chart. The units are selectable by the user at units select boxes 834 and 835 . In this example, the resultant yield is 56.52 fl oz (US) and the ground coffee weight is 3.75 oz (wt.) The coffee design application 602 draws the brew formula curve 821 as seen in the universal coffee brewing control chart of FIG. 8D. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target Strength TDS 822 at the pre-set target extraction of 20%. 4. If not done earlier, the user may enter the preferred units of measure in the two output fields, namely Coffee Yield volume 834 and Ground Coffee weight 835 of FIG. 8C. Alternatively, the user may convert these units to any desired units using boxes 834 and 835 . 5. After brewing in accordance with the above parameters, the user may test the total dissolved solids (TDS) using the disclosed coffee refractometer. The user may enter the measured % TDS in the Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 after selecting TDS % at box 837 as the instrument readout mode. Alternatively, coffee design application 602 will provide a conversion estimate for TDS % using box 837 that may be set to ppm or BRIX if another TDS instrument or refractometer provides readings in those units. 6. The user may use a File>Save menu selection to save the brew formula, chart and portion plan, and may print the same if desired. To summarize, in the above example, beverage type was set to Hot Coffee, brew water volume was set to 0.50 gallons, and the strength slider 831 was set to 1.3% as the desired coffee strength. Coffee design application 602 determines the brew formula ratio, the required ground coffee in oz-wt and the resulting brewed coffee yield in fl-oz volume. Brew temperature was the same as start temperature at 201 Deg F. FIG. 8E shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the second mode, namely, coffee yield as input, is now discussed as coffee yield mode. Traditionally, brew formulas have been developed using a pre-set volume of brew water as part of the brew recipe. For example, a one (1) gallon batch meant setting the brewer for one gallon of brew water, and using approximately 7.5 ounces coffee (i.e., the gold-cup standard for 1.3% TDS). However, this method results in a final yield of approximately 112-fluid ounces, leaving about 16-fl oz empty in the brewing vessel. In the Desired Yield mode, the disclosed coffee design application 602 enables the user to specify one (1) gallon of finished coffee to fill the brewing vessel completely. In one embodiment, coffee design application 602 determines exact portions of brew water and ground coffee required, for example 1.13 gallons of brew water and 8.5 ounces of coffee. This design mode allows the user to specify the finished yield needed to fill a brewing thermos, rather than leave a significant percentage empty. Units can be mixed in any combination (brew water in gallons, yield in liters), and coffee design application 602 determines the required results in the units specified. For example, for a 2.5 liter thermos, 0.75 gallons brew water and 5.6 ounces of coffee will yield exactly 2.5 liters of finished coffee. To ensure accurate portions of water and coffee, coffee design application 602 takes into account the water lost in the spent basket and the volume of water required as a function of temperature. The brew basket refers to a vessel (not shown) that holds coffee grounds in the correct depth and area in the brewer for proper wetting and extraction during the coffee brewing process. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Desired Coffee Yield button 804 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8E and enters the desired coffee yield into Desired Coffee Yield box 830 as shown in FIG. 8E. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Set the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 [in the lower left corner of main application window 827 ] to select the Hot Coffee charting range. 2. Select the preferred units of measure of the Desired Yield in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Desired Yield field box 830 , and enter the Desired Yield for the finished coffee in Desired Yield field box 830 . For example, the user may select liters in box 829 and 2.35 in box 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields at Brew Water Volume unit selection box 834 and Ground Coffee Weight unit selection box 835 . In this particular example, coffee design application 602 determines the required Brew Water Volume in liters and the Ground Coffee weight required in grams. When using a commercial brewer, the user should check Start=Brew Temperature box 838 to indicate that the starting temperature is equal to the brewing temperature. 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.27 TDS % in this example. 5. After brewing a batch of coffee under the input conditions above, the user may measure the total dissolved solids in the batch of coffee from a sample thereof. The user places a sample of the brewed batch in the disclosed coffee refractometer discussed in more detail below. The coffee refractometer measures Total Dissolved Solids in percent (%). The user takes a TDS reading from the coffee refractometer and enters the measured % TDS in the “Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement” field or box 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode facilitates better coffee brewing practice in a number of ways. For example, in this design mode, application 602 determines or calculates the coffee and water portions required to nearly fill the brewing vessel completely. This mode also reduces the amount of air in a thermos or other coffee brew receptacle, and reduces the loss of aroma producing volatiles, while increasing the volume of hot coffee brewed. The additional thermal mass of coffee keeps the thermos hot longer, and can increase hold times by up to 10-15 minutes per batch. This mode may also reduce the frequency of brewing, making a coffee brewing operation more efficient. This mode may allow brewing larger batches that inherently reduces portioning errors. In the “Desired Coffee Yield” design mode in the example of FIG. 8E, the Beverage Type is set to Hot Coffee at Beverage Type drop down menu 828 , and Desired Yield is set to 2.35 Liters in boxes 830 , 832 for a 2.5 Liter Thermos receptacle. Strength slider 831 is set to 1.27% TDS. The disclosed coffee refractometer is used to test a sample of the brewed coffee. In this example, the coffee refractometer measures a TDS value of 1.3%, which is entered by the user at Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement input box 836 . In response to entering the TDS value, coffee design application 602 plots a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ as shown in FIG. 8F. Universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ′ shows the brew formula, namely a brew formula line 821 ′, as a brew formula ratio of 17.56 to 1. Coffee design application 602 plots a small circle 822 ′ that indicates the selected strength coffee design target at the default extraction (20%). The larger circle 823 ′ on brew formula line 821 ′ indicates the actual resulting extraction and strength determined by measuring the TDS % of the brewed coffee sample with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputting the measured TDS % into coffee design application 602 as a total dissolved solids measurement. Since the measured coffee results are within 0.5% of the target extraction (solubles yield) of the design target, no further adjustment is required in this example. The final coffee design recipe values are also shown in the chart Legend 840 , at the bottom of the chart 820 ′. FIG. 8G shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 . As discussed above, depending on the initial preference settings, application 602 may be used to design coffee brew processes by a 1) a water volume mode, 2) a coffee yield mode or 3) a ground coffee mode. Planning a brew by specifying the third mode, namely ground coffee weight as input, is now discussed as ground coffee weight mode. Design by ground coffee weight is a commonly used in high volume feeder establishments using pre-measured, pre-ground pillow packs. While it is not preferable to pre-grind coffee for freshness reasons, this mode is provided to address such feeder establishments, so they can improve their coffee brewing practices to internationally accepted standards. The user selects Startup Preferences window 801 of FIG. 8A and then selects Ground Coffee Weight button 805 . The user returns to the main application window 827 of FIG. 8G and enters the ground coffee weight into ground coffee weight box 830 as shown in FIG. 8G. For example, if the weight of a pre-ground coffee pillow pack is 3.5 oz, then the user selects the unit ounces in unit selection box 829 and inputs 3.5 into box 830 as shown. The user may then follow the coffee design method steps below: 1. Select Hot Coffee in the Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 in the lower left corner of main application window 827 . 2. Select the preferred unit of measure in the drop-down menu 829 next to the Ground Coffee field 830 , and enter the weight in the Ground Coffee field 830 . 3. Select the preferred units of measure if necessary for the two calculated fields, namely Brew Water Volume and Yield. Coffee design application 602 determines or calculates the required Brew Water Volume and the final coffee Yield volume in the units selected. Start Temperature=Brew Temperature is checked at checkbox 838 . 4. Select the preferred Strength with the slider 831 . In this example, the user engages slider 831 to select a strength of 1.3%. 5. After brewing coffee in accordance with the determined parameters, the user then employs the disclosed coffee refractometer to measure the total dissolved solids, TDS, of a sample of the brewed coffee. The user enters the measured % TDS in the Enter Dissolved Solids Measurement field 836 . 6. Use the File>Save menu selection to save the brew plan, and print if desired. This example illustrates how to design to desired strength protocols using fixed ground coffee packets by weight. Coffee design application 602 calculates the required brew Water Volume and Yield volume of coffee in the units selected. The Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 was set to Hot Coffee. Ground Coffee was set to the packet size of 3.5 ounces weight. Strength slider was set to 1.30% TDS. Dissolved Solids were measured and entered at 1.3% Coffee design application 602 draws a universal coffee brewing control chart 820 ″ as shown in FIG. 8H. In FIG. 8H, box 824 ″ represents the desired target region and line 821 ″ represents the particular brew formula ratio, namely 17.19 to 1, in this particular example that employs 0.47 gallons of water and 3.5 oz (wt) of coffee to brew a batch of coffee. Small circle 822 ″ represents the desired design point on brew formula line 821 ″, while large circle 823 ″ represents the actual coffee design point determined in response to the measured TDS % of the brewed coffee batch measure in the disclosed coffee refractometer. Region 824 ″ is the particular region of interest on the brew control chart of FIG. 8H. This design mode is useful for users of pre-ground and pre-weighed fixed packs of ground coffee wishing to improve their coffee brewing protocols by providing a means to reprogram their brewers to brew to gold-cup standards, even though fixed weight packs have been provided. FIG. 8I shows the main application window 827 of coffee design application 602 which is also useful in designing coffee concentrates. This example shows an iced coffee design, where the user selects iced coffee in Beverage Type drop-down menu 828 . The coffee design application 602 will design coffee extraction protocols for Iced Coffee Concentrate, to be brewed fresh and directly over ice. Coffee design application 602 calculates coffee concentrate TDS strength both before and after ice is melted. The process is designed to allow approximately 95% to approximately 97% percent of the ice to melt at brew completion time, so that the finished concentrate is cold, and ready to serve immediately after brewing. In one embodiment, the complete brewing cycle takes only 5-6 minutes, typically. Care should be taken using this mode to choose portions that will not overload nor overflow the brew basket. For example, a 0.5-1.0 gallon brewer may be able to brew 7-9 ounces of ground coffee, but could overflow the brew basket if more ground coffee is used. Generally, a 1.5 gallon brewer can accommodate up to 12-14 ounces ground coffee. Design by coffee weight mode is supported in this embodiment, to ensure such limitations are adhered to, and application 602 determines the required brew water volume, concentrate yield, and weight of ice required. In this example, the user sets the coffee brew strength to 3.8% using slider 831 . The user employs brew water volume as the starting value in Enter Starting Value box 830 . The units are gallons in unit selection box 829 . In this example, it is assumed that a typical 1.5 gallon brewer is being used. The brewer is programmed to dispense 0.7 gallons, yielding approximately a half-gallon (0.49 gal) of coffee at 3.7% TDS. The coffee is brewed into an open top container containing 62 ounces-weight of ice, then stirred and covered. The resulting concentrate is after serving over ice in a glass filled two-thirds will be about 1.5-1.8% TDS. Total concentrate yield is just under one gallon. This serves approximately sixteen 16-oz servings (7.5 fl oz concentrate over approximately 8 oz-wt ice). Coffee design application 602 plots the resultant brew formula ratio curve 821 ′″ as seen in FIG. 8J. Coffee design application 602 also plots the target coffee design point as small circle 822 ′″. After the user measures the total dissolved solids TDS % with the disclosed coffee refractometer and inputs the TDS % value, for example 3.7%, in box 836 , application 602 plots the actual coffee design point at large circle 823 ′″ on brew formula ratio line 821 ′″. FIG. 9A is a flowchart that shows process flow in the methodology that the disclosed information handling system 600 employs. In one embodiment, when loaded into system 600 , coffee design application 602 of computer program product 608 enables system 600 to carry out this methodology.

System 600 queries the user to select a beverage type, namely hot coffee, iced coffee or in another embodiment, espresso, as per block 908 . The Beverage Type drop-down menu pre-sets 828 are used to adjust the brewing and chart areas of solubles concentration (% TDS Strength) and solubles yield (% Extraction) to the appropriate ranges commonly used for brewing the selected types of beverage(s). System 600 receives the user's Beverage Type selection as input to the coffee design process. System 600 presents a slider tool 831 to the user to enable the user to select a design coffee strength, as per block 910 . For example, the user may select a strength of 1.3% with the slider tool, or may also use arrow keys, touch screen controls or other methods for setting the input value. System 600 receives the user's selection of coffee strength as input to the coffee design process. System 600 determines the brew formula ratio using 1) weight of water, determined from the volume of the water at the prescribed brewing temperature 2) the target extraction percent (% solubles yield) and 3) the design TDS target strength (% solubles concentration) from the slider control (i.e. coffee strength), as per block 912 . The final brew formula ratio is equal to the weight of water divided by the weight of coffee as determined by the above parameters, and remains the same regardless of the brew batch size. System 600 generates a universal control chart graph including a grid showing TDS range (%) on the y axis vs. coffee extraction (%) on the x axis, as per block 914 . Using the brew formula ratio determined in block 912 , system 600 plots and displays on the universal control chart graph the brew formula line that represents the brew formula ratio. System 600 performs tests to determine if the user selected 1) brew water Volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, or 3) ground coffee weight mode at decision blocks 918 , 920 and 922 . If the user selected 1) brew water volume mode, then process flow continues to the brew water volume module of FIG. 9B, as per block 924 . If the user selected 2) desired coffee yield mode, then process flow continues to the desired coffee yield mode of FIG. 9C, as per block 926 . If the user selected 3) ground coffee weight mode, then process flow continues to ground coffee weight module of FIG. 9D, as per block 928 .

For example, the user employs touch screen display 690 to select startup preferences such as selecting one of multiple design modes, namely 1) brewing water volume mode, 2) desired coffee yield mode, and 3) ground coffee weight mode. The user may also make other input selections shown in startup preferences of FIG. 8A while IHS 675 is oriented in the first spatial orientation. In response to such input and when the user changes the spatial orientation of the IHS to a second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 draws a universal brewing control chart such as shown in FIGS. 8B, 8D, 8F, 8H and 8J on display 690 . The displayed universal control chart displays the results of user input which may include a TDS % reading from the disclosed refractometer for a brewed coffee sample that is brewed in accordance with the coffee design parameters that coffee design application 602 determines. In one embodiment, to complete the final plot point on the universal brewing control chart, the actual measured % TDS may be entered when IHS 675 is in either the first or second spatial position. For example, the measured % TDS from the disclosed coffee refractometer may be entered on touch screen display 690 on either the universal brewing control chart on the display while the IHS exhibits the second orientation (such as vertical) or the Main Application window while the IHS exhibits the first orientation (such as horizontal) by using extended touch screen commands that appear on the universal brewing control chart, for example, as buttons or data entry boxes, in a visible layer behind the partially transparent displayed chart. Generally, IHS 675 receives the user's input selections while IHS 675 exhibits the first spatial orientation while coffee design application 602 receives the first position signal from sensor package 680 . When coffee design application 602 of IHS 675 receives the second position signal, indicating that the user has changed the orientation of the IHS 675 to the second spatial orientation, coffee design application 602 senses this signal change and in response determines or calculates the solution to the user inputs, including but not limited to the brew formula, required portions of coffee and water, and draws a universal brewing control chart on display 690 . Specific recipes for any number of brew formula sessions may be stored in the IHS 675 as an integrated database in non-volatile memory 679 , and or transmitted to a database via any of a number of wireless protocols, including web-based sharing protocols, or electronically mailed to other users to share, and interactively modify, for example, based on a collaborative approach to establishing a desired brewing protocol. Such recipes may be used to control brewing protocols for an entire installed base of brewing equipment, such equipment being programmable manually or automatically to execute said protocol(s), through a manual, wired or wireless interface, for example, for feeder establishments wishing to maintain a high quality coffee brewing program to ensure consistency from cup-to-cup across its entire installed base of restaurants, cafes or coffee bars. As stated above with respect to the flowchart of FIG. 9A, system 600 determines the brew formula ratio using 1) weight of water, determined from the volume of the water at the prescribed brewing temperature 2) the target extraction percent (% solubles yield) and 3) the design TDS target strength (% solubles concentration) from the slider control (i.e. coffee strength), as per block 912 . The final brew formula ratio is equal to the weight of water divided by the weight of coffee as determined by the above parameters, and remains the same regardless of the brew batch size. System 600 generates a universal control chart graph including a grid showing TDS range (%) on the y axis vs. coffee extraction (%) on the x axis, as per block 914 . Using the brew formula ratio determined in block 912 , system 600 plots and displays on the universal control chart graph the brew formula line that represents the brew formula ratio. In an alternative embodiment, system 600 may consider other information and parameters in addition to those discussed above in determining brew formula ratio and extraction yield. For example, the extraction yield calculation or determination of Equation 1 above may be modified to normalize for different types of brewing, such as an infusion brewing process or a drip brewing process, just as the brew formula is normalized for brew water temperature when measured in units of volume to determine its weight. The nature of the universal brewing control chart is that it provides for the determination of normalized extraction yield for any number of different brewing parameters or methods. EXTRACTION %=(BF Ratio)/(1/TDS %−0.01)  EQUATION 8 Equation 8 applies to infusion, immersion or steeping processes or brewers, such as a French press (i.e. Press pot), Vacuum pot, AeroPress®, Eva Solo, Bunn Trifecta™, Clever® Dripper, Clover® or for coffee cupping which is a full immersion brew process that includes the practice by roasters of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffees. The extraction yield calculation or determination of Equations 1 and/or 8 above may be also be modified to adjust for CO2 gas content in the coffee and/or moisture content in the coffee. CO2 and moisture will both act to reduce the net effective weight of the ground coffee available to be extracted from, while the moisture would increase the net effective brew water amount. Both parameters therefore affect the brew formula, which can be normalized to provide more accurate determinations of actual extraction yield. A feature of the disclosed universal coffee brewing control chart methodology is to normalize extraction yield results for multiple brewing parameters such as: brew water start temperature when measured in units of volume, ground coffee moisture content, CO2 gas content of the ground coffee or whole bean coffee, the amount of liquid retained in the spent grounds, and the concentration of the of liquid retained in the spent grounds. Traditional brewing control brew charts dating from the 1950's assumed all methods were drip, that all brew water amounts were measured in units of volume at a fixed temperature, that ground coffee was pure coffee with no moisture content or CO2 gas, and that all methods retained two milliliters of brew water per gram of coffee. These assumptions required a different brewing control chart for different batch sizes, such as liters, gallons, cups and could be applied only to drip methods. The disclosed universal brewing control chart applies to all brewing methods and batch sizes with a single chart and normalizes results for multiple brewing parameters, such as those given above. In one embodiment, it is important to determine extraction yield accurately in order to compare coffee brewed with different methods and brewing parameters. The concept of normalized extraction yield in the disclosed universal brewing control chart provides an accurate determination of the soluble solids extracted from the ground coffee regardless of brew method and brewing parameters used. The level of solubles extracted is directly related to taste and more specifically to taste defects. Concentration or strength is more of a personal preference, and thus, coffees are consumed in a comparably wide range of less than 1.00% concentration (total dissolved solids as mass fraction g/100 g) to more than 14% concentration as espresso, while extraction yield is limited to a much smaller range of typically 18-22%, assuming standard grind profiles, with some exceptions. Extraction yield ranges are also affected by the particular coffees as well as the uniformity of grind profile, and in some cases can be preferred at higher extraction yields. To achieve consistent brewing results when extracting coffee using different brewing methods, the extraction yield calculations should be properly normalized to facilitate ready comparison of results. The disclosed coffee brewing methodology is in contrast to traditional coffee brewing control charts that provided for merely a single condition, for example drip methods of a single batch size gravity fed with brew water measured in volume at one temperature, and that the liquid retained was brew water at the fixed amount of 2 milliliters of water per gram of ground coffee and that the ground coffee was 100% coffee with no CO2 or moisture. The disclosed coffee brewing methodology with its universal coffee brewing control chart expresses brew formula as a ratio of brew water weight and coffee weight (corrects for brew water volume as a function of temperature), calculates brew formula and extraction yield for drip and infusion methods, provides for actual liquid retained amounts and concentration values, and further provides for moisture and CO2 content in ground coffee. FIG. 10A shows the disclosed refractometer 1000 that is usable to measure TDS % of a brewed coffee sample by determining the index of refraction of the brewed coffee sample. Refractometer 1000 includes a light source 1005 such as a yellow semiconductor laser that generates 589 nm light in one embodiment. An illumination lens 1010 directs the light from light source 1005 toward prism 1015 as shown. Prism 1015 receives incident light 1017 from light source 1005 as shown. Prism 1015 is a transparent material that exhibits an index of refraction “n p ”. The user or other entity or apparatus places a coffee brew sample 1020 on prism surface 1025 in preparation for measurement of the index of refraction “n s ” that the brew sample 1020 exhibits. A collection lens 1030 collects light 1032 refracted or reflected by the prism sample interface 1034 and directs that light to a linear photo detector 1035 . The purpose of the illumination lens 1010 is to direct light from light source 1005 to prism 1015 . More specifically, the purpose of illumination lens 1010 is to form a focusing beam or cone of light incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 that ranges in angles of incidence between a minimum angle of incidence, θ min , and a maximum angle of incidence, θ max. The angle of incidence is measured relative to the normal surface 1027 which is perpendicular to the prism surface 1025 . In one embodiment, the critical angle q c of the prism-sample interface 1034 should be such that θ min <θ c <θ max . A unique property of the critical angle is that for all angles larger than θ c , 100% of the light is reflected from the interface 1034 and none transmits. For angles inside of the prism 1015 that are less than θ c , some light transmits into the sample material 1020 and therefore less than 100% of the light is reflected. In other words, for all rays in the beam of light generated by illumination lens 1010 that are focused in the prism to an incident angle greater than the critical angle θ c , 100% of the light is reflected off of the prism-material interface 1034 and propagates towards the collection lens 1030 and then on to the linear detector 1035 or photodetector. The light ray that is incident upon the prism-sample interface 1034 at θ c will strike the linear detector 1035 at a point x=x c . By analyzing the detected light levels from x=0 to x=x max on the detector 1035 , the firmware 1047 or software of the refractometer detects the position x c since for x c <x<x max , the light level is substantially constant across the detector array 1035 . With a well-calibrated refractometer, the detector position x c is mapped back to a critical angle θ c , which from EQUATION 8.1 below and knowing the index of refraction of the prism n p , the index of refraction n s of the sample can be determined and displayed or otherwise reported. θ c =arcsin( n s /n p )  EQUATION 8.1 Therefore, in refractometer 1000 the index of refraction of the prism 1015 must satisfy n p >n s for all values of n s desired to be measured in order for a critical angle θ c to exist. Given the range of θ c resulting from the range of n s to be measured, the illumination lens 1010 arrangement is designed to include this range of angles relative to the surface normal 1027 of surface 1025 . Similarly, the collection lens 1030 is designed such that the range of angles θ c are linearly mapped to positions x on the linear detector array 1035 . By way of example, for a refractometer designed to operate with a sugar solution between 0 and 10° BRIX at 20° C., one requires the ability to detect indices of refraction ranging from 1.3330 to 1.3479. Using a source with a wavelength of λ 0 =589 nm and a prism made of BK7 (n p =1.5167@λ 0 ), the range of critical angles to detect are θ c =61.50° to 62.71°. Choosing an Eastman Kodak (Rochester, N.Y.) linear CCD array model KLI-2113 with an array of 2098 pixels for linear detector 1035 , the theoretical resolution is 7E-6 in index of refraction and 0.005° BRIX. In addition to being wavelength sensitive, the index of refraction for any material changes slightly with temperature. For water at 20° C. (68° F.) the index of refraction is 1.333 and changes by −0.0001 for every degree C. The disclosed coffee refractometer includes automatic temperature compensation as described in more detail below. Refractometer 1000 includes a microcontroller 1045 with control firmware 1047 or control software therein. Microcontroller 1045 includes a memory store 1049 for storage of information and data. Refractometer 1000 also includes a temperature sensor 1050 near the prism-sample interface 1034 of prism 1015 . Temperature sensor 1050 couples to an input of microcontroller 1045 to inform microcontroller 1045 of the current temperature of the prism-sample interface 1034 . A control line 1055 couples microcontroller 1045 to light source 1005 to enable microcontroller 1045 to control light source 1005 . Refractometer 1000 also includes a display 1060 to allow refractometer 1000 to display measurement results such as a TDS % value of the brew sample 1020 . Refractometer 1000 further includes a network interface 1065 that enables refractometer 1000 to connect via wire or wirelessly to other information handling systems 600 or the Internet 1070 . Information handling system 600 may include coffee design application 602 which uses the TDS coffee brew sample result from the refractometer 1000 as input for coffee design universal control chart display purposes. FIG. 10B is a block diagram of a brewing station 1075 that employs the disclosed coffee design system 600 and the disclosed coffee refractometer 1000 . In one embodiment, coffee brewing station 1075 includes a hot water supply 1076 and a brew basket assembly 1077 where coffee grounds mix with hot water to form a coffee drink. As the coffee drink exits brew basket 1077 , the coffee drink flows downward into a vessel 1078 that captures the brewed coffee. Vessel 1078 dispenses brewed coffee to coffee pot 1079 or other container suitable for transporting of the brewed coffee to the coffee drinker. In one embodiment, a coffee refractometer 1000 is situated in vessel 1077 so that refractometer 1000 may determine the TDS reading of a freshly brewed batch of coffee immediately after brewing. A user may take a reading of the TDS % of the coffee from the display of refractometer 1000 . The user may then manually input the TDS % reading into coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 . In response, coffee design application 602 displays the actual TDS % and extraction on the plotted brew line of a universal brew line chart such as seen in FIG. 5. In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 10B, refractometer 1000 couples to, or otherwise communicates with IHS 600 . In this manner, refractometer 1000 reads and supplies TDS % data to coffee design application 602 of IHS 600 without manual user intervention. FIG. 11A is a flowchart that depicts process steps for configuring refractometer 1000 to determine the total dissolved solids (TDS) % of a brew coffee sample. To use refractometer 1000 to measure the total dissolved solids (TDS) of coffee or any other liquid, refractometer 1000 should be both calibrated and correlated. The calibration of a refractometer is performed by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. The correlation of a refractometer is the conversion of the measured index of refraction to a scale of interest to the end user. Typically, refractometers have software that correlates to a BRIX scale. In that case the software assumes that the index of refraction of the liquid presented to the refractometer corresponds to a sugar-water solution and will output a BRIX value (equal to the % sugar by weight in solution) based upon the measured refractive index. Unfortunately, for most other liquids, such as coffee, a BRIX scale is not valid and can lead to erroneous results. To configure refractometer 1000 to measure the TDS of a brewed coffee sample, process flow commences at start block 1105 in the flowchart of FIG. 11A. A user or other entity first calibrates refractometer 1000 , as per block 1110 . The calibration of refractometer 1000 is performed in the conventional manner by measuring the index of refraction of distilled pure water at a specific temperature to ensure that the refractometer is measuring index of refraction properly. To correlate refractometer 1000 for coffee, the change in index of refraction with TDS as well as temperature is determined. The user or other entity begins correlation of refractometer 1000 , as per block 1115 . One exemplary and preferred method of determining the TDS of a coffee solution is through a dehydration method. To start the correlation procedure, different batches of coffee are brewed at different brew concentrations, while maintaining approximately the same extraction percentage from the selected batch of roasted and ground coffee beans, as per block 1120 . In other words, the user or other entity brews multiple coffee samples with different respective coffee concentrations in terms of total dissolved solids (TDS) %. The extraction percentage set during the refractometer correlation procedure is preferably the extraction percentage chosen as that of an ideal coffee solution for consumption. For purposes of example, the extraction percentage is 20%±1% although it is possible to employ other extraction percentages if desired depending on the application and user preference. For an accurate correlation procedure, it is preferable that the extraction percentage remains approximately constant because coffee grinds are composed of a mix of different materials that have different water solubility rates. The materials that have a high water solubility rate are extracted first from the coffee grinds and give the coffee a sweet flavor. Those materials that have a lower water solubility rate are extracted later in the brewing process and give the coffee a bitter flavor. Each of these different materials contained within coffee affect the index of refraction of water differently when they dissolve into it. Therefore for accurate correlation of the index of refraction of coffee to TDS, it is preferred that the extraction percentage is kept approximately constant. Note further that during the described correlation procedure it is preferred that the coffee used to make the different batches of coffee concentrations are from the same green and roast batch, and further, that they are ground to the same grade. For example, all-purpose universal Drip Grind would be derived of 8% Numbers 10/14 sieves, 65% Numbers, 27% Pan for a nominal particle size of 775 Microns (1 Micron-0.001 mm), according to the North American Coffee Industry Norms as published by Modern Process Equipment, Inc. If required, a separate correlation procedure can be conducted for each coffee bean of interest and/or different degrees of roast to determine refractometer correlation equations for these bean and roast changes. For the brew concentrations that have the same extraction percentage, it is preferred that they encompass the range of TDS expected for the consumable coffee of interest. By way of example, the brew samples can span a 0.8% to 4.0% TDS range, since 1% to 1.5% TDS represents the typical range for coffee, and 3% to 4% represents the typical range for ice coffee concentrate. For espresso, the brew concentration of 2 to 6% TDS is typically of interest with the TDS range of 4 to 5% being preferable. For espresso, given that it contains a certain percentage of undissolved solids, these solids would need to be filtered before following the dehydration procedure outlined below. Samples of each brew concentration are allowed to cool in respective sealed vial, as per block 1125 . Refractometer 1000 then measures not only the index of refraction of the sample but also the temperature of the sample. More particularly, refractometer 1000 measures the index of refraction (n s ) for each brew concentration sample across a range of temperatures as per block 1130 . For the correlation of refractometer 1000 for use outside of the brewing machine itself, a temperature range corresponding to ranges of ambient room temperatures are preferred such as 20 to 30° C. and index of refraction measurements can, for example, be taken in 1° C. increments. For a refractometer 1000 to be used to measure the index of refraction of coffee after it is brewed, the desired temperature range may be 70 to 90° C. with measurements taken every 2° C. as part of the correlation process. These correlation measurements are useful to derive the thermal dependence of the index of refraction for a specific brew concentration (i.e., a specific TDS). To determine the TDS of each of the brew concentrations, containers (for example, glass beakers) are marked and weighed (preferable to an accuracy of 1 part in 1000 or better), as per block 1135 (1 st weight reading). Portions of each brewed coffee solution are poured into individual containers (not shown) and the filled containers are reweighed (2 nd weight reading), as per block 1140 . The filled containers are then placed into a dehydration oven, as per block 1145 . After the solutions have been dehydrated or desiccated, the containers are allowed to cool in a dry environment in order to prevent any subsequent moisture absorption, as per block 1150 . The containers are then reweighed (3 rd weight reading) preferably in a dry environment, also as per block 1155 . From these three weight readings, the weight of the dissolved solids and the weight of the original solution is derived, and therefore the TDS (equal to the ratio of these two measurements) is derived. In more detail, assuming eight brewed samples of coffee of different TDS spanning 0.8 to 4.0% and ten temperature readings per sample, 80 data points are thus provided that map a three-dimensional space in TDS, temperature and refractive index. Taking TDS as the dependent variable, the TDS surface plot as a function of temperature and refractive index can be curve fit to find an equation that expresses TDS as a function of index of refraction (n) and temperature (T), (i.e. f(n, T)) as per block 1160 . Generally speaking, the curve fit of such data will be suitably fit by a linear function in index of refraction and a quadratic function of temperature. Curve fitting methods such as least squares, gradient descent, and others methods may be used. See for example, C. Daniel and F. S. Wood, Fitting Equations to Data: Computer Analysis of Multifactor Data , (John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY), 1980] The TDS formula for a fixed temperature T 0 is given by EQUATION 9 below: T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , T 0 ) = [ n ⁡ ( T 0 ) - n 0 ⁡ ( T 0 ) ] C , EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 9 where n 0 is the index of refraction at which the curve fit indicates that the TDS is zero. Note that n 0 may not necessarily correspond with the exact index of refraction measured for pure water. Assuming that the range of index of refraction and hence TDS is relatively small, such as is the case for normal coffee, the constant C can be approximated to be temperature independent. In order to adjust for temperatures, the thermal dependence of index of refraction should be taken into account. The thermal dependence of index of refraction n for a fixed TDS coffee solution is approximated by a quadratic equation in temperature T according to EQUATION 10 below. n=n 0 +α( T−T 0 )+ b ( T−T 0 ) 2 EQUATION 10 where a and b are constants derived from the curve fitting of data and the index of refraction equation is expressed such that at T=T 0 , the index of refraction is equal to n 0 . To the first order, the TDS formula that takes into account both index of refraction and temperature. for coffee is given by EQUATION 11 below. T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , T ) = [ n - n 01 - a 1 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) - b 1 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 ] C 1 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 11 where n 01 , a 1 , b 1 , and C 1 may be slightly different from the constants n 0 , a, b, and C 1 of EQUATIONS. (3) and (4) depending upon the data fit. Although EQUATION 11 may be used, for a more accurate fit of the data, particularly for higher values of TDS, it is preferred to fit the data to a full quadratic in both index of refraction n and temperature T. Although such a quadratic equation can be expressed in multiple forms that are essentially identical from the standpoint of a refractometer's electronics and/or software calculating the result, a convenient form, from the standpoint of person reading the equation is given by EQUATION 12 below. T ⁢ ⁢ D ⁢ ⁢ S ⁡ ( n , T ) = [ n - n 02 + d 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) 2 - a 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) - b 2 ⁡ ( T - T 0 ) 2 + e 2 ⁡ ( n - n 02 ) ⁢ ( T - T 0 ) ] C 2 EQUATION ⁢ ⁢ 12 since the TDS is referenced to a control temperature T 0 and the index of refraction of n 02 , which is substantially equal to the index of refraction of pure water at a temperature T 0 , but may deviate slightly depending upon the empirical fit of the data in the index-temperature parameter space of interest. A formula such as the one represented in EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into the firmware 1085 or electronics of refractometer 1000 to correlate refractometer 1000 for the liquids (e.g., coffee), concentrations, and temperatures ranges of interest. In other words, the formula of either EQUATION 11 or 12 is programmed into, installed or otherwise stored in firmware 1047 of microcontroller 1045 in refractometer 1000 , as per block 1160 , for use in determining TDS of a particular coffee brew sample from index of refraction data and temperature data that refractometer 1000 provides. Storing the TDS formula of EQUATION 11 or 12 in refractometer 1000 in this manner completes the correlation of refractometer 100 for coffee solutions of interest. In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction, but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 or 12 provide respective polynomial expressions that approximate or represent TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 11, TDS (n,T) varies linearly with index of refraction but is a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATION 11 provides a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). In EQUATION 12, TDS (n, T) varies as a quadratic function of index of refraction and also as a quadratic function of temperature. EQUATIONS 11 and 12 both provide a polynomial expression that approximates or represents TDS(n,T). It should be noted that the previously cited equations are at a specific measurement wavelength since index of refraction of all materials, including coffee, will vary with the incident wavelength. Typically this wavelength is at or near the Sodium D line of 589 nm. However, other fixed wavelengths are acceptable as well. It is also noted that different coffee varieties, different degree of roasts, different levels of extraction during brew, extraction temperatures, and other brew variables can all affect the correlation to a small degree, such that some correlations of refractive index to brew solids may result in a better fit for darker versus lighter roasts. Separate scales for each range of degree of roasts may be correlated using Agtron or similar methods for determining the degree of roast. Microcontroller 1045 uses temperature sensor 1050 to determine and/or set the temperature of both the prism 1015 and the sample 1020 . Although not shown in FIG. 10A, microcontroller 1045 may control a resistive heater and thermo-electric cooler designed to bring the sample touching the prism face to a desired temperature. Since index of refraction changes with temperature and typically in a non-linear fashion, it is desirable to compensate for temperature effects. As such, in the design of the refractometer 1000 , it is desirable that the angles of incidences of the illumination beam at the entrance face of the prism and of the reflected beam at the exit face be minimized or at least compensated thermally since refraction at these interfaces will be a function of temperature. Likewise, the focal lengths of illumination lens 1010 and collection lens 1030 are a function of wavelength and to thermally compensate the temperature-dependent optical power, the lenses are preferably mounted to a mechanical mount whose thermal expansion compensates for the changes in the optical power of the lenses. Residual thermal changes to the refractometer's ability to measure index of refraction can be compensated using a lookup table based upon the readout of the temperature sensor 1050 that adds a correction factor to the critical angle detected by the refractometer. To increase the resolution of refractometer 1000 , the operating index of refraction range can be reduced and the number of detector pixels increased. Above, as a clarifying example, a refractometer was described that worked for a range of sugar solutions of 0 to 10° BRIX using an Eastman Kodak KLI-2113 linear CCD with 2098 pixels. The resolution for this example was stated as 1.4E-5 in index of refraction and 0.0095° BRIX. If instead, an Eastman Kodak Model KLI-8023 linear CCD having a length of 8002 pixels and the BRIX scale desired were reduced to 0 to 5° BRIX, the resolution can be improved by a factor of 7.6 to 1.8E-6 in index of refraction and 0.0013° BRIX. In an alternate embodiment the linear detector is not increased in size and in fact may be reduced in array size. To achieve a higher resolution the detector is scanned along the beam produced by illumination lens 1030 in order to locate the beam intensity transition point representing the critical angle. In order to properly read out the critical angle, the scanning detector should be mounted to an encoder to that its position is known. FIG. 11B is a flowchart that describes process steps that refractometer 1000 employs to take a TDS reading for a brewed coffee sample. Process flow commences at start block 1170 . The user or other entity may calibrate refractometer 1000 , as per block 1172 . The user or other entity may place a brewed coffee sample in refractometer 1000 for the purpose of taking a TDS % reading via index of refraction measure. Refractometer 1000 takes an index of refraction reading of the brewed coffee sample, as per block 1176 , under the control of firmware 1047 . Microcontroller 1045 reads data from the light received by linear detector 1035 to determine the index of refraction of the brew coffee sample. In one embodiment, microcontroller 1045 of refractometer 1000 takes a temperature reading of the prism-sample interface 1034 , as per block 1178 . Refractometer 100 provides automatic temperature compensation for index of refraction readings of brew coffee samples, as per block 1180 . Refractometer 1000 accesses the TDS formula of EQUATION 11 or 12 that firmware 1047 or memory 1049 stores to determine the TDS % of the brewed coffee sample, as per block 1182 . Refractometer 1000 displays the determined TDS % for the brewed coffee sample on refractometer display 1060 , as per block 1184 . Conveniently, refractometer 1000 provides a TDS % reading directly to the user via display 1060 . Refractometer 1186 then sends the determined TDS % to coffee design application 602 in information handling system 600 for display on the universal brewing control chart, as per block 1186 . As discussed above, refractometer 1000 includes a network interface 1065 that couples to the Internet either by wire or wirelessly, and that may also coupled to another IHS 600 either by wire or wirelessly. In this manner, IHS 600 or another IHS on the Internet may provide updating to onboard firmware 1047 in refractometer 1000 . Refractometer 1000 may also receive updated or new scales via the Internet or IHS 600 in this manner. Refractometer 1000 may employ a wired or wireless connection to send information and data to coffee design application 602 in IHS 600 in this manner. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the various structures disclosed can be implemented in hardware or software. Moreover, the methodology represented by the blocks of the flowcharts of FIG. 9A-9B may be embodied in a computer program product, such as a media disk, media drive or other media storage such as computer program product medium 608 of FIG. 6A. In one embodiment, coffee design application 602 implements the disclosed methodology as a set of instructions (program code) in a code module which may, for example, reside in the system memory 620 of IHS 600 of FIG. 6A.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The disclosure provides methods and compositions comprising coffee beans that have been roasted, but prior to brewing are modified by the addition of one or more functional additives, non-vitamin functional additives, non-mineral functional additives, or non-vitamin and non-mineral functional additives. The disclosure also provides methods and compositions whereby ground coffee, prior to brewing or extraction, is modified by the addition of one or more functional additives, non-vitamin functional additives, non-mineral functional additives, or non-vitamin and non-mineral functional additives. The compositions provide beneficial qualities to brewed coffee, caffeinated beverages or drinks as well as health benefits to the consumer. Furthermore, the addition of functional additives to coffee bean and coffee grounds allows for the ready preparation of a healthy caffeinated beverage or drink. Such healthy beverages/drinks can be used to deliver functional additives to a subject suffering from any number of ailments. There is some evidence that coffee promotes the uptake of certain agents possibly due in part to the acidity of the coffee and/or the increased metabolism caused by caffeine. The disclosure provides compositions (including dried ground coffee, whole roasted coffee bean, and caffeinated beverages/drinks) containing functional additives at an amount from approximately 0.01% to 20% by dry weight. Coffee is a drink made by percolation, infusion, or decoction from the roasted and ground or pounded seeds of a coffee tree. Coffee is noted for its high caffeine content. Caffeine is a bitter compound C 8 H 10 N 4 O 2 found in many herbal products in coffee, tea, and kola nuts and used medicinally as a stimulant and diuretic-caffeinic. Functional additives include nutraceuticals and related herbal remedies as described more fully herein. For example, functional additives for use in the methods and compositions of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, vitamins, minerals, methyl-sulfonyl-methane (MSM), green tea and green tea extract, dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), alphalipoic acid, lutien, white willow bark, ginger, amino acids, chromium picolinate, and vanadium. Non-vitamin, non-mineral functional additives include, for example, nutraceuticals that are not considered vitamins, and nutraceuticals that are not considered minerals. For example, a non-vitamin, non-mineral functional additive includes, without limitation, amino acids, MSM, green tea and green tea extract, DMAE, alphalipoic acid, lutien preparations, white willow bark preparations, ginger preparations, colostrum, a phytosterol (e.g., beta-sitosterol), a phytostanol, passion flower preparations, ginseng preparations, sarsaparilla preparations, bayberry root preparations, echinacea powder, burdock root preparations, goldenseal root preparations, kelp preparations, hyssop preparations, milk thistle preparations, astragalus preparations, black-currant oil, cordyceps preparations, quercetin (a flavonoid), stinging nettle preparations, and tumeric preparations. Non-limiting exemplary herbals and herbal derivatives for use in the disclosure include agrimony, alfalfa, aloe vera, amaranth, angelica, anise, barberry, basil, bayberry, bee pollen, birch, bistort, blackberry, black cohosh, black walnut, blessed thistle, blue cohosh, blue vervain, boneset, borage, buchu, buckthorn, bugleweed, burdock, capsicum, cayenne, caraway, cascara sagrada, catnip, celery, centaury, chamomile, chaparral, chickweed, chicory, chinchona, cloves, coltsfoot, comfrey, cornsilk, couch grass, cramp bark, culver's root, cyani, cornflower, damiana, dandelion, devils claw, dong quai, echinacea, elecampane, ephedra, eucalyptus, evening primrose, eyebright, false unicorn, fennel, fenugreek, figwort, flaxseed, garlic, gentian, ginger, ginseng, golden seal, gotu kola, gum weed, hawthorn, hops, horehound, horseradish, horsetail, hoshouwu, hydrangea, hyssop, iceland moss, irish moss, jojoba, juniper, kelp, lady's slipper, lemon grass, licorice, lobelia, mandrake, marigold, marjoram, marshmallow, mistletoe, mullein, mustard, myrrh, nettle, oatstraw, oregon grape, papaya, parsley, passion flower, peach, pennyroyal, peppermint, periwinkle, plantain, pleurisy root, pokeweed, prickly ash, psyllium, quassia, queen of the meadow, red clover, red raspberry, redmond clay, rhubarb, rose hips, rosemary, rue, safflower, saffron, sage, St. Johnswort, sarsaparilla, sassafras, saw palmetto, scullcap, senega, senna, shepherd's purse, slippery elm, spearmint, spikenard, squawvine, stillingia, strawberry, taheebo, thyme, uva ursi, valerian, violet, watercress, white oak bark, white pine bark, wild cherry, wild lettuce, wild yam, willow, wintergreen, witch hazel, wood betony, wormwood, yarrow, yellow dock, yerba santa, yucca and combinations thereof. Herbal derivatives, as used herein, refers to herbal extracts, and substances derived from plants and plant parts, such as leaves, flowers and roots, without limitation. The functional additives in combination with coffee beans and/or coffee grounds provide a suitable method of delivery of the additive to a subject. The functional additives provided by the disclosure provide beneficial qualities to a subject that consumes a caffeinated beverage/drink obtained by extraction of the coffee bean or coffee grounds comprising the functional additive. The functionalized coffee of the disclosure can be used, for example, to improve a subject's memory, reduce joint pain and/or inflammation, reduce oxidative damage, reduce allergy symptoms, improve weight loss and/or reduce weight gain, reduce pain (e.g., pain associated with inflammation), reduce stomach upset, reduce motion sickness, improve energy and metabolism, promote smoking cessation, and improve cholesterol levels (i.e., lower cholesterol). The disclosure provides certain formulations useful to effect a subjects health, however, other formulations will be readily apparent from the description and the agents described below. In one aspect of the disclosure, kelp ( fucus vesiculosus ) preparations are added to roasted coffee and/or ground coffee. Kelp is an excellent source of minerals from the sea, including iodine, which is important for the thyroid to function properly. Studies regarding diets including kelp have determined a link to a lower breast cancer rate, and a healthier hormonal balance. Kelp is a source of vitamins A, B 1 , B 2 , C, D and E, plus amino acids. It contains algin, which will absorb toxins from the digestive tract. Bladderwrack kelp is one of the richest natural sources of approximately 30 trace elements and major minerals. It regulates the thyroid function and may be helpful in reducing obesity where it is associated with thyroid trouble. Bladderwrack kelp is also a metabolic stimulant. This is important to keep tissue in the body, healthy. Typical parts of a kelp plant that can be used in the methods and compositions of the disclosure include the dried thallus and the fresh thallus of the bladderwrack. Some thallus ends look grainy and it is here that the reproductive organs of the plant are found. The fructifications consisting of 3 cm long ovoid receptacles are found in the tips of these thalli and are either cordate or ovately flattened with grainy bladders. The bladderwrack plant is often over 1 m long, olive green when fresh, black brown when dry. The stem of the thallus is flat, repeatedly bifurcated and has a midrib along the whole length. Beside this midrib there are often scattered pores and numerous air-filled bladders. The plant is found on the North Sea Coast, the Western Baltic Coast, and on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. Bladderwrack consists of the dried thallus of Fucus vesiculosus, of Ascophyllum nodosum Le Jolis, or of both species, as well as preparations of same. Other names associated with Bladderwrack include Seawrack, Kelpware, Black-tang, Bladder Fucus, Cutweed, Fucus, Quercus marina, Sea-Wrack, and Kelp-Ware. Sources of kelp are known in the art. For example, kelp is obtained by picking fresh kelp and allowing it to dry to a stage where it can be finely ground or otherwise comminuted. The dried kelp (or part thereof) particles are dispersed or dissolved in an aqueous media to allow for spray coating of roast coffee beans or for use in fluidized bed methods. Alternatively, finely comminuted preparations are dispersed (substantially homogenously) in ground coffee preparations. The ground particle size useful in the compositions of the disclosure is about 0.1-0.5 mm, or 0.2-1 mm, but is typically about 0.3-0.7 mm. Alternatively, an extract of kelp may also be prepared by steam distillation, expression (hard pressing), or maceration. A tincture extract can be diluted as appropriate to obtain the desired concentration and/or therapeutic effect. Other methods of preparing kelp can be found in, “The Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia,” Official Compendium, Jul. 1, 1992, Pharmacopoeia Convention of the American Institute of Homeopathy (Publishers), Falls Church, Va., incorporated herein by reference. In another aspect, a coffee composition comprising roast coffee beans (or ground coffee) and phytosterol and/or phytostanol is provided. Such compositions are useful in reducing the levels of “bad” cholesterol such as low density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the blood of the subject. A good source of a phytosterol (e.g., beta-sitosterol) and phytostanol is corn fiber oil. Corn fiber oil includes phytosterols esterified with either fatty acids or phenolic acids, such as ferulic acid, an antioxidant. Furthermore corn fiber oil also contains a high level of sitostanol in the ferulic acid ester fraction. Corn fiber oil is commercially available under the trade name AMAIZING OIL. Because corn fiber oil is obtained in fluid form it is suitable for spray coating and fluidized bed treatment of roasted coffee beans and ground coffee. In another aspect of the disclosure a coffee composition comprising roast coffee beans (or ground coffee) and amino acid(s) are provided. Such compositions are useful increasing energy, promoting immune system function, improving metabolism, and modulating neural activity. Amino acids include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, theanine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. Sources of such amino acids for use in the methods and compositions of the disclosure include soy protein hydrolyzate with bound phospholipids, lecithin. In particular, L-glutamine and glycine, and branched-chain amino acids such as L-leucine, L-valine and L-isoleucine are useful in the methods and compositions of the disclosure. For example, L-glutamine is essential for the proper functioning of the brain. It is an energy source in the brain and a mediator of glutamic acid and GABA activity. L-glutamine is also vital to immune system functioning and is required for cellular replication in the immune system. However, the majority of L-glutamine is made in the muscles. Glycine, for example, is an important precursor for the production of protein, DNA, phospholipids, collagen, and creatine. It is also a precursor in the release of energy. It is necessary for the proper functioning of the central nervous system and is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Similarly, L-leucine is an essential amino acid found in proteins, is important in energy production during exercise. According to estimates, up to 90 percent of dietary L-leucine may be used for energy in existing muscles. This makes L-leucine a very limiting amino acid. Thus, it may be important to supplement the amounts of L-leucine to compensate for the loss during exercise. L-leucine has been shown to help spare muscle tissue, maintain nitrogen balance, and promote muscle growth and healing. L-valine is involved in tissue repair, nitrogen balance, and muscle metabolism. L-valine regulates how the body uses protein and plays a unique role in protein metabolism in muscles. Intense physical exercise produces a rapid excretion of nitrogen, which causes a decrease in muscle protein synthesis. L-valine limits this decrease. L-isoleucine is an integral part of muscle tissue. L-isoleucine is found in proteins and is needed for the formation of hemoglobin. It is involved in the regulation of blood sugar and is metabolized for energy in muscle tissue during exercise. Intense physical exercise produces a rapid excretion of nitrogen, which causes a decrease in muscle protein synthesis. L-isoleucine limits this decrease. L-Arginine is an amino acid suggested to be associated with improved sexual function when used as a supplement. Similarly, L-histidine has also been suggested as providing improved sexual health including more intense orgasms when used as a supplement. Amino acids can be obtained in powder or liquid form and thus are easily combined with roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds by the methods described herein. Excessive concentrations of various forms of oxygen and of free radicals can damage to living systems, including the peroxidation of membrane lipids, the hydroxylation of nucleic acid bases, and the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups and of other sensitive moieties in proteins. If uncontrolled, mutations and cellular death result. As mentioned above, the coffee compositions of the disclosure can assist in reducing oxidative damage by free radicals. Free radicals, particularly free radicals derived from molecular oxygen, have been associated with a number of diseases and disorders (Zimmermen J. J. (1991) Chest 100: 189S). Some of the disease and disorders associated with oxygen free radicals include pulmonary oxygen toxicity, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis syndrome, and a variety of ischemia-reperfusion syndromes, including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiopulmonary bypass, organ transplantation, necrotizing enterocolitis, acute renal tubular necrosis, and other disease. Many free radical reactions are highly damaging to cellular components; they crosslink proteins, mutagenize DNA, and peroxidize lipids. Once formed, free radicals can interact to produce other free radicals and non-radical oxidants such as singlet oxygen and peroxides. Degradation of some of the products of free radical reactions can also generate potentially damaging chemical species. Green tea leaf extract has been renowned as the herbal healer for over 4000 years. It is one of the best sources of polyphenols—naturally occurring plant chemicals that have amazing antioxidant properties. For example, green tea catechins neutralize dietary carcinogens such as nitrosamine and aflatoxin. Green tea contains volatile oils, vitamins, and minerals, but the active constituents are polyphenols, particularly the catechins called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The polyphenols are believed to be responsible for most of green tea's roles in promoting good health. Research demonstrates that green tea guards against cardiovascular disease in many ways. Green tea lowers total cholesterol levels and improves the cholesterol profile (the ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol), reduces platelet aggregation, and lowers blood pressure. The polyphenols in green tea have also been shown to lessen the risk of cancers of several sites, stimulates the production of several immune system cells, and have anti-bacterial properties even against the bacteria that cause dental plaque. Green tea treatment appears to reduce heart disease risk factors. Green Tree extracts can be added in a powdered form to roasted coffee beans and/or ground coffee in sufficient quantity to have beneficial health qualities without significantly affecting the taste, aroma, and other qualities of the coffee. The type of coffee used can be either caffeinated or de-caffeinated. For example, in one aspect the green tea extract (95% pure) comprises about 5.4% by weight of a ground coffee composition (e.g., 2 grams green tea extract in 37 gram bag of composition). Green tea extract is a natural compound containing tea polyphenols. Green tea is steamed, baked or pan heated to prevent oxidation and thus, the leaves remain green. Method of Green Tea Extract Formulation Use part Green Tea Leaf Solvent used in Extraction/type Ethyl Acetate and Hydro-alcohol extraction Method of Manufacturing Water/Hydro-alcohol/Ethyl Acetate Extraction and Spray dry Method of Analysis UV-VIS & HPLC Other antioxidant agents that can be used in formulations with coffee beans and/or ground coffee include, for example, glutathione-like substances as well as NAD and derivatives thereof (e.g., NADH). NAD and NAD derivatives include quinolinic acid; quinolinic acid ribonucleotide; nicotinamide; nicotinic acid; nicotinic acid ribonucleotide; nicotinic acid ribonucleotide, reduced form; nicotinamide ribonucleotide; nicotinamide ribonucleotide, reduced form; nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide; nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, reduced form; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD); nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form (NADH); and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. All of these chemicals are commercially available or are generally known. Typically the NAD related molecule is nicotinamide or nicotinic acid, more typically nicotinamide. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also included and can be derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter salts well known in the art and include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium magnesium, ammonium, tetralkylammonium and the like. In another aspect, the disclosure provides a roast coffee bean and/or ground coffee composition comprising chromium picolinate. This composition finds use in reducing weight gain and/or promoting weight loss, and finds beneficial use in affecting diabetes. Chromium picolinate helps control blood sugar and aids in insulin production. Vanadium has some properties similar to that of chromium. The disclosure provides a composition comprising coffee beans or ground coffee (i.e., post roasting of the coffee beans) prior to brewing combined with one or more functional food additives. In one aspect the functional food additives are vanadium and/or chromium picolinate. Chromium is a nutritionally essential trace element. The necessity of chromium in the diet was established in 1959 by Schwartz, as cited in Present Knowledge in Nutrition, page 571, fifth edition (1984, the Nutrition Foundation, Washington, D.C.). Chromium depletion is characterized by a disruption in glucose, lipid and protein metabolism and by a shortened lifespan. Chromium is essential for optimal insulin activity in all known insulin-dependent systems (Boyle et al., Southern Med. J. 70:1449-1453, 1977). Insufficient dietary chromium has been linked to both mature-onset diabetes and to cardiovascular disease. The principle energy sources for the body are glucose and fatty acids. Chromium depletion results in biologically ineffective insulin and compromised glucose metabolism. Under these conditions, the body must rely primarily on lipid metabolism to meet its energy requirements, resulting in the production of excessive amounts of acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies. Some of the documented acetyl-CoA is converted to increased cholesterol biosynthesis, resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized in large part by glycosuria, hypercholesterolemia, and often ketoacidosis. The accelerated atherosclerotic process seen in diabetics is associated with hypercholesterolemia. Dietary supplementation of chromium to normal individuals has been reported to lead to improvements in glucose tolerance, serum lipid concentrations, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin and insulin binding (Anderson, Clin. Psychol. Biochem. 4:31-41, 1986). Supplemental chromium in the trivalent form, e.g. chromic chloride, is associated with improvements of risk factors associated with adult-onset (Type II) diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Chromium functions as a cofactor for insulin. It binds to the insulin receptor and potentiates many of its functions. These functions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. (Present Knowledge in Nutrition, supra, at p. 573-577). The introduction of inorganic chromium compounds into individuals is not particularly beneficial. Chromium must be converted endogenously into an organic complex or must be consumed as a biologically active molecule. Only about 0.5% of ingested inorganic chromium is assimilated into the body (Recommended Daily Allowances, Ninth Revised Edition, The National Academy of Sciences, page 160, 1980). Only 1-2% of most organic compounds are assimilated into the body. U.S. Pat. No. Re. 33,988 discloses that when selected essential metals, including chromium, are administered to mammals as exogenously synthesized coordination complexes of picolinic acid, they are directly available for absorption without competition from other metals. Nicotinic acid and picolinic acid form coordination complexes with monovalent, divalent and trivalent metal ions and facilitate the absorption of these metals by transporting them across intestinal cells and into the bloodstream. Chromium absorption in rats following oral administration of CrCl 3 was facilitated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin and indomethacin (Davis et al., J. Nutrition Res. 15:202-210, 1995; Kamath et al., J. Nutrition 127:478-482, 1997). These drugs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase which converts arachidonic acid to various prostaglandins, resulting in inhibition of intestinal mucus formation and lowering of intestinal pH which facilitates chromium absorption. Chromium picolinate is typically provided in a tablet, capsule or pill to be taken with meals. However, it will be recognized that the administration of tablets and pills is more difficult than drinking a beverage. Furthermore, coffee (caffeic acid) is an acidic compound that when brewed and ingested reduces the pH of the stomach and the intestine thereby increasing chromium uptake. The combination of chromium picolinate and related compounds with a coffee composition for brewing and in caffeinated beverages/drinks facilitate absorption of chromium and other endogenous or exogenous metals, for use in lowering blood glucose levels, serum lipid levels and increasing lean body mass. In yet another aspect, the disclosure provides roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds and White Willow bark preparations. A coffee bean and/or coffee ground preparation comprising White Willow bark finds use in treating inflammation and aches and pains (e.g., associated with arthritis). White willow bark (a member of the Sialix sp.), also known as natural aspirin, has been used in the treatment of aches and pains. An active ingredient in the white willow bark is salicin, which is converted by the body to acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin. Although white willow bark is believed to act in a manner similar to aspirin by blocking prostaglandin synthesis, it is efficacious at a lower blood level than aspirin. Recent studies have reported a peak plasma level of 10 mM/L following administration of 1,360 mg extract containing 240 mg salicin. This plasma level is below that of 130 mM/L that occurs following the administration of 500 mg aspirin, a dose common for analgesic and antipyretic activity (see, Schmid et al. Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 57(5):387-91, 2001). In addition, sodium salicylates may act by inhibiting the function of neutrophils, the most abundant cell associated with inflammation. Moreover, salicylates that lack an acetyl group, such as those present in white willow bark, do not inhibit aggregation of platelets at physiologically relevant concentrations (see, Krivoy et al., Planta Med. 67(3):209-12, 2001). White Willow Bark may be dried and ground. The ground bark may then be dispersed or dissolved in a solvent and used to spray coffee beans or used in a fluidized bed system. Alternatively, the dried and ground bark preparation may be combined with ground coffee beans and mixed to a substantially homogenous mixture. Typically the formulation is adjusted to contain 15% salicin. White willow bark is typically administered at a dose of up to 400 mg/day, with typical doses ranging from 60-300 mg of salicin/day. A standard recommended starting dose is from 60-120 mg/day. When thoroughly mixed and dispersed and/or dissolved in the aqueous medium of the disclosure the white willow bark will commonly be present at a concentration of about 0.001-2.0% (e.g., about 0.05%), but is typically about 0.01-0.35% by weight (e.g., about 0.07%). In yet another aspect, the disclosure provides roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds and methyl-sulfonyl-methane (MSM) preparations. A coffee bean and/or coffee ground preparation comprising MSM finds use in treating aches and pains associated with joint damage (e.g., associated with arthritis). Methyl-sulfonyl-methane (MSM) or dimethyl sulfone can also be included in the methods and compositions of the disclosure. Methyl-sulfonyl-methane is essentially DMSO with an extra oxygen molecule. In the body, MSM gives up its sulfur to form methionine and cysteine for connective tissue. It is this aspect of the molecule that lends itself to treating or regenerating cartilage and other connective tissue ailments associated with, for example, inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. MSM is anti-inflammatory and analgesic and useful for muscle soreness and cramps, prevents cartilage degeneration and improves joint flexibility. The therapeutic dosage range for MSM is 2-10 grams orally per day. The recommended topical dosage range is 1-5 grams. In the disclosure, MSM is present in the coffee compositions at an amount from 0.01-0.5% of the total weight of the composition (e.g., 0.1% by weight). MSM is a compound normally found in many foods including cow's milk, meat, fruits, and vegetables. For example, in one aspect MSM comprises about 12.1% by weight of a ground coffee composition (e.g., 4.5 grams MSM in 37 gram bag of composition). In another embodiment, the disclosure provides roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds and glucosamine preparations. A coffee bean and/or coffee ground preparation comprising glucosamine finds use in treating inflammation and aches and pains (e.g., associated with arthritis). Glucosamine, a natural sugar synthesized by the body and present in some foods, is a component glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans, two essential components of cartilage. Glycosamino-glycans and proteoglycans are essential in maintaining the cushion properties of cartilage. If the body does not make sufficient amounts of these carbohydrates, the cartilage degenerates, cracks and wears away resulting in a loss of cushioning between the bones. Accordingly, the methods and compositions of the disclosure may include such carbohydrate molecules in order to assist in the maintenance and/or regeneration of cartilage. Glucosamine is typically administered at a dose of up to 3,000 mg/day, with a typical dose ranging from 1,000-2,000 mg/day. The disclosure provides compositions and methods that utilize a dose of about 0.01-0.9% glucosamine by weight of the composition. Similarly, chondroitin sulfate, another carbohydrate that is essential to the maintenance of cartilage, tendons, and other connective tissues, has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of arthritis. Evidence suggests that chondroitin may inhibit the enzymes that break down cartilage in joints, and/or increase the amount of hyaluronic acid in the joints (a protective fluid that keeps joints lubricated). The disclosure provides compositions and methods that utilize about 0.01-0.9% chondroitin sulfate by weight of the composition. In another aspect of the disclosure the anti-inflammatory activity of Tumeric ( Curcuma longa ) may reduce swelling in arthritic joints. Tumeric works by inhibiting platelet aggregation and cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes that trigger the formation of inflammatory mediators (e.g., prostaglandins). Dosage should not exceed 100 mg/day dry, with lower doses if other blood thinning agents are being taken. For example, Tumeric would be present in a coffee composition of the disclosure at about 0.01-0.5% by weight. As with many herbs, extracts of dried Tumeric may be prepared. Dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) can be prepared in the roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds compositions of the disclosure. A coffee bean and/or coffee ground preparation comprising DMAE finds use in treating certain neurological disorders as well as stimulating memory and brain activity. Because it steps up production of brain chemicals essential for short-term memory, concentration, and learning capacity, DMAE may aid in the treatment of ADHD and other disorders affecting the brain and central nervous system. DMAE is sometimes referred to as a “cholinergic” because it is thought to increase levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, one of the chemicals in the brain that enhances mental powers. “Cholinergic” drugs, such as tacrine (Cognex), are used to treat the dementia of Alzheimer's disease. Cholinergic drugs are also sometimes prescribed to stabilize the debilitating movements brought on by tardive dyskinesia, a side effect of the antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia, and Huntington's chorea, an inherited condition that also causes memory loss. Specifically, DMAE may help to relieve the inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although ADHD has long been recognized as a cause of disruptive behavior and learning difficulties in school-age children, doctors are increasingly coming to recognize it as a cause of problems in adults as well. DMAE may also slow the progressive dementia of Alzheimer's disease. The severe and progressive memory loss of Alzheimer's disease is due in part to the loss of brain cells that produce acetylcholine, a key chemical messenger for enhancing communication between brain cells. Acetylcholine is also essential for learning and memory. In fact, it's for these reasons that doctors routinely prescribe drugs that boost levels of acetylcholine, such as tacrine (Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), rivasatigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl). In animal studies, DMAE supplements have led to significant improvements in short-term memory, possibly due to cholinergic effects. A number of small studies indicate that DMAE may have similar benefits for people with Alzheimer's. The possible memory-boosting effects of DMAE may help with the ordinary memory lapses that occur with normal aging. Many nutritionally oriented physicians prescribe DMAE along with another memory enhancer, the dietary supplement phosphatidylcholine. Some people who have tried DMAE report better memory (especially short-term memory), as well as improved concentration, focus, mental clarity, and sleep. In one aspect of the disclosure, DMAE comprises about 0.81% by weight of a ground coffee composition (e.g., 300 mg DMAE in 37 gram bag of composition). The disclosure also provides roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds and ginger preparations. A coffee bean and/or coffee ground preparation comprising ginger finds use in treating stomach upset (e.g., associated with morning sickness) and motion sickness. European studies looking at ginger's potential to reduce motion sickness reported positive results. Ginger is believe to reduce nausea by increasing digestive fluids and absorbing and neutralizing toxins and stomach acid. Ginger has also been shown to increase bile secretion as well as the action and tone of the bowel. There is some evidence that suggest that ginger may also reduce the “stickiness” of blood platelets and may thereby reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. Ginger is typically prepared from and used as a fresh root, dried root, tincture and the like. Milk thistle extract can also be used in the compositions of the disclosure. Compositions comprising coffee beans and/or ground coffee and milk thistle extract are useful in promoting liver function and blood detoxification. Milk thistle extract contains plant chemicals called silymarin that are known for protecting the liver. Milk thistle has been identified as a source of such ingredients as silymarin, silybinin, isosilybinin, and silychristin). These agents are typically found in the seeds of milk thistle plants. Silymarin, for example, is known to protect the liver by strengthening the outer membranes of liver cells, which prevents toxins from entering the cells. Silymarin also stimulates protein synthesis in the liver, which helps to regenerate and repair the liver. Milk thistle compounds are also strong antioxidants and have bee shown to reduce damage to liver cells cause by repeated use of common prescription drugs and pollutants. In yet another aspect, a coffee bean preparation and/or coffee ground preparation can comprise alpha-lipoic acid (ALA). Such compositions find use as antioxidants. ALA plays a role in the mitochondria of cells. ALA acts as an antioxidant, however, only when there is an excess of ALA and when it is in a free state in the cells. Typically there is little free ALA circulating in the body, unless a subject consumes supplements comprising ALA. ALA can play a role in protecting the mitochondria and the genetic material, DNA as a result of aging and oxidative damage. ALA also helps the utilization of vitamins C and E. ALA is commercially available. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee ground combined with Passion Flower extract. Passion Flower ( Passiflora incarnata ) contains alkaloids and flavonoids which help induce sleep and relaxation. Passion flower has also been used to treat menstrual cramps. The medicinal parts of the plant are the leaves, stems, flowers and fruit. Passion Flower is a dry powdered herb deriving from Passiflora incarnate. Passion Flower has been traditionally used for it mild sedative effects; further, it advantageously has a pleasant taste and is surprisingly gentle. The plant contains a group of indole alkaloids and several flavonoids which are believed responsible for its sedative and analgesic effects. Both dried leaves and stems have been used to induce sleep, although the concentration of Passion Flower in the present dietary supplement is not enough to cause drowsiness. The disclosure also provide coffee bean preparations and/or coffee grounds comprising ginseng. Ginseng, in which the applicable part is the root, contains ginsenosides. Ginsenosides reportedly lower blood pressure; act as an anti-hemolytic, anti-pyretic, anti-psychotic, CNS depressant and ulcer protective activity; and increase GI mobility and decreases islet insulin concentrations. When used orally, ginseng reduces post-pranial blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetics. Ginseng has also been found to lower blood glucose levels and to enhance the efficacy of vitamins C, B and E. Ginseng also acts as an adaptogen, a substance that can act to strengthen the body and increase general resistance. Ginseng has been found to protect the body and nervous system from stress, stimulate and increase metabolic function, increase physical and mental efficiency, lower blood pressure & glucose levels when they are high, and raise them (blood pressure & glucose levels) when they are low, increase gastrointestinal movement and tone, increase iron metabolism, and cause changes in nucleic acid (RNA) biosynthesis. In geriatric use, Ginseng has been proven beneficial in restoring mental abilities. For example, animal studies have demonstrated Ginseng's ability to help the learning process. The disclosure provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee ground combined with various starch blockers. Starch blockers are useful in controlling obesity by reducing the amount of carbohydrates ingested. Starch blockers consist of amylase inhibitors. In one aspect, such amylase inhibitors are made from a protein in white kidney bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ). The blockers prevent the breakdown of starch molecules, which are then passed out in the feces. In yet another aspect, the disclosure provide a coffee composition useful in controlling cortisol. Cortisol is known as a hormone which, in excess, creates stress. It is also sometimes associated with obesity (because cortisol increases appetite and stimulates adipose tissue to store fat), diabetes (because cortisol induces insulin resistance and elevates blood sugar), osteoporosis (because cortisol increases osteoclastic bone resorption and accelerates bone loss), muscle loss (because cortisol blocks the anabolic effects of testosterone and growth hormone, while also increasing protein turnover and muscle breakdown), suppressed immune system (because while short-term cortisol exposure can temporarily stimulate immune function, longer term chronic cortisol exposure accelerates immune cell death and increases risk of infections. Cortisol is a steroid hormone made in the adrenal glands. It is essential at certain levels for proper metabolic health, but harmful if too high or to low. Among its important functions in the body include roles in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function as well as regulation of body's use of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Cortisol secretion increases in response to any stress in the body, whether physical or psychological. When cortisol is secreted, it causes a breakdown of muscle protein, leading to the release of amino acids into the bloodstream. These amino acids are then used by the liver to synthesize glucose for energy, in a process called gluconeogenesis. At the same time the other tissues of the body decrease their use of glucose as fuel. Cortisol also leads to the release of so-called fatty acids, an energy source from fat cells, for use by the muscles. Taken together, these energy-directing processes prepare the individual to cope with stressors and ensure that the brain receives adequate energy sources. In one aspect, a coffee composition comprising agents that can control cortisol are provided. Substance documented to control cortisol effects include, for example, phospholipids, Beta-sitosterol, Magnolia bark, and L-Theanine. L-theanine, for example, is a relaxant that increases alpha-waves producing mental and physical relations decreasing stress and anxiety, without inducing drowsiness The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee ground combined with Sarsaparilla extract. Sarsaparilla is a plant of the liliaceous family which includes many varieties, depending on their origin. Representative varieties or species of which the extract can be used in the composition of the present disclosure include: Smilax aspera, Smilax officinalis, Smilax regilii, Smilax glaberrina, Smilax medica, Smilax aristolochiaefolia, Smilax papyraceae, Smilax febrifuga, Smilax ornata, Smilax saluberina and Smilax china. The sarsaparilla extract used in the composition of the disclosure can be obtained essentially from the roots of the plant. These extracts are characterized by the presence of saponins, the sapogenins of which have a steroidic structure. The sarsaparilla extract can be obtained in accordance with various processes and, principally, by maceration, digestion, decoction, infusion or lixiviation. All these extraction methods are well known and are described in detail in the book: “L'Officine”, by Dorvault, Edition Vigot, 1978, pp. 569-573. The extracts of sarsaparilla obtained by these extraction processes can be provided in the form of a liquid extract, a dry extract or an extract of soft consistency. Of the various extraction processes, one process, in accordance with the disclosure is either an aqueous extraction at the boiling point of the solvent (e.g. water), or lixiviation, using (1) at least one lower aliphatic alcohol having 1-3 carbon atoms such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol; or (2) a mixture of water and ethyl acetate or acetone. This type extraction can be carried out at ambient temperature. Particularly, there can be used the process described in French Pat. No. 1,520,375. This process comprises treating the roots of sarsaparilla ground in the presence of methyl, ethyl or isopropyl alcohol, and concentrating the resulting product under a vacuum until it has a pasty consistency. The extract obtained is then taken up in boiling water, which is then cooled and the insoluble portion filtered off. The fraction soluble in water can then be concentrated so as to provide liquid or dry extracts or it can optionally be treated again so as to yield extracts which are more pure or which are more enriched in active substances. The soluble fraction can, in effect, be treated with ammonium sulfate and the resulting precipitate can be extracted with methanol or ethanol. After evaporation, a dry extract in the form of a powder is obtained which represents about, on a weight basis, from 8 to 10% of the total weight of the initially treated roots. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee ground combined with bayberry extract. Bayberry figured as an important remedy to treat a condition that represented the physical symptoms of coldness in the body. Bayberry ( Myrica cerifera, Myricaceae; also known as Candleberry, Wax Myrtle, Waxberry) has a number of similar species that can be used in the methods and compositions of the disclosure. The similar species include M. californica, Myrica gale, Myrica ocuba, and Myrica jalapensis. Bayberry contains a variety of flavonoids among which myricitrin, as well as tannins (upwards of 3.9% in the bark), terpenoids (myricadiol, taraxerol, taxaxerone), wax (containing palmitic, myristic and lauric acid esters), gums, resins, albumen and starch are the most characterized. Bayberry bark is both astringent and stimulant, highly valued in debilitated and catarrhal conditions of the mucous membranes. In small drop doses Bayberry tincture is said to have a stimulant effect upon the autonomic nervous system, “aiding the processes of digestion, blood making, and nutrition,” indicated in chronic gastritis, chronic diarrhea, mucus colitis and dysentery. In larger doses Bayberry has a decided stimulant effect upon gastric and respiratory function, best used to combat nascent fevers, colds, sore throats, flus and infectious disease. Echinacea powder can also be combined with coffee beans and/or coffee grounds. There are three species of echinacea— E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida. Preparations are made from the above-ground herb (aerial) and/or root portions depending upon the species used. Echinacea sp. are good sources of phenols. For example, cichoric and caftaric acids are phenols found within both the aerial and root portions of E. purpurea, while echinacoside is a phenol found in higher levels specifically within E. angustifolia and E. pallida roots. Other constituents that may be important include alkamides and polysaccharides. The compositions of the disclosure comprising echinacea find use as immune stimulant; use in bacterial & viral infections, glandular infection, yeast infection, herpes; shortens duration of colds and flu; boost lymphatic cleansing of blood; skin eruptions; and as an anti-inflammatory for arthritis. In yet another aspect, Black Cohosh preparations can be combined with roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds. Black Cohosh has been shown in recent European studies to have several actions on the various symptoms associated with menopause. Certain complex chemicals, especially triterpenes and flavonoids, are believed to be the active constituents. Some of them act on the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain, to suppress the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH). High levels of LH in the blood are often associated with menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, heart palpitations, and drying and thinning of the vagina. In contrast to standard hormonal therapy with estrogens and progestins, however, Black Cohosh does not seem to affect levels of two other pituitary hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin. In other words, the action is more selective than with normal hormonal therapy. That's good, because it tends to lessen side effects. Other constituents in Black Cohosh bind to estrogen receptors, producing a weak estriol-like effect. Estriol, unlike its more potent cousin estradiol, is not associated with increased risk of breast, ovarian or endometrial cancers. Still other constituents in this plant seem to promote mild relaxation. Black Cohosh also has a tonic action on the heart and circulation. It has been experimentally proven to reduce hypertension. The plant exhibits a variety of other physiological properties that are only vaguely related to each other. In another aspect, Cayenne preparations can be combined with roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds. Cayenne has effects on circulation, the heart, the stomach, and other systems of the body. It is generally considered a carminative (expelling gas from the stomach & intestines) and a stimulant. The stimulant property, however, is prevalent such that increased tonus of nerves and glands is a major end result of its action. It stimulates the vital organs to greater activity levels, and promotes cardiovascular efficiency, while lowering overall blood pressure. Additionally, Cayenne acts directly as a diaphoretic, stimulating excretion of wastes in the sweat. By increasing the circulation of blood to peripheral tissues, Cayenne helps ensure that nutrients are effectively delivered to inflamed and infected areas. Cayenne also helps regulate cholesterol and lipid levels. The disclosure provides garlic preparations combined with roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds. Garlic has diaphoretic, diuretic, expectorant, and stimulant properties. Garlic is available in powder and ground preparations. The disclosure provides goldenseal preparations combined with roast coffee beans and/or coffee grounds. Goldenseal, a member of the family Ranunculaceae. Goldenseal extract, derived from the rhizome and roots of plant. The coffee and goldenseal compositions of the disclosure find use as a remedy for various gastric and genitourinary disorders. Goldenseal's benefits may be attributed to its alkaloids, especially hydrastine and berberine. These alkaloids are strongly astringent and help reduce inflammation of mucous membranes. Hydrastine has also been reported to lower blood pressure and stimulate peristalsis as well as relieving cough. Also provided are coffee compositions (e.g., ground coffee or coffee beans) comprising Hawthorne berry. This coffee compositions is useful in weight regulation and in some instances may comprise chromium picolinate. Hawthorne berry helps to offset the increased demands made on the heart by the condition of being overweight. It also helps recondition and tone-up the heart muscle while reducing body weight, especially if the weight reduction plan includes some form of routine exercise (as it should). In this case, it is very important that the heart be able to supply sufficient oxygen to the tissues in order to maintain good health. Hawthorne berries have been shown to have an oxygen-saving effect on the heart muscle. Hawthorne also exhibits a very strong vasodilatory action, and it lowers peripheral resistance to blood flow. After several hours of food abstinence, this herb produces a significant decrease in free fatty acids and in lactic acid within the body. These findings indicate that Hawthorne has an anabolic (building up) effect on the metabolic process, and helps reduce coronary stress induced by being overweight. Certain compositions of the disclosure are also useful in eye care. The disclosure provides compositions comprising coffee beans and/or coffee grounds in combination with lutein. In some aspects the composition also includes ALA. Lutein is a yellow carotenoid pigment produced by plants, and found in macula, the small, central area covering the retina. Lutein is believed to protect the eye and optic nerves, as a filter and as an anti-oxidant. Lutein belongs to xanthophylls, a subgroup in the carotene family of plant secondary metabolism products, which consist of over 600 phytochemicals derived from C5 isoprene, known as the carotenoid pigments. These pigments give yellow, green or orange coloration to vegetables and fruits and they are precursors for Vitamin A. Lutein is naturally found in egg yolk, and several plants including some flowers, red peppers, collard greens, kale, leeks, peas, romain lettuce, mustard and spinach. In the eye, lutein is the primary carotenoid present in the central area of the retina, called macula. Lutein is thought to act as a filter to protect the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells (cone cells) in macula from potentially damaging forms of light and light-originated free radical damages. Dietary lutein is considered an essential micronutrient for normal vision. Lutein supplementation may be beneficial for the management of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older people. Studies show that people who eat more lutein-containing foods appear to be less likely to develop macular degeneration. In yet another aspect, the disclosure provides coffee preparations (e.g., coffee beans and/or coffee grounds) combined with Burdock Root. Burdock root is one of the foremost cleansing herbs, providing nourishing support for the blood, the liver, and the natural defense system. Burdock root preparations are rich in Vitamins B 1 , B 6 , B 12 , and E, plus manganese, copper, iron, zinc, sulfur, and more. Burdock is also known by the names Bardane, Clotburr, Beggars Buttons, Gypsy Rhubarb, Gobo, and Burr. Medicinally, Burdock Root has been used both internally and externally for eczema and psoriasis, as well as to treat painful joints and as a diuretic. In traditional Chinese medicine, Burdock Root, in combination with other herbs, is used to treat sore throats, tonsillitis, colds, and even measles. The herb contains polyacetylenes that have both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. In yet another aspect, the disclosure provides coffee preparations (e.g., coffee beans and/or coffee grounds) comprising hyssop preparations. Hyssop, a perennial, is a native of the south of Europe, growing in meadows and moist grounds. The plant is inodorous, but has a bitter, nauseous, somewhat acrid taste, which earns it the name of Hedge Hyssop. Its active constituent is the bitter crystalline glucoside Gratiolin and a reddish, amorphous, bitter principle, Gratiosolin, likewise a glucoside. Compositions comprising hyssop and coffee are useful as diuretics. Such a composition may also be used for the relief of dropsy, scrofula, chronic affections of the liver, jaundice, and enlargement of the spleen, and as a worm dispeller. Hyssop is typically prepared from the root as a powder. In another aspect, the disclosure provides coffee preparations (e.g., coffee beans and/or coffee grounds) comprising colostrum (e.g., non-human colostrum). Colostrum is the pre-milk fluid produced from a female's mammary glands during the first few days after birth. Bovine colostrum is derived from cows, however other non-human animals can be used as sources of colostrum including goats, sheep and the like. Colostrum is a rich source of antibodies, growth factors and nutrients for the suckling neonate and may provide passive immunity to the newborn against various infectious microorganisms, particularly those that affect the gastrointestinal tract. It may also have other health benefits. The protein content of bovine colostrum is three to four times higher than it is in regular cow's milk. The greater part of this protein is comprised of whey proteins. Immunoglobulins, mainly IgG, make up about 75% of the whey proteins. Other substances found in bovine colostrum include casein, lactoferrin, alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, and the growth factors insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). In addition, bovine colostrum contains vitamins, minerals, lipids and lactose. Bovine colostrum may also contain colostrinin, also known as proline-rich polypeptide (PRP), a substance found in ovine (sheep) colostrum. Bovine colostrum is commercially available in several forms. Bovine colostrum prepared by microfiltration is mainly composed of whey proteins and their associated immunoglobulins and the growth factors IGF-1, IGF-2, TGFβ and EGF. Substances such as lactose, fats, casein and lactalbumin are significantly reduced in microfiltered bovine colostrum. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum is rich in immunoglobulins of the IgG type, which may be protective against such infectious microorganisms as Cryptosporidium parvum (a major cause of AIDS-associated diarrhea), diarrheogenic Escherichia coli strains, Shigella flexneri, Clostridium difficile, and rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in young children. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum is prepared from cows previously immunized with specific antigens. Hyperimmune bovine colostrum IgG concentrate is an orphan drug for the treatment of diarrhea in AIDS patients caused by infection with Cryptosporidium parvum. In yet another embodiment, a coffee composition comprising roast coffee beans and/or ground coffee combined with Kava is provided. Kava refers to the plant and more typically the root of a shrub called the pepper plant, Piper methysticum, found in Polynesia, Melanesia, and Micronesia. The root is typically ground to a powder, and it has a brownish color. The brownish powder is then mixed with coffee grounds or may be mixed with water and used to spray coated or used in a fluidized bed process for use with coffee bean and/or coffee grounds. Kava is useful as a calming and stimulating intoxicant. Taken in large quantities it produces a euphoric state, which is why it has long been considered an aphrodisiac. Narcotic Experience in the Pacific Islands and among the Aborigines in Australia has shown that if taken to excess kava has a narcotic effect, inducing stupor. Kava has an antiseptic action and in the past it was used specifically to treat venereal disease, especially gonorrhea. Kava is useful as a urinary antiseptic, helping to counter urinary infections and to settle an irritable bladder. Kava is also useful as a remedy for chronic pain, helping to reduce sensitivity and to relax muscles that are tensed in response to pain. Accordingly, Kava compositions of the disclosure can be used in arthritic subjects and for anxiousness. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee grounds combined with Astragalus extract. Astragalus boosts the immune system. Coffee compositions of the disclosure comprising astragalus can be used for conditions that can benefit from improved immune function, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), burns and abscesses, chronic colds and flu, fatigue, night sweats, and loss of appetite. It's also taken to counter the toxic effects of cancer treatment and to relieve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee grounds combined with Black Currant Oil. Black Currant Oil is a rich source of gamma linolenic acid along with other important polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fatty acids are involved in many body functions, such as maintaining body temperature, insulating nerves, cushioning and protecting tissues and creating energy. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee grounds combined with cordyceps extract or preparations. Cordyceps sinensis in its sexual stage is the primary form used. However, more than ten related species (in sexual and asexual stages) as well as artificially cultured mycelium are today used as substitutes in commercial preparations. C. sinensis, C. ophioglossoides, C. capita, and C. militaris are the most common species in commerce. Cordyceps has been used in connection with kidney disease and immune function. Cordyceps contains a wide variety of potentially important constituents, including polysaccharides, ophiocordin (an antibiotic compound), cordycepin, cordypyridones, nucleosides, bioxanthracenes, sterols, alkenoic acids, and exo-polymers. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee grounds combined with quercetin. Quercetin belongs to a class of water-soluble plant pigments called flavonoids. Quercetin acts as an antihistamine and has anti-inflammatory properties. As an antioxidant, it protects LDL cholesterol (the “bad” cholesterol) from becoming damaged. A variety of evidence indicates that quercetin possesses potent antioxidant properties. Cardiologists believe that damage to LDL cholesterol is an underlying cause of heart disease. Quercetin blocks an enzyme that leads to accumulation of sorbitol, which has been linked to nerve, eye, and kidney damage in those with diabetes. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee grounds combined with stinging nettle extracts. Extracts of the stinging nettle roots have been used in Germany for the therapy of prostate disorders and rheumatoid arthritis. Extracts from stinging nettle contain a number of substances including caffeic acid, malic acid, polysaccharides and probably many other compounds including lectins, lignans, and phytosterols. Stinging nettle has been shown to be anti-inflammatory by preventing the body from making inflammatory chemicals known as prostaglandins. Stinging Nettle has a valuable role to play in treating hay fever and prostate symptoms, as well as in easing the pain and inflammation of gout. Stinging nettle extract is available in powders, tinctures and aqueous extracts. The disclosure also provides a coffee composition comprising coffee beans and/or coffee grounds combined with L-Theanine. L-Theanine, is a unique free form acid found only in the tea plant and in the mushrooms Xeroconus badius and certain species of genus Camellia, C. japonica and C. sasanqua. L-theanine is a relaxant that increases alpha-waves producing mental and physical relations decreasing stress and anxiety, without inducing drowsiness. In some embodiments, however, non-vitamin or non-mineral functional additives are used. By non-vitamin functional additives is meant that vitamins are not separately added. For example, certain function additives including certain herbal preparations inherently include certain vitamins. By non-vitamin functional additives is meant that substantially purified vitamin preparations (e.g., substantially pure vitamin C, vitamin B, vitamin E and the like) are not separately added to a coffee composition of the disclosure. Substantially purified vitamin preparations are available commercially as Vitamin C tablets and the like. By non-mineral functional additives is meant that minerals are not separately added. For example, certain function additives including certain herbal preparations inherently include certain minerals. By non-mineral functional additives is meant that substantially purified mineral preparations (e.g., substantially pure iron, calcium and the like) are not separately added to a coffee composition of the disclosure. Substantially purified mineral preparations are available commercially. Non-limiting examples of vitamins and minerals, include niacin, thiamin, folic acid, pantothenic acid, biotin, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B 2 , vitamin B 3 , vitamin B 6 , vitamin B 12 , vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, iron, zinc, copper, calcium, phosphorous, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, and fluoride. A typical mineral for use is calcium. Typically at least one vitamin is selected from vitamin C, vitamin B 6 , vitamin B 12 , vitamin E, pantothenic acid, niacin, and biotin. Commercially available vitamin A sources may be included in the compositions. As used herein, “vitamin A” includes, but is not limited to, vitamin A (retinol), β-carotene, retinol palmitate, and retinol acetate. The vitamin A may be in any form, for example, an oil, such that the vitamin composition is easily dispersed or provided to a coffee bean or coffee grounds. Where vitamin A is present in the compositions, the composition comprises at least about 1% to 100% of the U.S. Recommended Daily Intake (USRDI) of such vitamin. Typically, wherein vitamin A is included within the compositions of the disclosure, the compositions comprise from about 0.0001% to about 0.25% by weight of the product. Commercially available sources of vitamin B 2 (also known as riboflavin) may be utilized in the coffee compositions of the disclosure. When Vitamin B 2 is present in the compositions of the disclosure, it is present at about 1% to about 100% of the USRDI of such vitamin. Commercially available sources of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) can be used herein. For example, such available sources include edible salts of ascorbic acid. Where vitamin C is present in a coffee composition of the disclosure, the vitamin is present from about 1% to 100% of the USRDI of such vitamin. Typically vitamin C will be present from about 0.005% to about 0.25% by weight of the coffee composition. Commercial sources of iodine may be utilized herein. Other sources of iodine include iodine-containing salts, e.g., sodium iodide, potassium iodide, potassium iodate, sodium iodate, or mixtures thereof. Minerals which may be included in the compositions herein are, for example, magnesium, zinc, iodine, iron, and copper. Any soluble salt of these minerals suitable for inclusion in a coffee composition can be used, for example, magnesium citrate, magnesium gluconate, magnesium sulfate, zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, potassium iodide, copper sulfate, copper gluconate, and copper citrate. Calcium may be used in the compositions and methods of the disclosure. Forms of calcium include amino acid chelated calcium, calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, calcium phosphate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium dihydrogen phosphate, calcium citrate, calcium malate, calcium titrate, calcium gluconate, calcium realate, calcium tantrate, and calcium lactate, and calcium citrate-malate. Ferrous iron is typically better utilized by the body than ferric iron. Bioavailable ferrous salts that can be used in the ingestible compositions of the present disclosure are ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous succinate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous lactate, ferrous tartarate, ferrous citrate, ferrous amino acid chelates, as well as mixtures of these ferrous salts. While ferrous iron is typically more bioavailable, certain ferric salts can also provide highly bioavailable sources of iron. Bioavailable ferric salts that can be used in coffee compositions of the disclosure are ferric ammonium citrate, ferric citrate, ferric saccharate, ferric sulfate, and combinations thereof. In addition to the foregoing, other source of iron are known in the art. In addition, to the compositions of the disclosure, methods of making such compositions are also provided. The methods of the disclosure are useful in preparing functionalized coffee bean compositions and functionalized coffee ground compositions. Such compositions are useful to produce coffee drinks and provide health benefits to subject that consume the drinks. Coffee beans are first roasted by methods standard in the industry. Any coffee bean may be used, and various roasting equipment and processes well known in the coffee arts may be employed. In another aspect, the coffee beans are first roasted by methods standard in the industry and ground in any conventional manner to provide a particulate, ground coffee. Various roasting and grinding equipment and processes well known in the coffee arts may be employed. Typically whole coffee beans are ground in a plate grinder with a resulting particle size distribution as follows. Using Tyler screens, approximately 8% is retained on a #8 sieve, approximately 65% is retained on a #28 sieve, with approximately 27% passing through as a fine powder. The functional additives employed in the disclosure may be provided as a powder or particulate compositions. In some embodiments, the functional additives are soluble in water or other biocompatible solvent. Where functional additives are obtain they may be converted into powders using conventional grinders or mills. Typically the functional additives are reduced to powders having a size range of less than 100 microns, and more typically in the range of 20 to 70 microns. Where coffee beans are to be “functionalized” a preparation of at least one non-vitamin, non-mineral functional additive is prepared in a soluble or dispersed form in a solvent (e.g., water or propylene glycol). The solvent comprising the functional additive is the spray coated or dispersed onto roast coffee beans. The functional additive may be provided to the beans under conditions that allow absorption of the functional additive into or onto the bean. One or more mineral and/or vitamin additives may also be coated or sprayed onto the coffee beans. The roast coffee beans are allowed to dry under appropriate conditions and then packaged. When ground coffee is used, the ground coffee and at least one non-vitamin, non-mineral functional additive in powdered form is mixed to provide a substantially homogeneous coffee-blend. One or more mineral and/or vitamin additives may also be mixed into the ground coffee. This mixing may be achieved in any conventional food mixer suitable for use with particulate and powdered materials. In one aspect, a fluidized bed technique may be used. The dry powdered functional additives and ground coffee should be mixed shortly after the coffee beans are ground to take advantage of the ground coffee's natural oils which may act to bind the coffee grounds and powdered vitamins. In addition, the oils upon heating assist in the chemical availability of some functional additives assisting the bodies ability to assimilate the functional additive in a way that speeds the desired effect and enhances the net available effect of the active ingredients. In some areas of health science this is called an “Enhanced Messaging Effect” associated with a functional additive. In another embodiment, the specific gravity, weight, and/or particle size of the ground coffee is matched with that of the powdered functional additives to provide a substantially homogenous mixture and to help prevent settling and separation of the individual constituents during shipment and storage. Once the ground coffee comprising the functional additive is prepared, the mixture is packaged using any conventional packaging technique. Typically the packaging will create a vapor seal to maintain freshness. In another aspect of the disclosure a fluidized bed technique is used to combine one or more functional additives with coffee beans and/or coffee grounds. Significant amounts of solid materials are processed using fluid-bed technology. Suspension and movement of particles in an airstream maximizes the exposure of particle surfaces to air or gas, producing efficient evaporation. Typical batch fluid-bed processors are used to perform drying, agglomeration, mixing, and coating operations. Sophisticated controls, computer systems that monitor process parameters, and air handlers equipped with temperature and humidity controls are some of the innovations that have increased the range of applications for batch fluid-bed processing. A fluidized bed is a bed of solid particles with a stream of air or gas passing upward through the particles at a rate great enough to set them in motion. An expanded bed is formed when the gas or airflow rate increases and particles move apart. A few visibly vibrate and move about in restricted regions. At still higher velocities of airflow, all the particles become suspended. At this point, the frictional force between a particle and air balances the weight of the particles, the vertical component of the compressive force between adjacent particles disappears, and the pressure drop through any section of the bed approximates the weight of air and particles in that section. The bed is referred to as an incipiently fluidized bed or a bed at minimum fluidization. As the air travels through the particle bed, it imparts unique properties to the bed. For example, the bed behaves like a liquid. It is possible to propagate wave motion, which creates the potential for improved mixing. The surface area of fluidized particles is large, which improves heat transfer, reduces process time, and imparts reproducible operating parameters. Thus, the fluid bed can be used to agglomerate particles, improve flow properties, instantize the product, produce coated particles, pellets, or tablets, taste-mask bitter products, or effect uniform chemical reactions in a controlled fashion. When particles, beads, or tablets enter the high-velocity spout, they are uniformly accelerated and physically separated from each other. As the high-velocity air and the particles move up, the coating is applied by a spray nozzle mounted at the base of the spout. The process air that moves the particles also serves to dry the coating. Because of the large amounts of air used, excellent drying is achieved by this process. When the airstream and particles clear the top of the partition, the air in the spout spreads out to fill the expansion chamber, and the particles settle out on the top of the bed of fluidized particles. Because the bed of particles is fluidized by air, additional drying occurs as the particles descend to the bottom of the bed and reenter the partition, where they are accelerated again by the high-velocity airstream and receive additional coating. In some instances heated air is used to dry the product. During the drying, agglomerating, and coating processes, the drying capacity of the air must be carefully monitored to preserve the natural oil content inherent in freshly ground coffee. To move air in a fluid bed, blowers or exhaust fans mounted outside of the processing area impart motion and pressure to the air using a paddle-wheel action. The moving air acquires a force or pressure component in its direction of motion because of its weight and inertia. This force is called velocity pressure and is measured in inches or millimeters of water column. In operating duct systems, a second pressure that is independent of air velocity or movement is always present. Known as static pressure, it acts equally in all directions. In exhaust systems (such as fluid beds), a negative static pressure will exist on the inlet side of the fan. Total pressure is the combination of static and velocity pressures. Airflow in coating a coffee bean composition and/or coffee grounds (i.e., substrate) can be performed in fluid-bed equipment using a top spray, a bottom spray with a Wurster column, or a rotary coater. The coating process involves the deposition of droplets on the substrate material, followed by spreading and coalescing of the droplets, which form a continuous layer as they adhere to the matrix. Throughout the process, solvent is evaporating. The disclosure also provides methods and compositions for preparing a functionalized coffee at a point of purchase. A point of purchase can be a store or any other commercial vendor (e.g., a cafe or other coffee shop). The disclosure also contemplates on-line ordering of functionalized coffee beverages/drinks via the Internet. In these point of purchase embodiments, a customer will identify a functional additive from a menu. The customer will also identify a coffee bean or ground coffee type (e.g., a flavored coffee, a decaffeinated coffee and the like). An employee will then select the identified functional additive and/or coffee-type and prepare a functionalized coffee composition by grinding the coffee bean to provide coffee grounds. The employee combines an appropriate amount of a functional additive (e.g., from about 0.01% to 20% (e.g., 0.1% to 15%) by weight of the functional additive with the coffee ground and mix the functional additive and the coffee grounds to provide a substantially homogenous mixture to obtain a functionalized coffee composition. The employee may than package the functionalized coffee composition or extract the functionalized coffee preparation by brewing the preparation under standard brewing temperatures and techniques to obtain a functional coffee drink. The disclosure also includes functionalized coffee beverages or drinks. The functionalized coffee beverages or drinks are obtained by extraction (i.e., brewing) of ground coffee comprising a functional additive. The functionalized coffee beverage or drink may be packaged in cans or bottles. A number of embodiments of the disclosure have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.","20080057162"
